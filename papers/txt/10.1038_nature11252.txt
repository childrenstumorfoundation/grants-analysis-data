Comprehensive molecular characterization
of human colon and rectal cancer

The Cancer Genome Atlas Network*

To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal carcinoma, we conducted a genome-scale analysis of 276 samples,
analysing exome sequence, DNA copy number, promoter methylation and messenger RNA and microRNA
expression. A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total,
16% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high
microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic
mismatch-repair gene and polymerase e (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum
cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly
mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations
in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications
of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2
and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and
an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression.

The Cancer Genome Atlas project plans to profile genomic changes in
20 different cancer types and has so far published results on two
cancer types1,2. We now present results from multidimensional
analyses of human colorectal carcinoma (CRC).

CRC is an important contributor to cancer mortality and morbidity.
The distinction between the colon and the rectum is largely anatomical,
but it has both surgical and radiotherapeutic management implications
and it may have an impact on prognosis. Most investigators divide
CRC biologically into those with microsatellite instability (MSI; located
primarily in the right colon and frequently associated with the CpG
island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and hyper-mutation) and those
that are microsatellite stable but chromosomally unstable.

A rich history of investigations (for a review see ref. 3) has uncovered
several critical genes and pathways important in the initiation and
progression of CRC (ref. 3). These include the WNT, RAS2MAPK,
PI3K, TGF-b, P53 and DNA mismatch-repair pathways. Large-scale
sequencing analyses4–6 have identified numerous recurrently mutated
genes and a recurrent chromosomal translocation. Despite this back-
ground, we have not had a fully integrated view of the genetic and
genomic changes and their significance for colorectal tumorigenesis.
Further insight into these changes may enable deeper understanding of
the pathophysiology of CRC and may identify potential therapeutic
targets.

Results
Tumour and normal pairs were analysed by different platforms. The
specific numbers of samples analysed by each platform are shown in
Supplementary Table 1.

Exome-sequence analysis
To define the mutational spectrum, we performed exome capture
DNA sequencing on 224 tumour and normal pairs (all mutations
are listed in Supplementary Table 2). Sequencing achieved .20-fold
coverage of at least 80% of targeted exons. The somatic mutation rates
varied considerably among the samples. Some had mutation rates of

,1 per 106 bases, whereas a few had mutations rates of .100 per 106.
We separated cases (84%) with a mutation rate of ,8.24 per 106
(median number of non-silent mutations, 58) and those with muta-
tion rates of .12 per 106 (median number of total mutations, 728),
which we designated as hypermutated (Fig. 1).

To assess the basis for the considerably different mutation rates, we
evaluated MSI7 and mutations in the DNA mismatch-repair pathway8–10
genes MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6 and PMS2. Among the 30
hypermutated tumours with a complete data set, 23 (77%) had high
levels of MSI (MSI-H). Included in this group were 19 tumours with
MLH1 methylation, 17 of which had CIMP. By comparison, the
remaining seven hypermutated tumours, including the six with the
highest mutation rates, lacked MSI-H, CIMP or MLH1 methylation
but usually had somatic mutations in one or more mismatch-repair
genes or POLE aberrations seen rarely in the non-hypermutated
tumours (Fig. 1).

Gene mutations
Overall, we identified 32 somatic recurrently mutated genes (defined
by MutSig11 and manual curation) in the hypermutated and non-
hypermutated cancers (Fig. 1b). After removal of non-expressed genes,
there were 15 and 17 in the hypermutated and non-hypermutated
cancers, respectively (Fig. 1b; for a complete list see Supplementary
Table 3). Among the non-hypermutated tumours, the eight most fre-
quently mutated genes were APC, TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, FBXW7,
SMAD4, TCF7L2 and NRAS. As expected, the mutated KRAS and
NRAS genes usually had oncogenic codon 12 and 13 or codon 61
mutations, whereas the remaining genes had inactivating mutations.
CTNNB1, SMAD2, FAM123B (also known as WTX) andSOX9 were
also mutated frequently. FAM123B is an X-linked negative regulator of
WNT signalling12, and virtually all of its mutations were loss of func-
tion. Mutations in SOX9, a gene important for cell differentiation in the
intestinal stem cell niche13,14, have not been associated previously with
human cancer, but all nine mutated alleles in the non-hypermutated
CRCs were frameshift or nonsense mutations. Tumour-suppressor

genes ATM and ARID1A also had a disproportionately high number of
frameshift or nonsense mutations. ARID1A mutations have recently
been reported in CRC and many other cancers15,16.

In the hypermutated tumours, ACVR2A, APC, TGFBR2, MSH3,
MSH6, SLC9A9 and TCF7L2 were frequent targets of mutation
(Fig. 1b), along with mostly BRAF(V600E) mutations. However,
two genes that were frequently mutated in the non-hypermutated

ARTICLE RESEARCH

cancers were significantly less frequently mutated in hypermutated
tumours: TP53 (60 versus 20%, P , 0.0001) and APC (81% versus
51%, P 5 0.0023; both Fisher’s exact test). Other genes, including
TGFBR2, were mutated recurrently in the hypermutated cancers,
but not in the non-hypermutated samples. These findings indicate
that hypermutated and non-hypermutated tumours progress through
different sequences of genetic events.

As expected, hypermutated tumours with MLH1 silencing and
MSI-H showed additional differences in the mutational profile.
When we specifically examined 28 genes with long mononucleotide
repeats in their coding sequences, we found that the rate of frameshift
mutation was 3.6-fold higher than the rate of such mutations in
hypermutated tumours without MLH1 silencing and 50-fold higher
than that in non-hypermethylated tumours (Supplementary Table 2).

Mutation rate and methylation patterns
As mentioned above, patients with colon and rectal tumours are
managed differently17, and epidemiology also highlights differences
between the two17. An initial integrative analysis of MSI status,
somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs), CIMP status and gene-
expression profiles of 132 colonic and 62 rectal tumours enabled us to
examine possible biological differences between tumours in the two
locations. Among the non-hypermutated tumours, however, the
overall patterns of changes in copy number, CIMP, mRNA and
miRNA were indistinguishable between colon and rectal carcinomas
(Fig. 2). On the basis of this result, we merged the two for all
subsequent analyses.

Unsupervised clustering of

the promoter DNA methylation
profiles of 236 colorectal tumours identified four subgroups (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Methods). Two of the clusters
contained tumours with elevated rates of methylation and were
classified as CIMP high and CIMP low, as previously described18.
The two non-CIMP clusters were predominantly from tumours that
were non-hypermutated and derived from different anatomic loca-
tions. mRNA expression profiles separated the colorectal tumours
into three distinct clusters (Supplementary Fig. 2). One significantly
overlapped with CIMP-high tumours (P 5 3 3 10212) and was
enriched with hypermutated tumours, and the other two clusters
did not correspond with any group in the methylation data.
Analysis of miRNA expression by unsupervised clustering (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3) identified no clear distinctions between rectal cancers and
non-hypermethylated colon cancers.

Hypermutated tumours have near-diploid genomes and are highly enriched for
hypermethylation, CIMP expression phenotype and BRAF(V600E) mutations.
Non-hypermutated tumours originating from different sites are virtually

indistinguishable from each other on the basis of their copy-number alteration
patterns, DNA methylation or gene-expression patterns. Copy-number
changes of the 22 autosomes are shown in shades of red for copy-number gains
and shades of blue for copy-number losses.

Chromosomal and sub-chromosomal changes
In total, 257 tumours were profiled for SCNAs with Affymetrix SNP
6.0 arrays. Of these tumours, 97 were also analysed by low-depth-of-
coverage (low-pass) whole-genome sequencing. As expected, the
hypermutated tumours had far fewer SCNAs (Fig. 2). No difference
was found between microsatellite-stable and -unstable hypermutated
tumours (Supplementary Fig. 4). We used the GISTIC algorithm19 to
identify probable gene targets of focal alterations. There were several
previously well-defined arm-level changes, including gains of 1q, 7p
and q, 8p and q, 12q, 13q, 19q, and 20p and q (ref. 6). (Supplementary
Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 4). Significantly deleted chromosome
arms were 18p and q (including SMAD4) in 66% of the tumours and
17p and q (including TP53) in 56%. Other significantly deleted chro-
mosome arms were 1p, 4q, 5q, 8p, 14q, 15q, 20p and 22q.

We identified 28 recurrent deletion peaks (Supplementary Fig. 4
and Supplementary Table 4), including the genes FHIT, RBFOX1 and
WWOX with large genomic footprints located in potentially fragile
sites of the genome, in near-diploid hypermutated tumours. Other
focal deletions involved tumour-suppressor genes such as SMAD4,
APC, PTEN and SMAD3. A significant focal deletion of 10p25.2
spanned four genes, including TCF7L2, which was also frequently
mutated in our data set. A gene fusion between adjacent genes
VTI1A and TCF7L2 through an interstitial deletion was found in
3% of CRCs and is required for survival of CRC cells bearing the
translocation4.

There were 17 regions of significant focal amplification (Supplemen-
tary Table 4). Some of these were superimposed on broad gains of
chromosome arms, and included a peak at 13q12.13 near the
peptidase-coding gene USP12 and at ,500 kb distal to the CRC

candidate oncogene CDK8; an adjacent peak at 13q12; a peak contain-
ing KLF5 at 13q22.1; and a peak at 20q13.12 adjacent to HNF4A.
Peaks on chromosome 8 included 8p12 (which contains the histone
methyl-transferase-coding gene WHSC1L1, adjacent to FGFR1) and
8q24 (which contains MYC). An amplicon at 17q21.1, found in 4% of
the tumours, contains seven genes, including the tyrosine kinase
ERBB2. ERBB2 amplifications have been described in colon, breast
and gastro–oesophageal tumours, and breast and gastric cancers bear-
ing these amplifications have been treated effectively with the anti-
ERBB2 antibody trastuzumab20–22.

One of the most common focal amplifications, found in 7% of the
tumours, is the gain of a 100–150-kb region of the chromosome arm
11p15.5. It contains genes encoding insulin (INS), insulin-like growth
factor 2 (IGF2) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as well as miR-483,
which is embedded within IGF2 (Fig. 3a). We found elevated expres-
sion of IGF2 and miR-483 but not of INS and TH (Fig. 3b, c).
Immediately adjacent to the amplified region is ASCL2, a transcrip-
tion factor active in specifying intestinal stem-cell fate23. Although
ASCL2 has been implicated as a target of amplification in CRC23–25,
it was consistently outside the region of amplification and its expres-
sion was not correlated with copy-number changes. These observa-
tions suggest that IGF2 and miR-483 are candidate functional targets
of 11p15.5 amplification. IGF2 overexpression through loss of
imprinting has been implicated in the promotion of CRC26, 27. MiR-
483 may also have a role in CRC pathogenesis28.

A subset of tumours without IGF2 amplification (15%) also had
considerably higher levels of IGF2 gene expression (as much as a
100-fold increase), an effect not attributable to methylation changes
at the IGF2 promoter. To assess the context of IGF2 amplification/

overexpression, we systematically searched for mutually exclusive
genomic events using the MEMo method29. We found a pattern of
near exclusivity (corrected P , 0.01) of IGF2 overexpression with
genomic events known to activate the PI3K pathway (mutations of
PIK3CA and PIK3R1 or deletion/mutation of PTEN; Fig. 3c and
Supplementary Table 5). The IRS2 gene, encoding a protein linking
IGF1R (the receptor for IGF2) with PI3K, is on chromosome 13, which
is frequently gained in CRC. The cases with the highest IRS2 expression
were mutually exclusive of the cases with IGF2 overexpression
(P 5 0.04) and also lacked mutations
in the PI3K pathway
(P 5 0.0001; Fig. 3c). These results strongly suggest that the IGF2–
IGF1R–IRS2 axis signals to PI3K in CRC and imply that therapeutic
targeting of the pathway could act to block PI3K activity in this subset
of patients.

Translocations
To identify new chromosomal translocations, we performed low-pass,
paired-end, whole-genome sequencing on 97 tumours with matched
normal samples. In each case we achieved sequence coverage of
,3–4-fold and a corresponding physical coverage of 7.5–10-fold.
Despite the low genome coverage, we detected 250 candidate
interchromosomal translocation events (range, 0–10 per tumour).
Among these events, 212 had one or both breakpoints in an intergenic
region, whereas the remaining 38 juxtaposed coding regions of two
genes in putative fusion events, of which 18 were predicted to code for
in-frame events (Supplementary Table 6). We found three separate
cases in which the first two exons of the NAV2 gene on chromosome
11 are joined with the 39 coding portion of TCF7L1 on chromosome 2
(Supplementary Fig. 5). TCF7L1 encodes TCF3, a member of the
TCF/LEF class of transcription factors that heterodimerize with
nuclear b-catenin to enable b-catenin-mediated transcriptional regu-
lation. Intriguingly, in all three cases, the predicted structure of the
NAV2–TCF7L1 fusion protein lacks the TCF3 b-catenin-binding
domain. This translocation is similar to another recurrent transloca-
tion identified in CRC, a fusion in which the amino terminus of
VTI1A is joined to TCF4, which is encoded by TCF7L2, a homologue
of TCF7L1 that is deleted or mutated in 12% of non-hypermutated
tumours4. We also observed 21 cases of translocation involving
TTC28 located on chromosome 22 (Supplementary Table 6). In all

cases the fusions predict inactivation of TTC28, which has been iden-
tified as a target of P53 and an inhibitor of tumour cell growth30.
Eleven of the 19 (58%) gene–gene translocations were validated by
obtaining PCR products or, in some cases, sequencing the junction
fragments (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Altered pathways in CRC
Integrated analysis of mutations, copy number and mRNA expression
changes in 195 tumours with complete data enriched our understand-
ing of how some well-defined pathways are deregulated. We grouped
samples by hypermutation status and identified recurrent alterations
in the WNT, MAPK, PI3K, TGF-b and p53 pathways (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 1).

We found that the WNT signalling pathway was altered in 93% of
all tumours, including biallelic inactivation of APC (Supplementary
Table 7) or activating mutations of CTNNB1 in ,80% of cases. There
were also mutations in SOX9 and mutations and deletions in TCF7L2,
as well as the DKK family members and AXIN2, FBXW7 (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7), ARID1A and FAM123B (the latter is a negative regulator
of WNT–b-catenin signalling12 found mutated in Wilms’ tumour31).
A few mutations in FAM123B have previously been described in
CRC32. SOX9 has been suggested to have a role in cancer, but no
mutations have previously been described. The WNT receptor
frizzled (FZD10) was overexpressed in ,17% of samples, in some
instances at levels of 1003 normal. Altogether, we found 16 different
altered WNT pathway genes, confirming the importance of this
pathway in CRC. Interestingly, many of these alterations were found
in tumours that harbour APC mutations, suggesting that multiple
lesions affecting the WNT signalling pathway confer selective advantage.
Genetic alterations in the PI3K and RAS–MAPK pathways are
common in CRC. In addition to IGF2 and IRS2 overexpression, we
found mutually exclusive mutations in PIK3R1 and PIK3CA as well as
deletions in PTEN in 2%, 15% and 4% of non-hypermutated tumours,
respectively. We found that 55% of non-hypermutated tumours have
alterations in KRAS, NRAS or BRAF, with a significant pattern of
mutual exclusivity (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 1).
We also evaluated mutations in the erythroblastic leukemia viral
oncogene homolog (ERBB) family of receptors because of the trans-
lational relevance of such mutations. Mutations or amplifications in

RESEARCH ARTICLE

one of the four ERBB family genes are present in 22 out of 165
(13%) non-hypermutated and 16 out of 30 (53%) hypermutated
cases. Some of the mutations are listed in the COSMIC database33,
suggesting a functional role. Intriguingly, recurrent ERBB2(V842I)
and ERBB3(V104M) mutations were found in four and two non-
hypermutated cases, respectively. Mutations and focal amplifications
of ERBB2 (Supplementary Fig. 6) should be evaluated as predictors
of response to agents that target those receptors. We observed
co-occurrence of alterations involving the RAS and PI3K pathways
in one-third of tumours (Fig. 4; P 5 0.039, Fisher’s exact test). These
results indicate that simultaneous inhibition of the RAS and PI3K
pathways may be required to achieve therapeutic benefit.

The TGF-b signalling pathway is known to be deregulated in CRC
and other cancers34. We found genomic alterations in TGFBR1,
TGFBR2, ACVR2A, ACVR1B, SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 in 27%
of the non-hypermutated and 87% of the hypermutated tumours. We
also evaluated the p53 pathway, finding alterations in TP53 in 59% of
non-hypermutated cases (mostly biallelic; Supplementary Table 8)
and alterations in ATM, a kinase that phosphorylates and activates
P53 after DNA damage, in 7%. Alterations in these two genes showed
a trend towards mutual exclusivity (P 5 0.016) (Fig. 4, Supplementary
Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 1).

We integrated copy number, gene expression, methylation and
pathway data using the PARADIGM software platform35. The
analysis showed a number of new characteristics of CRC (Fig. 5a).
For example, despite the diversity in anatomical origin or mutation
levels, nearly 100% of these tumours have changes in MYC transcrip-
tional targets, both those promoted by and those inhibited by MYC.
These findings are consistent with patterns deduced from genetic
alterations (Fig. 4) and suggest an important role for MYC in CRC.
The analysis also identified several gene networks altered across all
tumour samples and those with differential alterations in hypermutated
versus non-hypermutated samples (Supplementary Table 7, Supplemen-
tary Data on the Cancer Genome Atlas publication webpage).

Because most of the tumours used in this study were derived from a
prospective collection, survival data are not available. However, the
tumours can be classified as aggressive or non-aggressive on the basis

of tumour stage, lymph node status, distant metastasis and vascular
invasion at the time of surgery. We found numerous molecular
signatures associated with tumour aggressiveness, a subset of which
is shown in Fig. 5b. They include specific focal amplifications and
deletions, and altered gene-expression levels,
including those of
SCN5A (ref. 36), a reported regulator of colon cancer invasion (see
Supplementary Tables 10 and 11 for a full list). Association with
tumour aggressiveness is also observed in altered expression of
miRNAs and specific somatic mutations (APC, TP53, PIK3CA,
BRAF and FBXW7; Supplementary Fig. 8b). Mutations in FBXW7
(38 cases) and distant metastasis (32 cases) never co-occurred
(P 5 0.0019). Interestingly, a number of genomic regions have multiple
molecular associations with tumour aggressiveness that manifest as
clinically related genomic hotspots. Examples of this are the region
20q13.12, which includes a focal amplification and multiple genes
correlating with tumour aggression, and the region 22q12.3, contain-
ing APOL6 (ref. 37) (Supplementary Figures 8 and 9).

Discussion
This comprehensive integrative analysis of 224 colorectal tumour and
normal pairs provides a number of insights into the biology of CRC
and identifies potential therapeutic targets. To identify possible bio-
logical differences in colon and rectum tumours, we found, in the
non-hypermutated tumours irrespective of their anatomical origin,
the same type of copy number, expression profile, DNA methylation
and miRNA changes. Over 94% had a mutation in one or more
members of the WNT signalling pathway, predominantly in APC.
However, there were some differences between tumours from the
right colon and all other sites. Hypermethylation was more common
in the right colon, and three-quarters of hypermutated samples came
from the same site, although not all of them had MSI (Fig. 2). Why
most of the hypermutated samples came from the right colon and why
there are two classes of tumours at this site is not known. The origins
of the colon from embryonic midgut and hindgut may provide an
explanation. As the survival rate of patients with high MSI-related
cancers is better and these cancers are hypermutated, mutation rate
may be a better prognostic indicator.

Molecular signatures (rows) that show a statistically significant association with

shown in colour, with red indicating markers of tumour aggressiveness and

blue indicating the markers of less-aggressive tumours. Significance is based on
the combined P value from the weighted Fisher’s method, corrected for
multiple testing. Colour intensity and score is in accordance with the strength of
an individual clinical–molecular association, and is proportional to log10(P),
where P is the P value for that association. To limit the vertical extent of the
figure, gene-expression signatures are restricted to a combined P value of
P , 1029 and SCNAs to P , 1027, and features are shown only if they are also
significant in the subset of non-MSI-H samples (the analysis was performed
separately on the full data as well as on the MSI-H and non-MSI-H subgroups).

Whole-exome sequencing and integrative analysis of genomic data
provided further insights into the pathways that are dysregulated in
CRC. We found that 93% of non-hypermutated and 97% of hyper-
mutated cases had a deregulated WNT signalling pathway. New find-
ings included recurrent mutations in FAM123B, ARID1A and SOX9
and very high levels of overexpression of the WNT ligand receptor
gene FZD10. To our knowledge, SOX9 has not previously been
described as frequently mutated in any human cancer. SOX9 is tran-
scriptionally repressed by WNT signalling, and the SOX9 protein has
been shown to facilitate b-catenin degradation38. ARID1A is fre-
quently mutated in gynaecological cancers and has been shown to
suppress MYC transcription39. Activation of WNT signalling and
inactivation of the TGF-b signalling pathway are known to result in
activation of MYC. Our mutational and integrative analyses emphasize
the critical role of MYC in CRC. We also compared our results with
other large-scale analyses6 and found many similarities and few differ-
ences in mutated genes (Supplementary Table 3).

Our integrated analysis revealed a diverse set of changes in TCF/
LEF-encoding genes, suggesting additional roles for TCF/LEF factors
in CRC beyond being passive partners for b-catenin.

Our data suggest a number of therapeutic approaches to CRC.
Included are WNT-signalling inhibitors and small-molecule b-catenin
inhibitors, which are showing initial promise40–42. We find that several
proteins in the RTK–RAS and PI3K pathways,
including IGF2,
IGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, MEK, AKT and MTOR could be targets for
inhibition.

Our analyses show that non-hypermutated adenocarcinomas of the
colon and rectum are not distinguishable at the genomic level.
However, tumours from the right/ascending colon were more likely
to be hypermethylated and to have elevated mutation rates than were
other CRCs. As has been recognized previously, activation of the
WNT signalling pathway and inactivation of the TGF-b signalling
pathway, resulting in increased activity of MYC, are nearly ubiquitous
events in CRC. Genomic aberrations frequently target the MAPK and
PI3K pathways but less frequently target receptor tyrosine kinases. In
conclusion, the data presented here provide a useful resource for
understanding this deadly disease and identifying possibilities for
treating it in a targeted way.

METHODS SUMMARY
Tumour and normal samples were processed by either of two biospecimen core
resources, and aliquots of purified nucleic acids were shipped to the genome
characterization and sequencing centres (Supplementary Methods). The bio-
specimen core resources provided sample sets in several different batches. To
assess any batch effects we examined the mRNA expression, miRNA expression
and DNA methylation data sets using a combination of cluster analysis, enhanced
principal component analysis and analysis of variance (Supplementary Methods).
Although some differences among batches were detected, we did not correct them
computationally because the differences were generally modest and because some
of them may reflect biological phenomena (Supplementary Methods).

We used Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays to detect copy-number alterations. A
subset of samples was subjected to low-pass (2–53) whole-genome sequencing
(Illumina HiSeq), in part for detection of SCNA and chromosomal transloca-
tions43,44. Gene-expression profiles were generated using Agilent microarrays and
RNA-Seq. DNA methylation data were obtained using Illumina Infinium
(HumanMethylation27) arrays. DNA sequencing of coding regions was per-
formed by exome capture followed by sequencing on the SOLiD or Illumina
HiSeq platforms. Details of the analytical methods used are described in
Supplementary Methods.

All of the primary sequence files are deposited in dbGap and all other data are
deposited at the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for public access (http://
cancergenome.nih.gov/). Data matrices and supporting data can be found at
