Abstract—The glial cell
line– derived neurotrophic factor
(GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) are a group of peptides that
have been implicated as important factors in inﬂammation,
since they are released in increased amounts during inﬂam-
mation and induce thermal hyperalgesia upon injection.
Mouse isolated sensory neurons in culture and freshly dis-
sociated spinal cord slices were used to examine the en-
hancement in stimulated-release of the neuropeptide, calci-
tonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), as a measure of sensiti-
zation. Exposure of isolated sensory neurons in culture to
GDNF, neurturin, and artemin enhanced the capsaicin-stim-
ulated release of immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related
peptide (iCGRP) two- to threefold, but did not increase po-
tassium-stimulated release of iCGRP. A similar proﬁle of sen-
sitization was observed in freshly dissociated spinal cord
slices. Persephin, another member of the GFL family thought
to be important in development, was unable to induce an
enhancement in the release of iCGRP. These results demon-
strate that speciﬁc GFLs are important mediators affecting
sensory neuronal sensitivity, likely through modulation of the
capsaicin receptor. The sensitization of sensory neurons dur-
ing inﬂammation, and the pain and neurogenic inﬂammation
resulting from this sensitization, may be due in part to the
effects of these selected GFLs. © 2009 IBRO. Published by

Inﬂammatory mediators, which are released in increased
amounts in a number of diseases (Schaible et al., 2002;
Yang et al., 2003), are implicated in hyperalgesia and
sensory neuronal sensitization. Growth factors are one set
of mediators found in higher concentrations during inﬂam-
mation. Although growth factors previously were thought to

be responsible only for the growth and maintenance of
sensory neurons, they are postulated now to be responsi-
ble for inﬂammatory hyperalgesia (Mendell et al., 1999).
Nerve growth factor (NGF) is one such mediator with an
established role in inﬂammatory hyperalgesia and sensory
neuronal sensitization (Lewin et al., 1993; McMahon,
1996; Shu and Mendell, 1999). Another set of molecules
found in higher amounts during inﬂammation is the glial
cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands
(GFLs). The levels of GFLs in the joint capsule and plasma
of patients with osteoarthritis, Crohn’s disease, and inter-
stitial cystitis are greatly increased compared to people
without these diseases (Okragly et al., 1999; De et al.,
2004; von Boyen et al., 2006). Induction of inﬂammation by
injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) or lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS) results in increased levels of the GFLs,
GDNF, neurturin (NTN), and artemin (ART; Amaya et al.,
2004; Hashimoto et al., 2005; Malin et al., 2006).

The GFLs are a group of small peptides in the TGF␤
super-family of molecules. They exist naturally as ho-
modimers and include GDNF, NTN, ART, and persephin
(PSP; Eigenbrot and Gerber, 1997; Wang et al., 2003).
The actions of GFLs are initiated by binding to speciﬁc glial
cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha
subtypes (GFR␣), glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)–linked
surface receptors found in lipid rafts. The GFL-GFR␣com-
plex translocates to the receptor tyrosine kinase, Ret, to
initiate intracellular signaling (reviewed by Saarma, 2001;
Sariola and Saarma, 2003). Higher binding afﬁnity is found
for GDNF and GFR␣1, NTN and GFR␣2, ART and GFR␣3
and PSP and GFR␣4. Non-speciﬁc binding can occur be-
tween GDNF and GFR␣2 or GFR␣3 (Airaksinen and
Saarma, 2002). Evidence also exists for non-speciﬁc bind-
ing of ART and NTN to GFR␣1 (Airaksinen and Saarma,
2002).

There is a growing body of evidence that, through
binding to and translocation of GFR␣ receptors, select
GFLs (GDNF, NTN, and ART) play a role in the induction
of hyperalgesia (Amaya et al., 2004; Malin et al., 2006;
Vellani et al., 2006). Importantly, there is signiﬁcant over-
lap in the expression of the GFR␣1-3 receptors and the
transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) recep-
tor, a ligand-gated ion channel that is activated by noxious
stimuli, including heat and acidic pH (Aoki et al., 2005;
Malin et al., 2006). Application of GDNF to isolated sen-
sory neurons increases their inward ﬂux of calcium in
response to capsaicin, a molecule used to activate TRPV1,
and the number of TRPV1 channels present on the neu-
rons (Anand et al., 2006). These same selected GFLs

enhance both the peak calcium current and area under the
curve of the calcium current in response to capsaicin in
isolated sensory neurons, presumably via activation of the
TRPV1 channel (Malin et al., 2006). Additionally,
in-
creased expression of acid sensing ion channels (ASICs)
has been observed in the skin in response to GDNF ex-
posure (Albers et al., 2006).

While there is evidence that select GFLs increase
TRPV1-mediated calcium inﬂux in sensory neurons, the
cellular consequences of this change have not been es-
tablished. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related pep-
tide (CGRP), found predominantly in small diameter, noci-
ceptive sensory neurons, has a high degree of co-localiza-
tion with TRPV1 (Aoki et al., 2005). CGRP functions as a
mediator of neurogenic inﬂammation in the periphery and
has been associated with potentiation of the pain signal
from primary sensory neurons to second order neurons in
the spinal cord (Brain et al., 1985; Miletic and Tan, 1988;
Ryu et al., 1988). To determine if GFLs alter the integrative
activity of the primary sensory neuron, the ability of GFLs
to alter the release of immunoreactive calcitonin gene-
related peptide (iCGRP) from dorsal root ganglia (DRG)
neurons was examined. Increase in the release of iCGRP
indicating peripheral sensitization,
from DRG neurons,
could account
for the hyperalgesia induced by
GFLs.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Materials

The mice used for all experiments, C57BL/6 mice, were pur-
chased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and/or
bred and housed in the Indiana University Laboratory Animal
Research Center (LARC). Mice were housed in group cages in a
light-controlled room at a constant temperature of 22 °C. All mice
were adults, between 3 and 6 months in age. Food and water were
available at the convenience of the animals. Capsaicin was pur-
chased from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA) and
was ﬁrst dissolved in 1-methyl,2-pyrrolidinone (Aldrich Chemical,
Co., Milwaukee, WI, USA) to a concentration of 10 mM. It was
then serially diluted to a concentration of 50 –500 nM in the
appropriate release buffer as noted below. Horse serum, F-12
medium, L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased
from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). NGF was purchased from
Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Col-
lagenase, poly-D-lysine, laminin, 5-ﬂuoro-2-deoxyuridine, uridine
and standard laboratory chemicals were from Sigma. Antibody to
CGRP was generously provided by Michael R. Vasko (Indiana
University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA and originally
produced by Michael J. Iadarola, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The
GFLs were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hills, NJ, USA).

Preparation of DRG cultures

DRG from adult mice were used to establish sensory neuronal
cultures. Brieﬂy, the DRG were removed from adult mice in a
manner similar to that previously published (Hingtgen et al., 2006).
DRG were digested in 0.1% collagenase in two separate 30-min
incubations at 37 °C. Additionally, cells were digested in DNase
for 1 min at room temperature. Lastly, the preparation was disso-
ciated by mechanical agitation. Cells were plated in wells of 24-
well falcon culture dishes coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin at
a density of 30,000 –50,000 cells/well. Cultures were maintained
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in F12 media supplemented

with 2 mM glutamine, 50 ␮g/mL penicillin and streptomycin, 10%
heat-inactivated horse serum and mitotic inhibitors (50 ␮M
5-ﬂuoro-2-deoxyuridine and 150 ␮M uridine). NGF, at a concen-
tration of 30 ng/mL, was added to this medium. Growth medium
was changed every 2–3 days, and the added NGF removed 48 h
prior to all experiments.

Stimulated-release of iCGRP

Measurement of stimulus-evoked release and content of iCGRP
from isolated sensory neurons was accomplished as previously
published (Hingtgen et al., 2006). After 5–7 days in culture, culture
medium was removed from the sensory neurons in culture and the
basal or resting release of iCGRP measured from cells incubated
for 10 min in Hepes buffer consisting of (in mM): 25 Hepes, 135
NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 3.3 dextrose, and 0.1% (w/v)
bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, and maintained at 37 °C. The cells
were incubated in Hepes buffer containing stimulus (capsaicin or
high potassium) for 10 min, and then incubated again with Hepes
buffer alone to reestablish resting release levels. The concentra-
tions of capsaicin and potassium were chosen because they lie on
the low end of the highly sloped portion of the concentration
response curve for iCGRP release (data not shown). The use of
these concentrations allows for evaluation of enhancement in
release of CGRP after exposure to sensitizing molecules. The
amount of iCGRP released in each incubation was measured by
radioimmunoassay (RIA). After the release protocol, the remain-
ing peptide content in each well was determined by exposing the
cells to 2 N acetic acid for 10 min. Aliquots of this incubation were
diluted in Hepes and iCGRP was determined by RIA. The release
of iCGRP during the 10-min incubation period is expressed as
percent of the total content. GFLs were added in the basal incu-
bation period (10 min) and in the stimulated incubation period (10
additional minutes). The neurons were exposed to GFLs for a total
time of 20 min. A minimum of three different preparations was
used for each condition, including growth factor application and
stimulus.

Stimulus-evoked release and content of iCGRP from spinal
cord slices was accomplished as previously published (Chen et
al., 1996; Southall et al., 1998). Brieﬂy, the entire spinal cord was
removed from each animal. It was weighed and chopped into
300 ␮m cross-sections using a McIllwain Tissue Chopper. The
chopped spinal cord from each animal was placed into its own
individual chamber and perfused at a rate of 0.1 mL/min for 20 min
with Hepes buffer supplemented with 200 mM ascorbic acid, 100
␮M Phe–Ala, and 20 ␮M bacitracin (all used as peptidase inhib-
itors to prevent the breakdown of CGRP during the process; Chen
et al., 1996). The perfusion buffer was aerated with 95% O2/5%
CO2 and maintained at a pH of 7.4. Serial 10-min collections (1.0
mL of perfusate) were obtained from each spinal cord. Initially, the
tissue was perfused with Hepes buffer alone or Hepes buffer
containing 10 ng/mL growth factor for 30 min. The perfusate was
changed to Hepes buffer containing 500 nM capsaicin⫾10 ng/mL
growth factor for 30 min to measure stimulated release. For re-
lease experiments in spinal cord tissue, 500 nM capsaicin was
used as a stimulus for peptide release. The higher concentration
was used to ensure proper penetrance of the capsaicin into the
tissue because of the lipophilic nature of capsaicin and the sub-
stantial density of the spinal cord tissue, and based on previous
uses of this method (Chen et al., 1996; Southall et al., 1998). The
tissue was perfused for 60 min with Hepes buffer after the stimulus
exposure to allow a return to resting levels of peptide release.
Aliquots from each 10-min collection period were assayed for
iCGRP using RIA. After the protocol was completed, the remain-
ing iCGRP content of the tissue was determined by homogenizing
the spinal cord tissue in 0.1 N HCl and serially diluting the super-
natant with Hepes buffer and 1.0 M MES. The content was added
to the amount of iCGRP released during the entire perfusion to
obtain the total peptide content. The release of iCGRP during

sensory neurons in culture are between 1 ng/mL and 100
ng/mL (Malin et al., 2006; Price et al., 2005). These con-
centrations correspond to 0.0667– 6.67 nM for GDNF,
0.0847– 8.47 nM for NTN, 0.0833– 8.83 nM for ART, and
0.0971–9.71 nM for PSP. To determine if the actions of
GFLs on the TRPV1 receptor result in increased functional
output, such as enhanced transmitter release, the ability of
different GFLs to modulate the stimulated-release of
iCGRP from isolated sensory neurons was measured.
Studies of the effects of the GFLs on sensory neuronal
sensitization were conducted with concentrations of the
GFLs between 0.1 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL to remain in the
physiological range and to correspond to concentrations
used in similar experiments.

Individual preparations of isolated sensory neurons in
culture were exposed to different concentrations of GDNF
for 10 min prior to and during a 10-min capsaicin-stimu-
lated period. In the absence of GDNF, basal release of
iCGRP was 7.15⫾1.25 fmol/well and capsaicin-stimulated
release was 78.84⫾6.21 fmol/well (mean⫾SEM). When
expressed as the percent of the total content of iCGRP in
the well, these values correspond to 0.45%⫾0.11% in the
basal condition and 4.19%⫾0.93% in the capsaicin-stim-
ulated condition (Fig. 1). When 1 or 10 ng/mL GDNF was
added, capsaicin-stimulated release of iCGRP was signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced (no GFL: 4.19%⫾0.93%, 0.1 ng/mL GDNF:
6.74%⫾1.87%, 1.0 ng/mL GDNF: 8.45%⫾1.05%, 10 ng/mL
GDNF: 8.35%⫾1.16%, 100 ng/mL GDNF: 6.34%⫾1.15%;
Fig. 1). There was no change in the basal release of iCGRP
with exposure to GDNF. In addition, and as seen in Fig. 2, 10
ng/mL NTN and ART also signiﬁcantly enhanced the capsa-
icin-stimulated release of iCGRP (no GLF: 4.30%⫾0.58%,
NTN: 10.60%⫾1.70%, ART: 10.00%⫾1.57%). Unlike the

than basal release.

each 10-min period of perfusion is expressed as percent of the
total iCGRP content for the tissue.

An RIA was used to quantify the amount of iCGRP released in
the basal and stimulated conditions for both experiments with cells
in culture and spinal cord tissue. The minimum amount of iCGRP
detected by the RIA is 5 fmol with a 95% conﬁdence interval (Chen
et al., 1996). Additionally, the GFLs are peptides, which have the
potential to affect the RIA. To that end, separate standard curves
for the RIA were conducted using Hepes buffer containing each of
the GFLs at the highest concentration used in experiments. None
of the GFLs affected the sensitivity of the RIA (data not shown).

Statistical analyses

Results, represented as percent total content of iCGRP, are ex-
pressed as the mean⫾standard error of the mean (SEM). All
differences in iCGRP release and total content were compared
with analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and Dunnett’s post hoc
analysis or Student’s t-tests, as indicated. A P-value of ⬍0.05 was
used to indicate statistical signiﬁcance between treatment and
non-treatment groups.

RESULTS

GFLs enhance the capsaicin-stimulated release of
iCGRP from isolated sensory neurons

The levels of the GFLs are increased during inﬂammation
(Aloe et al., 1992) and treatment of isolated sensory neu-
rons with GFLs increases intracellular calcium levels in
response to capsaicin (Malin et al., 2006). While the local
levels of the GFLs near the sensory neurons in intact
animals have not been established, levels in whole brain
(Kirik et al., 2000) and in plasma (Onodera et al., 1999) are
in the high pg/mL and low ng/mL range. Additionally, the
concentrations of the GFLs used in previous experiments
on freshly dissociated sensory neuronal preparations and

other GFLs, PSP did not alter the capsaicin-stimulated re-
lease of iCGRP (PSP: 3.40%⫾0.52%). This may result from
a lack of functional GFR␣4 in adult DRG neurons, and the
fact that PSP binds speciﬁcally to GFR␣4 (Enokido et al.,
1998; Paveliev et al., 2004). Even at concentrations as high
as 500 ng/mL, PSP was unable to enhance the capsaicin-
stimulated release of iCGRP (Table 1). Additionally, to en-
sure that the GFLs did not directly alter the resting release of
iCGRP, sensory neurons were exposed to the GFLs for two
consecutive 10-min incubations in the absence of any stim-
ulus. No enhancement in the release of iCGRP was observed
with these treatments (Table 2). These data indicate that
GDNF, NTN, and ART alter the sensitivity of sensory neurons
to capsaicin stimulation, but do not directly evoke the release
of CGRP.

When sensory neurons are exposed to the GFLs for
several days, the levels of CGRP are increased (Ramer et
al., 2003; Price et al., 2005). To ensure that the GFL-
induced enhancement in capsaicin-stimulated release of
iCGRP was not the result of an increase in the total content
of iCGRP, we measured iCGRP content at the end of each
experiment. There was no change in the total content of
iCGRP after the 20-min exposure to the GFLs (no GFL:
1487⫾154 fmol/well, GDNF: 1322⫾108 fmol/well, NTN:
1500⫾128 fmol/well, ART: 1320⫾102 fmol/well, and PSP:
1518⫾177 fmol/well, n⫽9 –22 wells per condition).

NGF treatment of sensory neuronal cultures increases
the expression of TRPV1 (Xue et al., 2007) and increases
the amount of TRPV1 insertion into the plasma membrane
(Stein et al., 2006). Additionally, sensory neuronal expo-
sure to NGF in culture increases the expression of CGRP
and other neuropeptides (MacLean et al., 1989; Sango et
al., 1994). Therefore, there is a possibility that some of the
media components, speciﬁcally the NGF, are affecting
the responses of the sensory neurons to either or both the
capsaicin and the GFLs. To address this concern, we
conducted CGRP release studies on neurons grown in the
presence or absence of NGF to determine whether this
change in the media components would alter the capsa-
icin-stimulated release and the GFL-induced enhancement
in this release. The presence or absence of NGF in the
culture media did not change the magnitude of capsaicin-
stimulated release of iCGRP or the GDNF-induced en-
hancement of peptide release (Fig. 3). The absolute level
of capsaicin-stimulated iCGRP released when NGF was
omitted from the culture media was ⬃25% less than when
NGF was present (no added NGF: 97.39⫾10.42 fmol/well,
growth in 30 ng/mL NGF: 127.83⫾11.24 fmol/well). While

the amount of capsaicin-evoked release was enhanced by
10 ng/mL GDNF in both conditions, the absolute level of
iCGRP released was again ⬃25% less in the cells that
were not exposed to NGF (no added NGF: 162.54⫾8.45,
growth in 30 ng/mL NGF: 219.27⫾21.86 fmol/well). The
reduction in absolute levels of iCGRP released from sen-
sory neurons maintained in culture in the absence of
added NGF, but an absence of change in the percent of
the total content of iCGRP released is consistent with
previous observations (Park et al., 2006).

GFLs do not enhance the potassium-stimulated
release of iCGRP from isolated sensory neurons

Previous studies have focused primarily on GFL-induced
changes in response to capsaicin in isolated DRG neu-
rons. To determine whether responses to stimuli other than
capsaicin could be enhanced by GFLs, a general depolar-
izing stimulus, high extracellular potassium, was used.

Fig. 3. NGF in culture media does not change the stimulated release
of iCGRP and the GDNF-induced enhancement in release. Peptide
release elicited by a 10-min exposure to Hepes buffer alone (open
bars) or Hepes buffer containing 50 nM capsaicin (Cap; dark bars) is
expressed as mean percent total peptide content of cells in each
well⫾SEM (n⫽9 wells per condition). Ten nanograms/mL GDNF was
included in the 10 min prior to and throughout capsaicin exposure.
Total growth factor exposure time was 20 min. NGF was added in the
culture medium at a concentration of 30 ng/mL or omitted from the
culture medium. Asterisks (*) indicate statistically signiﬁcant differ-
ences in iCGRP release between GDNF treatment group and the no
GFL condition using an t-test (P⬍0.05). In all cases, release stimu-
lated by capsaicin was signiﬁcantly higher than basal release.

treatment with 100 ng/mL GDNF was unable to enhance

a well-established sensory neuronal sensitizing agent (Martin

hanced the potassium-stimulated release of iCGRP by nearly
twofold (Fig. 4; 14.3%⫾0.79%). These data suggest that
GDNF, NTN, and ART, unlike PGE2, sensitize sensory neu-
rons through an interaction with TRPV1 and not by mecha-
nisms independent of the stimulus type.

GFLs enhance the capsaicin-stimulated release of
iCGRP from spinal cord slices

Sensitization of the central terminals of primary sensory
neurons, which synapse onto second order neurons in the
spinal cord,
is also important during inﬂammation and
propagation of the pain signal. The GFR␣ receptors are
present on the central terminal of primary afferent neurons
(Josephson et al., 2001), and GFLs are released by astro-
cytes in the spinal cord (Nosrat et al., 1996; Nomura et al.,
2002). In order to examine the actions of GFLs in sensiti-
zation of the central terminals of sensory neurons, iCGRP
release from spinal cord slices was measured.

comparing capsaicin-stimulated release of iCGRP in the
absence or presence of 10 ng/mL GDNF. The fmol of

10 min prior to and throughout potassium exposure. PGE2 was present
in the basal and stimulated conditions at a concentration of 500 nM.
Total growth factor and PGE2 exposure time was 20 min. There were
no signiﬁcant differences in iCGRP release between treatment groups
and the no GFL condition. A signiﬁcant enhancement in iCGRP re-
lease was observed with PGE2 using ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc
test (P⬍0.05). In all cases, release stimulated by potassium was
signiﬁcantly higher than basal release.

iCGRP of 6.99%⫾1.06%. Treatment with GDNF, NTN, or

ulus period did not alter KCl-stimulated iCGRP release

by exposure to GDNF for 30 min prior to and throughout the
stimulus period (no GFL: 0.94⫾0.12%, 1.46⫾0.18%, and
1.28⫾0.15%; 10 ng/mL GDNF: 1.14⫾0.09%, 2.29⫾0.08%,
and 1.96⫾0.25%). The proﬁles of
increased release of
iCGRP were similar when the spinal cord slices were ex-
posed to NTN and ART (data not shown). Evoked release
was determined by subtracting the three basal fractions of
iCGRP release from the three capsaicin-stimulated fractions.
As demonstrated in Fig. 5B, GDNF, NTN, and ART all were
able to signiﬁcantly enhance the capsaicin-evoked release of
iCGRP from the spinal cord slices by two- to threefold (no
GFL: 2.50%⫾0.42%, GDNF 4.05%⫾0.43%, NTN: 6.18%⫾
0.28%, ART: 5.88%⫾1.94%). The total content of iCGRP per
mg of protein in the spinal cord slices was not changed by
exposure to GFLs (no GFL: 298.41⫾44.28 fmol/mg, GDNF:
275.46⫾25.13 fmol/mg, NTN: 220.71⫾84.84 fmol/mg, ART:
227.58⫾98.63 fmol/mg). These data indicate that the GFLs
are able to sensitize the central terminals of the sensory
neurons to capsaicin stimulation.

DISCUSSION

Previous studies have shown that the GFLs are potent
modulators of the TRPV1 channel and that injection of
these molecules induces hyperalgesia (Malin et al., 2006).
However, whether this TRPV1 modulation results in a
change in integrative functions of the sensory neurons,
such as neurotransmitter release, and whether this change
in function could be responsible for the GFL-induced hy-
peralgesia, is not clear. Here, direct evidence is provided,
from both neuronal cultures and freshly dissociated neu-
ronal tissues, that select GFLs sensitize sensory neurons,
resulting in increased stimulated-release of iCGRP. This
sensitization could be a contributing factor to the inﬂam-
matory hyperalgesia induced by GFLs.

Multiple GFLs were able to sensitize capsaicin-stimu-
lated release of iCGRP. The selected GFLs were able to
produce an enhancement in the capsaicin-stimulated re-
lease of iCGRP, not only in sensory neurons in culture but
also in spinal cord slices. GFL-induced enhancement in
the release of iCGRP from the spinal cord slices indicates
that GFLs sensitize the central terminal of the primary
sensory neurons, the terminal related to propagation of the
nociceptive signal. GFR␣1-3 are found throughout
the
CNS, and speciﬁcally in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord
(Josephson et al., 2001; Quartu et al., 2007). It is possible
that the GFLs are exerting their effects on the enhance-
ment of release of iCGRP in sensory neurons through
these GFR␣receptors at this location during inﬂammation.
There is direct evidence that CGRP is important in the
propagation of the pain signal, since hyperalgesia due to
both pancreatitis and inﬂammation induced by carra-
geenan is attenuated by a CGRP blocking antibody (Satoh
et al., 1992; Wick et al., 2006). The GFR␣ receptors exist
on motor neurons originating in the ventral horn of the
spinal cord (Homma et al., 2003) and these neurons also
can contain CGRP (Gibson et al., 1988; Kruger et al.,
1988). Since the ventral half of the spinal cord is also
present
in the preparation used in these experiments,

basal release levels of iCGRP in response to the GFLs
could reﬂect release from both the dorsal and ventral neu-
ronal terminals. However, motor neurons in the ventral
horn are unlikely to signiﬁcantly contribute to the stimu-
lated release of iCGRP because motor neurons do not
contain TRPV1 receptors (Lauria et al., 2006). Since
CGRP from the central terminal of primary sensory neu-
rons is important in propagation of the pain signal, modu-
lation of release at this site may be a critically important
component of pain processing and hyperalgesia.

These data add to the previous observation that
GDNF, NTN, and ART are able to alter TRPV1 function
directly (Malin et al., 2006). The modulation of TRPV1
channels has been observed with other sensitizers of sen-
sory neurons, such as NGF (Shu and Mendell, 1999; Zhu
and Oxford, 2007), which may provide some insight into
the cellular mechanisms of GFL-induced sensitization.
Speciﬁcally, the GFLs may sensitize sensory neurons by
altering properties of TRPV1, perhaps by increasing the
ion ﬂow through the channel or rapidly increasing the
membrane expression of TRPV1, similar to the mecha-
nisms of NGF-induced sensitization (Zhang et al., 2005;
Zhu and Oxford, 2007). Interestingly, at a concentration of
100 ng/mL, GDNF is unable to enhance the release of
iCGRP. When the sensory neurons are exposed to this
higher concentration of GDNF, compensatory pathways
could be activated, which could alter its actions. This is not
without precedence, since exposure of sensory neurons in
culture to 10 ng/mL GDNF, but not 100 ng/mL GDNF,
enhances the content and capsaicin-evoked release of
CGRP (Price et al., 2005).
the capsaicin
concentration response curve is U-shaped (Bertelsen et
al., 2003). Therefore, another possible mechanism for the
inability of 100 ng/mL GDNF to induce sensitization is that
the capsaicin concentration–response curve is shifted by
GDNF. This could mean that 1 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL GDNF
are at the peak of this curve, while 100 ng/mL is on the
downward slopping portion of the curve.

Interestingly,

Long term exposure to growth factors, speciﬁcally
NGF, can change several properties of sensory neurons.
NGF increases the amount of CGRP produced (Maclean
et al., 1989; Sango et al., 1994) and the expression and
membrane insertion of TRPV1 (Xue et al., 2007; Stein et
al., 2006). These changes could affect the responses of
sensory neurons to GFL-induced sensitization. However,
while the absolute amount of iCGRP present and iCGRP
released upon stimulation was reduced when the cultures
lacked NGF, the sensitization proﬁle of GFLs was unaf-
fected (Fig. 3). This observation indicates that the NGF
present in the cultures did not alter the sensitization phe-
notype of the sensory neuron, which is in line with previous
studies (Park et al., 2006). In addition, when spinal cord
tissue was exposed to the GFLs, there was a similar proﬁle
of enhanced release of iCGRP to that seen with isolated
sensory neurons in culture (Fig. 5). Since this spinal cord
tissue is freshly dissociated, and the responses of this
tissue and the isolated sensory neurons in culture were
identical, it is unlikely that the phenotype of the sensory
neurons is changed by maintenance in culture.

While GDNF, NTN, and ART were able to sensitize
capsaicin-stimulated release robustly, potassium-stimu-
lated release was not enhanced by any of the GFLs. This
is in contrast to previous observations in the trigeminal
ganglia (TG) and neurons from transgenic mice (Price et
al., 2005; Albers et al., 2006). The majority of previous
studies have examined the role of GFLs in capsaicin-
induced sensory neuronal changes. However, studies con-
ducted on neurons from TG and transgenic mice have
demonstrated that GDNF is able to alter the sensitivity of
sensory neurons in ways other than through TRPV1. Po-
tassium-stimulated release of CGRP from sensory neu-
rons in the TG was sensitized by GDNF (Price et al., 2005).
There could be critical physiological differences between
the responses evoked in the TG and the DRG, which could
be responsible for the observed differences in our studies.
In fact, large differences exist between TG neurons and
DRG neurons in the levels of CGRP, TRPV1, and isolectin
B4 (IB4), as well as the co-localization of these proteins
within the ganglia (Price and Flores, 2007). IB4 neurons
are generally considered GDNF-responsive neurons
(Kashiba et al., 2001). A much higher percentage of neu-
rons in the DRG express both IB4 and TRPV1 than in the
TG (Price and Flores, 2007), which may be one contribut-
ing factor to the differential responses seen with tissue
from these two types of ganglia. Albers et al. (2006) used
transgenic mice that over-expressed GDNF (GDNF-OE) in
the skin and found that neurons from these mice exhibited
enhanced electrical responses to mechanical stimuli. Me-
chanical hyperalgesia was also present in these GDNF-OE
mice. The difference between the responses of the sen-
sory neurons to the general stimulus (potassium) used in
our studies and the results of studies conducted on the
GDNF-OE mice described above could be the result of
several
the amount of overlap between
mechano-sensitive neurons and different TRP receptors is
unclear (Lawson et al., 2008; Tender et al., 2008), which
may mean that some of the mechanical hyperalgesia seen
in these GDNF-OE mice is TRP-mediated. Since GDNF is
necessary for the development of sensory neurons, the
use of GDNF-OE mice may change certain properties of
the neurons, thereby making them more likely to be sen-
sitized to more types of stimuli by GFLs. What remains
clear is that the GFLs sensitize sensory neurons through
the TRPV1 channel. The mechanisms of this alteration in
the TRPV1 channel, perhaps by changes in phosphoryla-
tion states of the channel, is not yet known and requires
further investigation.

factors. First,

Unlike the other GFLs, PSP did not alter the capsaicin-
stimulated release of iCGRP. Neurite outgrowth in adult
DRG cultures, which can be efﬁciently induced by GDNF,
NTN, and ART, is not caused by PSP (Lindahl et al., 2000;
Paveliev et al., 2004). This inability of PSP to induce an
enhancement
in the capsaicin-stimulated release of
iCGRP supports the current theory that adult mammalian
sensory neurons are unresponsive to PSP. Even at con-
centrations as high as 500 ng/mL, PSP could not enhance
the release of iCGRP. The use of these higher concentra-
tions was necessary because the Kd value of PSP for its

receptor, GFR␣4 is⬃6 mM ( Enokido et al., 1998) which is
much higher than the other GFLs for their preferred GFR␣
receptors (0.6 and 1 mM; Baloh et al., 1997; Klein et al.,
1997; Trupp et al., 1998). Since PSP is not able to induce
sensory neuronal sensitization at these high concentra-
tions, it is unlikely to have signiﬁcant binding or actions on
the other GFR␣ receptors in our system.

We have demonstrated that the GFLs, GDNF, NTN,
and ART, are sensitizers of neuropeptide release from
sensory neurons. The level of enhancement of iCGRP
release by the GFLs is similar to that produced in DRGs
and TG by NGF, both in CGRP levels normalized to per-
cent content and absolute levels of CGRP released (Hingt-
gen et al., 2006; Price et al., 2005). Additionally, inﬂam-
mation, induced by an injection of a mixture of inﬂamma-
tory mediators, noxious heat, and acidic shifts in pH
enhanced the release of CGRP to similar levels as the
GFLs (Eberhardt et al., 2008). The actions of the GFLs are
speciﬁc to activation with capsaicin suggesting that the
GFLs may induce sensitization through TRPV1-speciﬁc
mechanisms. Since the levels of GFLs are greatly en-
hanced during inﬂammation, directly alter TRPV1 channel
properties, and induce thermal hyperalgesia upon injec-
tion, they are clearly important mediators of sensory neu-
ronal function. The cellular mechanisms responsible for
this enhancement in release are not known. A number of
candidate pathways exist, including the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-
3K) pathways, since these pathways are activated by
GFLs (Bron et al., 2003) and are known to be associated
with sensory neuronal sensitization (Zhuang et al., 2004).
Additionally, Ret-independent pathways may play a role in
this sensitization. The Ret-independent pathways, initiated
by integrin ␤1 and/or neural cell adhesion molecule, are a
novel set of pathways induced by GFLs in sensory neurons
(Cao et al., 2008a,b). It may be important to evaluate the
role of these Ret-dependent and Ret-independent path-
ways in the GFL-induced sensory neuronal sensitization,
as well as to determine how these pathways are speciﬁ-
cally modulating TRPV1 channel function. With the GFL-
induced increases in peptide release demonstrated here,
we have provided a connection between the modulation of
TRPV1 by GFLs and the hyperalgesia associated with the
release of GFLs during inﬂammation.
