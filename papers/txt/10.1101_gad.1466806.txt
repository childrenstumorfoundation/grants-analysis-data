Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is among the most common genetic disorders of humans and is caused by loss
of neurofibromin, a large and highly conserved protein whose only known function is to serve as a
GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP) for Ras. However, most Drosophila NF1 mutant phenotypes, including an
overall growth deficiency, are not readily modified by manipulating Ras signaling strength, but are rescued by
increasing signaling through the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway. This has led to suggestions that
NF1 has distinct Ras- and cAMP-related functions. Here we report that the Drosophila NF1 growth defect
reflects a non-cell-autonomous requirement for NF1 in larval neurons that express the R-Ras ortholog Ras2,
that NF1 is a GAP for Ras1 and Ras2, and that a functional NF1-GAP catalytic domain is both necessary and
sufficient for rescue. Moreover, a Drosophila p120RasGAP ortholog, when expressed in the appropriate cells,
can substitute for NF1 in growth regulation. Our results show that loss of NF1 can give rise to
non-cell-autonomous developmental defects, implicate aberrant Ras-mediated signaling in larval neurons as
the primary cause of the NF1 growth deficiency, and argue against the notion that neurofibromin has
separable Ras- and cAMP-related functions.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, OMIM 162200) is a com-
mon genetic disorder, affecting two to three per 10,000
live births worldwide (Huson and Hughes 1994). NF1
patients are predisposed toward developing a variety of
defects, the most characteristic of which include areas of
abnormal skin pigmentation and benign tumors associ-
ated with peripheral nerves, termed neurofibromas. Less
universal but more serious symptoms also include ma-
lignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, other malignan-
cies, and learning disabilities. Developmental abnor-
malities, such as specific skeletal defects, macrocephaly,

and short stature, are also associated with NF1 (Huson
and Hughes 1994). The >2800-amino-acid NF1 protein,
termed neurofibromin, includes a segment related to the
catalytic domains of Ras-specific GTPase-Activating
Proteins (GAPs), and ample evidence supports the notion
that the ability of neurofibromin to inactivate Ras plays
a critical role in the development of NF1-associated tu-
mors (Cichowski and Jacks 2001). The GAP-related do-
main (GRD) constitutes only ∼15% of neurofibromin,
however, and it is less clear whether Ras signaling de-
fects are also the immediate cause of other disease symp-
toms.

A Drosophila melanogaster NF1 ortholog predicts a
protein that is ∼60% identical to human neurofibromin
over its entire length. We previously reported that Dro-
sophila NF1-null mutants are viable, fertile, and nor-
mally patterned, but display a 15%–20% reduction in
linear dimensions during all stages of post-embryonic

development (The et al. 1997). NF1 mutants also lack a
neuropeptide-stimulated K+ current at the neuromuscu-
lar junction (Guo et al. 1997), have a defective escape
response (The et al. 1997), display an olfactory learning
deficit (Guo et al. 2000), and lack a circadian rest–activ-
ity rhythm (Williams et al. 2001). The circadian defect is
partially restored by mutations that attenuate Ras sig-
naling (Williams et al. 2001). However, all other ana-
lyzed phenotypes lack dosage-sensitive genetic interac-
tions with mutations that alter Ras signaling strength.
These Ras-insensitive NF1 phenotypes, however, are
suppressed by increasing and enhanced or mimicked by
decreasing the activity of the cAMP/PKA signaling path-
way (Guo et al. 1997, 2000; The et al. 1997). A functional
link between NF1 and cAMP/PKA signaling is further
supported by the detection of a reduced cAMP level in
Nf1−/− versus Nf1+/− mouse embryos, and by reports of
cAMP signaling defects in NF1-deficient fly brain ex-
tracts (Tong et al. 2002; Hannan et al. 2006). Arguing
that any cAMP/PKA-related function may be evolution-
arily conserved, expression of human neurofibromin res-
cued the Drosophila mutant size defect (Tong et al.
2002).

The only known enzymatic activity of neurofibromin
is the ability of its GRD to stimulate the GTPase activity
of Ras (Cichowski and Jacks 2001). However, studies in
Drosophila and in mammalian cells (Dasgupta et al.
2003) have led to suggestions that neurofibromin may
also affect cAMP/PKA signaling, potentially indepen-
dent of its role as a Ras regulator (Hannan et al. 2006). It
is therefore important to determine whether the growth-
regulating properties of Drosophila NF1 are separable
from its function as a GAP for Ras family GTPases.

In this study, we investigated the cellular and molecu-
lar basis of the NF1 size defect. We demonstrate that
NF1 function in specific neurons of the larval CNS ac-
counts for its ability to regulate organismal growth. We
also demonstrate that this function of NF1 is inseparable
from its function as a GAP for Ras family GTPases, ar-
guing against the notion that NF1 has separate Ras- and
cAMP-regulating functions. Our studies also implicate
the R-Ras ortholog, Ras2, in the pathway by which NF1
regulates growth.

Results

Characterization of new NF1 mutants

NF1 alleles used in all previous studies were generated
by mobilizing a P transposon in a nonisogenic fly strain.
Of these original alleles, NF1P1 represented a deletion of
most of the NF1 coding region and of at least two genes
in the adjacent Enhancer-of-split complex, whereas in
NF1P2, a duplicate transposon located in the first NF1
intron interrupted its expression (The et al. 1997). Given
that Drosophila NF1 phenotypes are quantitative defects
that might be sensitive to genetic background differ-
ences, neither allele was ideal for genetic studies. Thus,
we used a chromosome 2 and 3 isogenized stock to con-
duct an F1 screen for ethyl methane sulfonate-induced

mutations that failed to complement the NF1 small pupa
phenotype. Screening 30,000 pupae yielded three new
NF1 alleles. NF1E1 and NF1E2 have nonsense mutations
upstream of the catalytic GRD, truncating the protein
after 1061 and 369 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1A).
NF1E4 is a C1045Y missense mutation in a conserved
part of neurofibromin that also harbors two disease-as-
sociated missense mutations (Wu et al. 1996; Kluwe et

al. 2003). In sequential immunoprecipitation immuno-
blot (IP-Western) experiments, using monoclonal anti-
bodies generated against a C-terminal protein segment
(The et al. 1997), no NF1 protein was detected in NF1E1
or NF1E2 lysates, whereas NF1E4 and wild-type protein
levels were indistinguishable (data not shown).

Similar to NF1P1 or NF1P2 (The et al. 1997), NF1E1 or
NF1E2 pupae are 15%–20% smaller than isogenic wild-
type pupae. The NF1E4 missense mutant in this respect
behaves as a temperature-sensitive hypomorph (Fig. 1C).
Of special relevance to the human disease, several hap-
loinsufficient phenotypes have been described in NF1+/−
mammalian cells (Zhu et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2005;
Hingtgen et al. 2006). Drosophila NF1 also appears hap-
loinsufficient for growth regulation, since both male and
female NF1E1/+ or NF1E2/+ pupae exhibited a small
(∼4%), but highly significant (Student t-test p < 0.0001;
n = 45) reduction in length compared with isogenic con-
trols (data not shown). The surface area of NF1E1, NF1E2,
or NF1E1/NF1E2 adult wings was ∼30%–40% smaller
than wings of the parental stock (Fig. 1D). As inferred
from the density of wing hairs, this reduction largely
reflects a reduction in cell size (data not shown). Wing
imaginal discs were similarly reduced in size and made
up of smaller cells (Fig. 1E). However, the fraction of
wing disc cells in the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell
cycle did not differ appreciably from controls, indicating
a proportional reduction in growth during all phases of
the cell cycle (Fig. 1F).

NF1 non-cell-autonomous growth control

NF1 is expressed in post-mitotic larval brain neurons

Previously, NF1−/− epidermal cells generated in the
wings of heterozygous animals were found to be of wild-
type size, providing the first indication that the require-
ment for NF1 in regulating growth might be non-cell-
autonomous (The et al. 1997). Such nonautonomy could
indicate a requirement for NF1 either in cells immedi-
ately adjacent to mutant cells, or in more distant cells—
possibly even in a different tissue.

Most insect growth occurs during larval development,
and the reduced growth of NF1 mutants first becomes
apparent during this phase of the life cycle (The et al.
1997). Immunostaining of dissected wild-type larvae de-
tected little, if any, above background staining in most
tissues, including fat body, gut, epidermis or the imagi-
nal discs. The ring gland also lacked obvious staining,
which together with other findings argues against a
growth-related role for NF1 in this neuroendocrine gland
(see below). In contrast, prominent staining was detected
in the CNS of wild-type, but not of NF1E1 or NF1E2,
larvae. In the CNS of first, second, or third instar larvae,
anti-NF1 staining was widespread but not ubiquitous
(Fig. 2A–F). In third instar CNS, staining was prominent
in the central brain region and in parts of the ventral
ganglion, but was low or absent in the proliferative zones
of the optic lobes, as witnessed by the lack of overlap
between BrdU and NF1 staining (Fig. 2G). Confocal mi-
croscopy of third instar CNS revealed complex patterns

of intermingled NF1-expressing and -nonexpressing cells
(Fig. 2H,I). A lack of overlap between endogenous NF1
expression and UAS-GFP expression driven by the re-
versed polarity (repo) glial cell GAL4 driver argues that
NF1-expressing cells do not represent the glial lineage
(Fig. 2J–L). A lack of overlap between endogenous NF1
and grainyhead-driven LacZ expression (Almeida and
Bray 2005) similarly argues that NF1-expressing cells are
not neuroblasts (Fig. 2M–O). Substantial overlap was
observed between endogenous NF1 and elav-GAL4-
driven UAS-GFP expression, supporting the notion that
NF1-expressing cells are mature neurons (data not
shown). Finally, since adult NF1 flies exhibit defec-
tive olfactory learning (Guo et al. 2000), and since mush-
room bodies (MBs) are neuronal structures implicated in
olfactory learning (Skoulakis et al. 1993), it is interesting
to note that no obvious NF1 staining was apparent in
third instar (Fig. 2P–R) or adult fly brain MBs (data not
shown).

NF1 functions in larval neurons to regulate growth
non-cell-autonomously

To examine whether NF1 functions in larval neurons to
regulate overall organismal growth, we expressed a Dro-
sophila UAS-NF1 transgene in defined larval tissues
(Brand and Perrimon 1993). We first analyzed whether
expression in wing imaginal discs under the control of
the engrailed-GAL4 (en-GAL4) or in larval neurons
under the control of the pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 driver
was sufficient to rescue the size defect. Staining of third
instar imaginal discs and CNS produced the expected
patterns of en-GAL4-driven UAS-NF1 expression, re-
stricted to the posterior half of wing discs (Neufeld et al.
1998) and to serotonergic neurons (Lundell et al. 1996)
in the CNS (Supplementary Fig. 1). This expression pat-
tern was insufficient to rescue NF1E1/E2 pupal or adult
wing size defects (Table 1). Moreover, there was no dif-
ference in the relative size of anterior and posterior adult
wing compartments, indicating that NF1 expression in a
significant portion of the wing disc was unable to affect
disc growth. In contrast, elav-GAL4-driven neuronal ex-

pression of UAS-NF1 strongly rescued the reduced pupal
size phenotype as well as adult wing size defects (Ta-
ble 1).

As expected, elav-GAL4-driven UAS-NF1 expression
was widespread throughout the larval CNS, but low-
level staining was also apparent in the part of the wing
disc that gives rise to the wing hinge (Supplementary Fig.
1). Thus, to examine in more detail which tissues or cells
require NF1 to support normal growth, we analyzed the
rescuing ability of >100 additional GAL4 drivers. For
many drivers, we analyzed overall pupal size and adult
wing size in parallel with their larval expression pattern,
the latter either by staining UAS-NF1 transgenics with
NF1 antibodies or by using a UAS-GFP reporter. Drivers
that express in the fat body, salivary glands, gut, imagi-
nal discs, lymph gland, or epidermis did not rescue the
growth defects (Supplementary Table 1). The common
denominator among 16 drivers that did significantly res-
cue was different degrees of expression in the larval CNS
(Supplementary Table 1). Expression of UAS-NF1 di-
rected by repo-GAL4 did not modify NF1 size, arguing
against a role for glial cells. Several subsets of neurons
can similarly be ruled out as uniquely responsible. It was
shown recently that increased Ras signaling in the ecdy-
sone-producing prothoracic gland, which is part of the
neuroendocrine ring gland, reduces the overall size of
Drosophila (Caldwell et al. 2005; Colombani et al. 2005;
Mirth et al. 2005). However, UAS-NF1 expression con-
trolled by the Phantom-GAL4, Aug 21, or P0206-GAL4
ring gland drivers did not rescue the NF1 size defect
(Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, Feb 211-, Mai 301-,
or Mai 369-driven UAS-NF1 expression in subsets of
neurons that innervate the ring gland (Siegmund and
Korge 2001) did not restore normal growth. Among the
drivers expressed in peptidergic neurons, only the rela-
tively widely expressed GAL4-386Y driver (Taghert et al.
2001) allowed partial rescue. No rescue was observed
upon expressing UAS-NF1 in dopaminergic neurons us-
ing two Ddc-GAL4 drivers (Li et al. 2000), in cholinergic
neurons using Cha-GAL4 19B (Salvaterra and Kitamoto
2001), in amnesiac-expressing cells using the amnc651
driver (Waddell et al. 2000), or in insulin-producing neu-

rosecretory cells using dILP2-GAL4 (Rulifson et al.
2002).

In summary, our experiments demonstrate a role for
NF1 in the larval brain to regulate the growth of larval
tissues, including wing imaginal discs. Moreover, since
NF1 expression in neuronal subpopulations previously
implicated in nonautonomous growth control does not
restore mutant growth, our findings imply a role for
other portions of the larval brain in regulating organis-
mal growth. We have further localized this function to
cells in the brain that express the Ras family GTPase
Ras2 (see below).

Loss of NF1 enhances CNS MEK/ERK activity,
without causing obvious changes in proliferation
or differentiation

Since the only established biochemical function of neu-
rofibromin is its ability to act as a GAP for Ras
(Cichowski and Jacks 2001), we analyzed NF1-deficient
third instar larval CNS and adult fly heads for Ras sig-
naling defects. Extending a previous finding (Williams et
al. 2001), and consistent with a role as a negative regu-
lator of the Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK cascade, we detected a
reproducible two- to fourfold increase in the level of
phosphorylated rl ERK kinase (hereafter referred to as
p-ERK) in NF1 third instar larval CNS extracts (Fig. 3A,
lanes 1,2). Elevated p-ERK was also apparent in adult
NF1 fly heads (Fig. 3A, lanes 3,4) but not in wing discs
(Fig. 3B). The kinase acting upstream of ERK, Dsor1,
showed a similar increase in phosphorylation (Fig. 3A).
In contrast, using an assay that detected elevated phos-
pho-Akt1 (p-Akt1) in flies expressing activated Ras1 (Co-
lombani et al. 2005), we observed no change in p-Akt1
levels between NF1 and wild-type larval or adult CNS
(Fig. 3A). Arguing that loss of NF1 causes no major de-
fects in cell proliferation or differentiation, confocal
analysis of BrdU-stained wild-type and mutant larval
CNS revealed no obvious differences in the number or
localization of proliferating cells, and expression of sev-
eral differentiation markers also appeared unchanged
(data not shown). Interestingly, anti-NF1 and anti-p-ERK
staining overlapped extensively in wild-type CNS
(Supplementary Fig. 2A–F). Loss of NF1 increased the
intensity of p-ERK staining, but not its pattern (data not
shown).

Neuronal expression of a functional NF1GRD
is necessary and sufficient for size rescue

Ubiquitous or neuronal UAS-NF1 expression rescued
NF1 pupal size, whereas glial expression did not (Fig.
3C). Size rescue correlates with suppression of the el-
evated third instar CNS p-ERK phenotype (Fig. 3D,E).
Taken together, these findings are consistent with NF1
functioning as a GAP for a Ras family GTPase in specific
parts of the brain to regulate growth. However, it has
been suggested that the NF1 protein may have functions
independent of its RasGAP activity, and these may be

required for its ability to regulate organismal growth
(Hannan et al. 2006). To distinguish between these pos-
sibilities, we tested whether the catalytic GRD was re-
quired for size rescue, and whether other protein seg-
ments were also essential.

mately half its length. The Ira-related segment includes

tative lipid-binding domain (Aravind et al. 1999;
D’Angelo et al. 2006). To determine which parts of neu-
rofibromin are essential for rescuing the size defect, we
generated heat-shock-inducible Drosophila NF1 trans-
genes bearing in-frame deletions (Fig. 4A). Flies express-
ing these transgenes were crossed into the NF1E2 back-
ground and at least two transgenic lines expressing simi-
lar protein levels were analyzed for each construct (Fig.
4B).

We previously described two Drosophila NF1 splice
forms with different C termini and reported that expres-
sion of the shorter protein restored NF1 mutant growth
(The et al. 1997). Subsequent analysis revealed that the
rescuing transgene also lacked alternatively spliced exon
14, coding for amino acids 2548–2577. Interestingly, the
position of Drosophila NF1 exon 14 corresponds almost
exactly to where exon 43 is alternatively spliced in hu-

man NF1 (Vandenbroucke et al. 2002). However, a
hsp70-NF12802 transgene that included exon 14 and the
longer C-terminal exon rescued pupal size to the same
extent as the original hsp70-NF12734 transgene (data not
shown). Thus, alternative splicing of C-terminal exons
does not affect size rescue.

Surprisingly, deletions that remove large parts of neu-
rofibromin other than the GRD were able to rescue the
size defect (Fig. 4C). These included a number of protein
segments that are highly conserved between Drosophila
and human NF1. The Sec14 domain, which was recently
suggested to harbor three potential caveolin-binding
sites (Boyanapalli et al. 2006), is entirely dispensable for
size rescue. The ⌬1770–2265 mutant, which lacks most
of the remainder of the C-terminal Ira-related segment,
including a recently described pleckstrin-like domain,
also rescued the size defect—albeit that efficient rescue
required transgene homozygosity. A large proportion of
disease-associated NF1 missense mutations occur in a
region upstream of the Ira-related segment, suggesting
the existence of a second functional domain (Fahsold et
al. 2000; Mattocks et al. 2004). However, the ⌬492–1092
mutant, engineered to remove the region corresponding
to this upstream mutation cluster, also rescued. In con-
trast, the ⌬1219–1580 GRD deletion mutant was ex-
pressed, but did not rescue growth (Fig. 4).

Since the GRD appears necessary for rescue, we next
analyzed whether GAP activity was required. To this
end we generated flies expressing four transgenes harbor-
ing single amino acid substitutions predicted to interfere
with GAP activity. In two mutants, the catalytically es-
sential Arg 1320 in the GRD finger loop (Scheffzek et al.
1997) was substituted for either a proline or an alanine.
The corresponding human R1276P and R1276A mutants
have >1000-fold reduced GAP activity (Klose et al. 1998;
Sermon et al. 1998). In a third mutant, Gln 1471 in the
␣7/variable loop of the GRD was substituted for an ar-
ginine. The corresponding Q1426R human mutant be-
haves as a loss-of-function mutant in a yeast Ira comple-
mentation assay (Gutmann et al. 1993). Finally, to ad-
dress the concern that catalytically impaired mutants
might attenuate Ras signaling by sequestering the
GTPase, we also generated a K1481A mutant. Lys 1481
does not map near the catalytic site, but undergoes elec-
trostatic interactions with charged residues in the
switch 1 region of Ras (Scheffzek et al. 1997). The corre-
sponding K1436A human neurofibromin mutant had 96-
fold reduced affinity for Ras, but near normal catalytic
activity at saturation (Ahmadian et al. 2003). All mutant
proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 5B), but
only the catalytically active K1481A mutant rescued pu-
pal size and third instar CNS p-ERK levels (Fig. 5A,C,D).
Since GAP activity appears essential for rescue, we
next asked whether expression of a truncated NF1GRD
protein was sufficient. We also tested four NF1GRD con-
structs bearing R1320A, R1320P, K1468T, and K1481A
mutations. K1468T was the only mutant not tested in
the context of a full-length transgene. K1468 corresponds
to human NF1 K1423, implicated as important for GAP
activity and microtubule association of neurofibromin

(Poullet et al. 1994; Xu and Gutmann 1997). All proteins
were expressed at similar levels when driven by Act5C-
GAL4 (Fig. 5E). Demonstrating that the NF1GRD is suf-
ficient for rescue, the wild-type protein strongly rescued
pupal size. Significant rescue was also observed when
the wild-type protein was expressed in neurons using
c23-GAL4, but not upon expression in glial cells using
repo-GAL4 (Fig. 5F). Three of four GRD missense mu-
tants failed to rescue size or p-ERK phenotypes, either
when expressed in neurons or ubiquitously. Similar to
the full-length K1481A transgene, the K1481A NF1GRD
mutant rescued both phenotypes partially (Fig. 5F–H).
Thus, expression of a functional NF1-GAP catalytic do-
main is both necessary and sufficient to restore normal
growth.

NF1 expression in Ras2-expressing cells rescues size
and ERK activation defects

Expression of a functional NF1GRD is necessary and suf-
ficient for size rescue, yet in previous studies several Ras
pathway mutants did not dominantly modify NF1 size
(The et al. 1997; Williams et al. 2001). This raised the
possibility that NF1 could also act as a GAP for other
Ras-like GTPases and that this role for NF1 might be
important in its ability to regulate growth. Human NF1
is a GAP for H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras, and for all three

R-Ras paralogs (Rey et al. 1994; Ohba et al. 2000; Huang
et al. 2004). In Drosophila, Ras1 is orthologous to H-Ras,
K-Ras, and N-Ras, whereas Ras2 is most similar to mam-
malian R-Ras paralogs. In biochemical GAP activity as-
says, a bacterially produced Drosophila NF1GRD pro-
tein strongly enhanced GTP hydrolysis by Drosophila
Ras1 and Ras2, but not by Rap1, Rap2L, Rala, or Rheb
(Fig. 6A).

A failure to isolate mutants in a large F2 lethal screen
previously suggested that loss of Drosophila Ras2 might
not be lethal (Harrison et al. 1995). Ras2 is expressed
from a promoter that also controls the expression of the
SEC1-related Ras opposite , orRop, gene (Salzberg et al.
1993). Ras2/Rop promoter-driven LacZ expression was
previously detected in third instar CNS (Salzberg et al.
1993), in a pattern resembling the NF1 expression pat-
tern. Thus, to determine whether expression of UAS-
NF1 in Ras2-expressing cells suffices to rescue, we gen-
erated transgenic lines expressing GAL4 under the con-
trol of the Ras2/Rop promoter. Among two Ras2-GAL4
lines used, Ras2-GAL4(41) gives rise to high levels of
UAS-GFP expression in salivary glands, in the gut, and
in a specific pattern within the central brain region and
the ventral ganglion of the larval CNS, consistent with
previous results (Salzberg et al. 1993). The Ras2-
GAL4(12) line drove expression in essentially the same
pattern, but at a lower level. The third instar CNS Ras2-

expected, Ras1-GAL4 drivers caused widespread UAS-
GFP expression throughout development, but in third
instar CNS, expression appeared especially high in the

ring gland, whereas the Ras2 driver was not detectably
expressed in this tissue (Fig. 6B). Expression of UAS-NF1
or UAS-NF1GRD transgenes directed by the strong but
not the weak Ras2-GAL4 driver potently rescued the
size defect, suggesting that that the NF1 size defect re-
flects a function for neurofibromin in Ras2-expressing
cells. Not unexpectedly, rescue was also observed when
UAS-NF1 was driven with the widespread Ras1-GAL4
driver (Fig. 6C). Compatible with the notion that el-
evated Ras activity in Ras2-expressing cells contributes
to the NF1 size defect, expression of either UAS-
Ras1Val12 or UAS-Ras2Val14 under the control of the
weak Ras2-GAL4(12) driver resulted in small dead pupae
when cultures were maintained at 25°C or 18°C,
whereas flies that eclosed at 16°C phenocopied the NF1
size defect. Expression of a gain-of-function Raf mutant
in Ras2-expressing cells similarly phenocopied the NF1
size defect (Fig. 6D; Supplementary Table 2). Taken to-
gether, these results imply that the level of Ras pathway
signaling in Ras2-expressing cells is important in regu-
lating organismal size.

Dosage-sensitive genetic suppression of NF1
phenotypes by Ras pathway mutants

Previously, we showed that two Ras1 loss-of-function
alleles did not dominantly modify NF1 size phenotypes
(The et al. 1997). It is possible, however, that heterozy-
gous loss of Ras1 is insufficient to restore normal signal-
ing in an NF1-null mutant background. Thus, we ana-
lyzed modification of pupal size and larval p-ERK phe-
notypes using multiple single- and double-mutant
combinations in both NF1E2-null and NF1E4 hypomor-
phic mutants. Heterozygous loss of Ras1 or of Ras2 [us-
ing Df(3L)GN34 and Df(3L)GN19, which uncover Ras2],
or combined loss of Ras1 and Ras2 was insufficient to
modify pupal size or larval p-ERK phenotypes of either
NF1E2 (Fig. 6E,F) or NF1E4 (data not shown). All tested
single mutants affecting canonical Ras effectors simi-
larly did not modify NF1 pupal size. Tested mutants in-
clude alleles of RalGDS ortholog Rgl, its target GTPase
Rala, and PI3K21B, encoding the p60 regulatory subunit
of Drosophila class 1 PI3 kinase. No modification of NF1
size was observed upon Ras2-GAL4(41)-driven expres-
sion of a UAS-Dp110D954A dominant-negative PI3 ki-
nase transgene (Leevers et al. 1996), and Ras2-GAL4(41)-
driven expression of a constitutively active UAS-
Dp110CAAX transgene did not phenocopy NF1 size (data
not shown). Similarly, Ras2-GAL4(41)-driven expression
of either dominant-negative Ras1 or dominant-negative
Raf did not rescue NF1 size phenotypes. The mTor path-
way is activated in NF1-deficient mammalian cells (Das-
gupta et al. 2005; Johannessen et al. 2005), but two Tor
alleles did not modify size. Loss-of-function mutants af-
fecting raf, Dsor1, and rl—components of the canonical
Raf–MEK–ERK cascade—also did not modify (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). However, combined heterozygous loss of
raf and rl, Ras1 and raf, orRas2 and raf fully rescued the
larval CNS p-ERK phenotype (Fig. 6F), while the former
two double-mutant combinations also rescued pupal

NF1 non-cell-autonomous growth control

size, but only partially (Fig. 6E). These observations in-
dicate that reducing Ras pathway signaling to achieve a
wild-type level of ERK activation is in itself insufficient
to rescue the pupal size phenotype. This suggests that
other effector mechanisms may be even more sensitive
to the levels or to the kinetics of Ras pathway activation.
If unregulated signaling through one or more Ras1
and/or Ras2 effectors explains the NF1 size defect, other
Drosophila RasGAPs that differ considerably from NF1
outside the GRD could potentially substitute for NF1.
Thus, we analyzed whether expression of p120RasGAP
ortholog RasGAP (Feldmann et al. 1999) or Gap1 (Gaul
et al. 1992) modified NF1 size. As shown in Figure 6, G
and H, elav-GAL4 or Ras2-GAL4(41), but not repo-
GAL4-driven UAS-RasGAP expression suppressed the
NF1 size defect, whereas Act5C-GAL4-driven expression
also suppressed the elevated larval CNS p-ERK level. In-
terestingly, expression of Gap1EP45 (Rorth 1996) did not
rescue either defect, even though GMR-GAL4-driven
Gap1EP45 expression gave rise to the previously charac-
terized (Rorth 1996) Ras1-dependent rough eye defect
(data not shown). The inability of Gap1EP45 to rescue
does not appear to reflect insufficient expression, since
identical results were obtained with transgenic lines ex-
pressing a GAL4-inducible Gap1 transgene, specifically
generated for this purpose. Similar to Gap1EP45, eye-spe-
cific expression of UAS-Gap1 caused rough eye pheno-
types, whereas ubiquitous expression was lethal. Neuro-
nal expression driven by elav-GAL4 or Ras2-Gal4(41)
was not lethal, but did not rescue NF1 size or p-ERK
defects (Fig. 6G,H). Thus, rescue of size and p-ERK phe-
notypes appears to reflect a property shared between
Drosophila NF1 and RasGAP, but not Gap1.

Discussion

Enhancing the GTPase activity of Ras family members is
the only known biochemical activity of neurofibromin,
the protein defective in patients with NF1 (Cichowski
and Jacks 2001). This has focused much attention on
manipulating Ras signaling as a way to correct the di-
verse symptoms of NF1. However, most Drosophila NF1
phenotypes lack dosage-sensitive genetic interactions
with mutants that affect signaling by Ras1, the single fly
ortholog of mammalian H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras.
Rather, an NF1 mutant growth deficiency, an electro-
physiological defect, and a defect in olfactory learning
are rescued by manipulations that increase signaling
through the cAMP/PKA pathway (Guo et al. 1997, 2000;
The et al. 1997). These findings have led to suggestions
that neurofibromin may affect cAMP/PKA signaling in a
Ras-independent manner, a hypothesis supported by a
recent report that human NF1 suppresses Drosophila
NF1 mutant size independent of GAP activity (Hannan
et al. 2006). In contrast, our experiments using Dro-
sophila NF1 transgenes suggest that loss of RasGAP ac-
tivity is inseparable from the NF1 size defect. The reason
for this discrepancy remains unclear, but may reflect in-
appropriate interactions between human neurofibromin

and Drosophila GTPases or other proteins involved in
growth regulation.

Our results show that the impaired growth of Dro-
sophila mutants reflects a non-cell-autonomous role for
NF1 in larval neurons. While runting is relatively com-
mon in mutant mice, we note that mice engineered to
specifically lack neuronal Nf1 expression were previ-
ously also found to be small (Zhu et al. 2001). Growth in
Drosophila proceeds during three larval instars that cul-
minate in pupariation, pupation, and adult eclosion. As
in other animals, growth is affected by feeding, which in
Drosophila occurs during the first two and most of the
third larval instar. Early in the third instar, larvae reach
what is known as critical weight, a point at which holo-
metabolous insects commit to metamorphosis and can
develop without further feeding (Beadle et al. 1938; Davi-
dowitz et al. 2003). Two neuroendocrine pathways have
been implicated in coordinating feeding with Drosophila
development and overall growth, but our results argue
against obvious roles for NF1 in either one. Perhaps the
best-understood growth-related pathway involves Dro-
sophila insulin-like proteins (dILPs), three of which are
produced—two in a nutrient-dependent manner—by bi-
lateral symmetric groups of seven neurosecretory cells in
the pars intercerebralis of the larval CNS (Ikeya et al.
2002). Ablating these cells causes a severe growth defect
that is rescued by expression of a dILP2 transgene (Ru-
lifson et al. 2002). In peripheral tissues, dILPs activate
the insulin receptor, leading to the phosphorylation of
CHICO and the recruitment of a class I PI3 kinase, con-
sisting of Dp110 catalytic and p60 regulatory subunits.
Genetic manipulations that increase signaling through
this pathway increase the size of peripheral tissues in a
cell-autonomous manner, whereas loss-of-function mu-
tations have the opposite effect (Chen et al. 1996; Bohni
et al. 1999; Weinkove et al. 1999). Recently, insulin was
found to control developmental timing, but not body or
organ size, during the period before Drosophila achieves
critical weight, whereas after reaching this set point in-
sulin no longer affected developmental timing, but only
body and organ size (Shingleton et al. 2005). Our analysis
of mutant development and behavior, which will be re-
ported elsewhere, found no differences in feeding or de-
velopmental timing between NF1 mutants and isogenic
controls. Moreover, the lack of dosage-sensitive genetic
interactions between NF1 and PI3 kinase p60 or Tor mu-
tants, and the observation that dILP2-GAL4-driven
UAS-NF1 expression in insulin-producing neuroendo-
crine cells does not modify NF1 size, all argue that in-
sulin deficiency is not likely to be a major contributor to
the NF1 size defect.

Drosophila growth and development are also coordi-
nated by a hormonal cascade involving juvenile hormone
(JH), prothoracicotrophic hormone (PTTH), and ecdy-
sone. JH and ecdysone are produced by the corpora allata
and the thoracic gland, respectively, which together with
the corpora cardiaca form the neuroendocrine ring
gland. PTTH stimulates ecdysone release and is made by
neurons that innervate the thoracic gland in response to
a developmentally controlled reduction in JH titer. JH

production, in turn, is controlled by insulin, explaining
the developmental delay and increased longevity of some
hypomorphic insulin pathway mutants (Tatar et al.
2001). Three groups recently reported that increasing the
size of the prothoracic gland by manipulations that ac-
tivate Ras1 or its Dp110 PI3 kinase effector impairs Dro-
sophila growth (Caldwell et al. 2005; Colombani et al.
2005; Mirth et al. 2005), possibly through ecdysone-me-
diated attenuation of insulin signaling in peripheral tis-
sues (Colombani et al. 2005). Again, our inability to
modify NF1 size by expressing UAS-NF1 in the protho-
racic gland, in other parts of the ring gland, or in neurons
that innervate the ring gland suggests that excess Ras
activity resulting from a loss of NF1 in these cells or
tissues does not provide an easy explanation for the im-
paired growth of NF1 mutants. Further arguing against
such a role, no obvious NF1 expression was detected in
the ring gland.

Ras2-GAL4 is among the most restricted drivers that
rescue NF1 size when driving UAS-NF1. This fact, com-
bined with the observation that neuronal but not glial
drivers similarly rescue, suggests that Ras2-GAL4-ex-
pressing cells are neuronal. It remains unclear in what
proportion of these cells NF1 is required to restore
growth, but costaining experiments revealed substantial
overlap between endogenous NF1 and Ras2-GAL4-
driven UAS-GFP expression. Moreover, Ras2-GAL4-
driven UAS-NF1 expression strongly suppressed the
larval CNS p-ERK phenotype. Several other findings
support our conclusion that a Ras signaling defect in
Ras2-GAL4-expressing cells is the primary cause of the
NF1 size defect. First, Ras2-GAL4-driven expression
of a functional NF1GRD is necessary and sufficient for
rescue. Second, Ras2-GAL4-driven expression of acti-
vated Ras1 or Ras2 phenocopied the NF1 size defect.
Third, Ras2-GAL4-driven expression of a Drosophila
p120RasGAP ortholog also rescued, arguing that the
ability to rescue reflects a property shared between NF1
and RasGAP. Interestingly, expression of a third Dro-
sophila RasGAP, Gap1, did not rescue either size or p-
ERK phenotypes. Whether the inability of Gap1 to sub-
stitute for NF1 reflects an inappropriate expression level
or some other factor—such as different regulation, local-
ization, or GTPase substrate specificity—remains to be
determined.

Initial reports that increasing cAMP/PKA activity res-
cued Drosophila NF1 phenotypes generated much inter-
est, in part because cAMP plays a prominent role in
learning, which is impaired in many children with NF1.
However, subsequent studies showed that genetic or
pharmacologic manipulations that attenuate Ras signal-
ing restored learning in heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice
(Costa et al. 2002). Altered Ras signaling in the CNS
appears capable of regulating the growth of the larval
epidermis and imaginal discs. This could occur by modu-
lating the levels of diffusible growth factors or growth
inhibitors. Conceivably, cAMP/PKA signaling could be
of importance at a more downstream component of this
pathway, such as the release of, or response to, such dif-
fusible factors.

Our results also demonstrate that heterozygous loss of
individual genes encoding canonical Ras pathway com-
ponents is insufficient to restore p-ERK activity in ho-
mozygous null or hypomorphic NF1 mutants. Interest-
ingly, combined loss of Raf and rl, Ras1 and Raf, and
Ras2 and Raf fully rescued the larval p-ERK defect, while
the former two double mutants partially restored pupal
size. Thus, Ras1 and Ras2 may jointly contribute to ERK
activation in NF1-deficient CNS. Whether Ras effectors
other than Raf/ERK contribute to the NF1 size defect,
and how enhanced PKA activity rescues NF1 phenotypes
remain to be determined.

NF1 mutagenesis screen

NF1 alleles were generated by crossing ethyl methane sulfonate
mutagenized second and third chromosome isogenized w1118
males to NF1P2 females. Screening 30,000 F1 pupae identified
three dominant mutations resembling the Tubby mutant, and
four recessive potential new NF1 alleles. NF1E3 represented a
deletion and was discarded. The NF1E1, NF1E2, and NF1E4 cod-
ing sequences were PCR-amplified and sequenced. Any de-
tected mutation was verified by analyzing independent PCR
products.

Transgenic rescue

Transgenic rescue experiments were performed using cultures
maintained on freshly prepared food at similar density. For pu-
pal size measurements, >50 pupae of each genotype were mea-
sured using a video-equipped microscope. Pupae were then al-
lowed to eclose, and measurements for >20 male or female pu-
pae were used to calculate average size, standard deviations, and
statistical significance. To allow for slight variations, controls
were included in each experiment. Wing surface areas were de-
termined using NIH Image 1.62 software. Wing cell density was
determined by counting the number of hairs in 0.01-mm2 areas
between the L2 and L3 veins, and between the L5 vein and the
wing edge. Hsp70 promoter-containing transgenes were induced
by a daily 30 min heat shock at 37°C. Wing disc cell size was

determined using a Cytomation MoFlo cytometer (Neufeld et
al. 1998), and data were analyzed using FloJo software (Tree Star,
Inc).

Transgenes

UAS-NF1 was made by transferring the insert of a hsp70-NF1
mini-gene (The et al. 1997) into the pUAS-T vector (Brand and
Perrimon 1993). This transgene includes the shorter C terminus
predicted by exon 18b (The et al. 1997) and lacks a 30-amino-
acid segment predicted by alternatively spliced exon 14. A
hsp70-NF12802 transgene that includes exon 14 and the longer
C-terminal segment predicted by exon 18a was generated by
standard cloning. Missense and deletion mutants were gener-
ated by PCR-based mutagenesis. UAS-NF1GRD transgenes
were engineered to include an AUG codon upstream of amino
acids 1214–1574, followed by a HA tag and a termination codon.
Ras1-GAL4 and Ras2-GAL4 drivers were generated by direc-
tionally cloning PCR-amplified 1850 (Ras1) and 358-base-pair
(Ras2) genomic segments representing the presumed transcrip-
tional promoters into the pChs-Gal4 vector (a gift from Dr. Hol-
ger Apitz). The insert for the UAS-Gap1 transgene was gener-
ated by PCR amplification of first strand cDNA and cloned into
pUAS-T (Brand and Perrimon 1993). All constructs were se-
quenced prior to embryo injection. Transgenic flies were gener-
ated by standard procedures. Further details about constructs
are available upon request.

GAP activity assay

A plasmid encoding a maltose-binding protein NF1GRD fusion
protein was made by cloning a PCR-amplified Drosophila NF1
cDNA segment encoding amino acids 1236–1594 into the
pMal-c2X (New England Biolabs) vector. cDNAs for Ras1
(CG9375), Ras2 (CG1167), Rap1 (CG1956), Rap2L (CG3204),
Rala (CG2849), and Rheb (CG1081) were PCR-amplified from
first strand cDNA and similarly cloned into pMal-c2X. All in-
sert sequences were verified. Soluble fusion proteins were affin-
ity-purified on Amylose resin. Active GTPase concentrations
were determined by ␣32P-GTP binding and GAP activity assays
performed as described, using 6 nM active GTPase per reaction
(Brill et al. 1996).

Miscellaneous techniques

Larvae were dissected in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Larval tis-
sues were stained with monoclonal antibody DNF1-21 (The et
al. 1997) and anti-mouse-Cy5 secondary antibody and viewed
using a Zeiss LM510 confocal microscope. For Western blot
analysis, larval CNS was dissected, collected on dry ice, and
homogenized in lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris at pH
7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM ␤-glycerolphos-
phate, 10 mM NaF; 1 mM Na3VO4). Adult fly heads were pre-
pared as described (Williams et al. 2001). IP-Western analysis
was performed using equal amounts of protein as described pre-
viously (The et al. 1997). Antibodies to detect ERK (M5670) and
p-ERK (M8159) were from Sigma. MEK1 (9122), p-MEK1 (9121),
Akt1 (4054), and p-Akt1 (9272) antibodies were from Cell Sig-
naling.
