Abstract

Neurofibromatosis  type  1  (NF1)  is  a  genetic  disorder  characterized  by  the 
development  of  multiple  neurofibromas,  cafe- au- lait  spots,  and  Lisch  nodules. 
Individuals  with  NF1  are  at  increased  risk  of  developing  various  tumors,  such 
as  malignant  peripheral  nerve  sheath  tumor  (MPNST),  pheochromocytoma, 
leukemia,  glioma,  rhabdomyosarcoma,  and  breast  cancer.  Here,  we  describe 
the  exome  sequencing  of  breast  cancer,  MPNST,  and  neurofibroma  from  a 
patient  with  NF1.  We  identified  a  germline  mutation  in  the  NF1  gene  which 
resulted  in  conversion  of  leucine  to  proline  at  amino  acid  position  847.  In 
addition,  we  showed  independent  somatic  NF1  mutations  in  all  the  three  tu-
mors  (frameshift  insertion  in  breast  cancer  (p.A985fs),  missense  mutation  in 
MPNST  (p.G23R),  and  inframe  deletion  in  dermal  neurofibroma  (p.L1876del- 
Inf)),  indicating  that  a  second  hit  in  NF1  resulting  in  the  loss  of  function 
could  be  important  for  tumor  formation.  Each  tumor  had  a  distinct  genomic 
profile  with  mutually  exclusive  mutations  in  different  genes.  Copy  number 
analysis  revealed  multiple  copy  number  alterations  in  the  breast  cancer  and 
the  MPNST,  but  not  the  benign  neurofibroma.  Germline  loss  of  chromosome 
6q22.33,  which  harbors  two  potential  tumor  suppressor  genes,  PTPRK  and 
LAMA2,  was  also  identified;  this  may  increase  tumor  predisposition  further. 
In  the  background  of  NF1  syndrome,  although  second- hit  NF1  mutation  is 
critical  in  tumorigenesis,  different  additional  mutations  are  required  to  drive 
the  formation  of  different  tumors.

Introduction

Neurofibromatosis  type  1  (NF1)  is  a  relatively  common 
genetic disorder characterized by the development of mul-
tiple  neurofibromas,  cafe- au- lait  spots,  and  Lisch  nodules, 
with  estimated  incidence  of  1  in  2,000  to  1  in  5,000 
individuals worldwide [1]. The NF1 gene on chromosome 
17q11.2  is  a  classic  tumor  suppressor  gene.  Its  product, 
neurofibromin  is  an  important  negative  regulator  of  the 
Ras  cellular  proliferation  pathway  [2,  3].  Individuals  with 
NF1  are  at  increased  risk  of  developing  various  tumors, 
including MPNST, pheochromocytoma, leukemia, glioma, 
and  rhabdomyosarcoma  [4].  More  recently,  an  increased 
risk  of  breast  cancer  has  also  been  reported  [5,  6].

The mechanism of pathogenesis of NF1- associated breast 
cancer  remains  unknown;  limited  data  suggest  an  aggres-
sive  biology  of  breast  cancer  in  NF1  patients  [7,  8]. 
Previously,  studies  on  genetic  aberrations  in  MPNST  fo-
cused  on  only  a  limited  set  of  genes,  reporting  mutations 
in  TP53  and  second  hit  NF1,  multiple  copy  number  al-
terations,  and  deletion  of  CDKN2A  [4,  9–11].  Recently 
published studies now report frequent somatic aberrations 
in  EED  and  SUZ12  as  well,  both  of  which  are  chromatin- 
modifying  genes  [12–14].

In this study, we sequenced the exomes of breast cancer, 
MPNST, dermal neurofibroma, and matched whole- blood 
from  a  single  NF1  patient.  The  objectives  were  to  unravel 
the  genomic  complexity  of  different  neoplastic  manifesta-
tions  of  NF1  and  to  identify  somatic  mutations  that  po-
tentially  drive  these  tumors.

Materials­and­Methods

Patient

this  study 

The  subject  of 
fulfilled  NIH  Consensus 
Development Conference diagnostic criteria for NF1; family 
history  was  also  positive  for  NF1.  At  the  age  of  39  years, 
she was diagnosed with right breast cancer. Histopathological 
examination  revealed  a  40  mm  grade  3  invasive  ductal 
carcinoma with metastasis to 1 of 17 lymph nodes. Estrogen-  
and  progesterone- receptor  status  was  positive.  HER2  was 
2+  in  30%  of  the  cells  by  immunohistochemistry,  and 
borderline  positive  on  fluorescent  in  situ  hybridization 
(FISH)  testing  with  a  ratio  of  HER2  to  chromosome  17 
signals  from  60  nuclei  scored  as  2.2,  and  an  average  of 
4.7  HER2  signals  per  nucleus.  Adjuvant  chemotherapy  as 
well as trastuzumab and tamoxifen were administered post-
operatively,  in  addition  to  radiotherapy.

Three  years  later,  she  presented  with  a  rapidly  growing 
soft  tissue  mass  beneath  the  right  buttock.  Excision  of 
this  mass  and  a  separate  dermal  neurofibroma  on  the 
right  buttock  was  performed;  the  pathological  diagnosis 

2

for the mass was malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor 
arising  from  a  plexiform  neurofibroma.  Sections  showed 
a  hypercellular  spindle  cell  tumor  with  large  areas  of  ne-
crosis  and  hemorrhage  and  high  mitotic  activity.

Blood and fresh frozen tumor specimens (breast cancer, 
MPNST,  dermal  neurofibroma)  were  obtained  from  this 
patient.  The  study  was  approved  by  the  local  Institutional 
Review  Board.  All  the  tumor  specimens  contained  at  least 
70% tumor by routine histologic review with hematoxylin 
and  eosin  staining.

Exome­capture­and­high­throughput­
sequencing

Three micrograms of DNA per sample were sheared using 
a Covaris S1 Ultrasonicator (Covaris, MA). Adaptor- ligated 
libraries  were  constructed  using  Paired- End  DNA  kits 
(Illumina,  CA).  Exome  capture  was  performed  using 
SureSelect  Human  All  Exon  Kit  v3  (Agilent  Technology, 
CA).  Each  sample  was  sequenced  on  two  lanes  of  an 
Illumina  GA- IIx  sequencer  using  76- bp  paired- end  reads. 
The image analysis and base calling were performed using 
the  Illumina  pipeline  (v1.6)  with  default  settings.

Sequence­mapping­and­coverage­
computation

Alignment  of  the  sequenced  reads  was  to  human  reference 
genome  hg19,  using  the  Burrows- Wheeler  Aligner  software 
[15]. PCR duplicates were removed using SAMTools. Variants 
were  called  using  a  pipeline  based  on  the  Genome  Analysis 
Toolkit  (GATK)  software  (Broad  Institute,  Massachusetts). 
Base quality scores were recalibrated and the sequences near 
microindels were realigned. Consensus calling for SNVs and 
microindels  was  done  with  the  GATK  Unified  Genotyper. 
Only  well- mapped  reads  and  reads  with  fewer  than  four 
mismatches  in  a  40  base- pair  window  were  considered.

The  putative  SNVs  and  microindels  were  annotated 
against  dbSNP  135  and  1000  Genomes  to  remove  com-
mon polymorphisms, excluding cancer- associated positions 
(based  on  presence  in  the  COSMIC  database  [Wellcome 
Trust  Sanger  Institute,  Cambridge,  United  Kingdom]). 
Using  transcripts  from  the  CCDS,  RefSeq,  Ensembl,  and 
UCSC databases, we identified nonsynonymous mutations 
and  classified  them  as  tumor- somatic  if  the  matched  nor-
mal sample had sufficient coverage to show that the variant 
was  not  present  in  the  germline.  Putative  mutations  were 
validated  by  Sanger  sequencing.

Copy­number­variation­analysis

Analysis  of  copy  number  and  regions  of 
loss- of- 
heterozygosity  was  performed  on  the  exome  sequencing

data using the ASCAT algorithm 2.0 (Allele- Specific Copy 
number  Analysis  of  Tumors)  (http://heim.ifi.uio.no/bio-
inf/Projects/ASCAT/).  For  higher  resolution,  the  blood, 
dermal  neurofibroma  and  primary  breast  tumor  samples 
were assayed using the Affymetrix CytoScan HD platform 
(Affymetrix, Inc, Santa Clara, CA). There was insufficient 
DNA  from  the  frozen  specimen  of  MPNST  for  the 
Cytoscan  copy  number  analysis.  Analysis  of  the  array 
data was performed with the Chromosome Analysis Suite 
software  (version  2.0.1)  from  Affymetrix.

Our  target  enrichment  and  sequencing  achieved  a  mean 
coverage  of  75,  with  an  average  of  83%  of  bases  covered 
by at least 20 reads in each sample (Table S1). To identify 
the  possible  NF1  germline  mutations  in  this  patient,  we 
inspected all variants detected in the patient’s blood DNA, 

and  identified  a  heterozygous  missense  mutation  of  thy-
midine  to  cytosine  (g.chr17:29,556,173).  This  mutation 
resulted  in  a  conversion  of  leucine  to  proline  at  amino 
acid  position  847,  which  is  also  present  in  all  the  tumor 
samples  confirmed  by  Sanger  sequencing,  indicating  ger-
mline  mutation  (Fig.  S1).

All  reported  mutations  were  validated  by  Sanger  se-
quencing in the four samples (blood, breast cancer, MPNST, 
and  dermal  neurofibroma;  Fig.  1,  Table  S2),  except  the 
insertion of cytosine in the NF1 gene (g.chr17:29,553,477) 
in  the  breast  cancer,  most  probably  due  to  repetitive  se-
quences  in  that  region  leading  to  slippages  in  Sanger 
sequencing. However, close inspection using the Integrated 
Genome  Viewer  software  suggests  a  true  insertion  event 
(Fig.  2).  The  somatic  mutations  identified  in  each  sample 
were  unique  to  the  tumor,  suggesting  that  each  different 
type  of  tumor  arose  independently  in  the  patient.

Consistent  with  the  fact  that  malignant  tumors  harbor 
more  somatic  mutations,  the  breast  cancer  and  MPNST 
harbored  15  and  6  somatic  mutations  respectively  (Fig.  1, 
Table  S2).  In  contrast,  only  one  somatic  mutation  was 
detected  in  the  dermal  neurofibroma,  a  benign  tumor 
(Fig.  1).  Interestingly,  this  in- frame  deletion  of  three

Figure 2. Analysis of copy number alterations in breast cancer (A), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) (B) and dermal neurofibroma 
(C),  based  on  paired  tumor  and  nontumor  DNA  analysis  of  exome  sequencing  data.  Each  red  dot  represents  a  genomic  coordinate  that  was 
heterozygous in the germline sample. The breast cancer shows the most chromosomal rearrangements while the dermal neurofibroma shows none. 
Regions of allelic imbalance that also show a decrease in Log R typically represent Loss- of- heterozygosity (LOH); regions of allelic imbalance with no 
change in Log R show Copy- Number Neutral LOH, and regions of allelic imbalance that correspond with increased Log R correspond to either focal 
amplifications (for example, several loci in chromosome 2 of the breast cancer) or large- scale amplifications. The changes in Log R and allele frequency 
observed across multiple chromosomes in breast cancer and MPNST indicate allelic imbalance or copy number alterations in these samples, but not 
in the dermal neurofibroma.

nucleotides  resulted  in  a  loss  of  leucine  at  amino  acid 
position  1876  in  the  NF1  gene  (Table  S2).  Different  so-
matic NF1 mutations (frameshift insertion in breast cancer 
(p.A985fs),  missense  mutation  in  MPNST  (p.G23R),  and 
inframe deletion in dermal neurofibroma (p.L1876del- Inf)) 
were  detected  in  all  three  tumors  investigated;  suggesting 
the  importance  of  second- hit  aberration  in  NF1  for 
tumorigenesis.

Several important and interesting mutations were identi-
fied  in  the  two  malignant  tumors.  The  breast  tumor 
harbored somatic mutations in TP53, GATA3, and ARID1A, 
which  are  commonly  mutated  or  lost  in  breast  cancer 
(Fig.  1).  Mutations  in  other  cancer- associated  genes  such 
as  MAGI3,  TSC1,  PTPN4,  RAB3IP,  and  RYR1  were  also 
identified. Aberrant protein degradation may be important 
in  this  cancer,  as  three  of  the  14  mutated  genes  (USP4, 
USP31,  and  ZNRF4)  in  the  breast  cancer  are  involved  in 

the  ubiquitin–proteasome  pathway.  In  the  MPNST,  aside 
from  the  NF1  mutation,  other  mutations  in  cancer- 
associated  genes  such  as  EHBP1  and  WNK3  were 
identified.

Extensive­copy­number­alterations­detected­
in­breast­cancer­and­MPNST

To  determine  the  extent  of  chromosomal  aberrations  in 
the  breast  cancer,  the  MPNST,  and  the  dermal  neurofi-
broma,  we  subjected  the  sequence  data  to  our  in- house 
modified  ASCAT  analysis.  Extensive  chromosomal  aber-
rations were observed in the breast cancer and the MPNST 
samples.  Unlike  the  profiles  seen  in  the  breast  cancer  and 
MPNST,  the  benign  dermal  neurofibroma  genome  is  “si-
lent”,  indicating  that  the  neurofibroma  genome  is  highly 
stable  (Fig.  2).

line) which harbor PTPRK and LAMA2, in blood, breast cancer, and dermal neurofibroma.

Gains  and  losses  in  several  cancer- related  genes  were 
identified in the breast cancer and MPNST samples through 
ASCAT  analysis  (Table  S3).  Consistent  with  a  previous 
report  on  chromosomal  aberrations  in  MPNST,  losses 
were more common than gains in the MPNST on ASCAT 
analysis [16]. Homozygous losses were found in CDKN2A 
and  CDKN2B,  which  play  important  roles  in  cell  cycle 
control,  and  in  ARID4B,  a  chromatin  remodeling  gene. 
Heterozygous  losses  were  observed  in  TP53  and  EED,  a 
component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), 
which  is  reported  to  be  frequently  altered  in  a  recent 
exome  sequencing  study  on  MPNSTs  [12].

Potential  oncogenes  amplified  in  the  breast  cancer  in-
clude  GREB1,  NRXN1,  MGAT5,  PKP4,  DAPL1,  ITGB6, 
and  RBMS1,  which  may  be  implicated  in  carcinogenesis, 
proliferation, and invasion. A focal amplification of around 
3  Mb  in  chromosome  2,  containing  the  FXBO11  and 
MSH6  genes,  was  estimated  to  contain  over  20  copies  of 
the  affected  genes.  We  observed  heterozygous  loss  of  sev-
eral  cancer- associated  genes, 
including  the  CTNNA1 
(catenin  (cadherin- associated  protein),  alpha  1)  and  APC 
tumor  suppressor  genes  in  the  breast  cancer.  With  the 
available  DNA,  we  further  confirmed  our  findings  in  the 
breast cancer and dermal neurofibroma using the Cytoscan 
platform  from  Affymetrix.

mosome  4  (p15.2),  chromosome  15  (q22.2  and  24.2), 
and  chromosome  17  (q12  and  q21.32),  whereas  loss  of 
heterozygosity  was  observed  in  chromosomes  2,  4,  5,  10, 
14,  17,  and  18  in  the  breast  cancer  genome  (Fig.  3  and 
Table  S4).

Interestingly,  we  have  identified  loss  of  chromosome 
6q22.33  (Fig.  3)  and  gain  of  chromosome  14q32.33  in 
the  DNA  from  the  patient’s  blood,  breast  cancer,  and 
dermal  neurofibroma  suggesting  germline  chromosomal 
aberrations. Two putative tumor suppressor genes, PTPRK 
and  LAMA2,  are  among  the  10  genes  identified  in  the 
loss region of chromosome 6; these germline chromosomal 
alterations  might  predispose  the  patient  to  cancer.

Discussion

Neurofibromatosis  type  1  is  a  common  genetic  disorder, 
but  until  recently  there  has  been  a  lack  of  data  on  the 
comprehensive  mutation  landscape  of  NF1- associated  tu-
mors.  This  is  set  to  change  with  the  increasing  availability 
of  next  generation  sequencing.  In  fact,  there  is  revival  of 
interest  in  the  NF1  gene  as  somatic  NF1  aberrations  are 
increasingly  detected  in  sporadic  tumors  from  individuals 
without  neurofibromatosis  type  1  syndrome  [8].

Using  Cytoscan,  copies  gained  were  observed  in  a  large 
region  of  chromosome  2  (p25.1,  p24.2,  p21,  q14.2,  q21.2, 

Whole- exome  sequencing  of  the  blood,  breast  cancer, 
MPNST,  and  dermal  neurofibroma  from  this  patient  has

in  this  tumor  predisposition  syndrome.  A  striking  feature 
is  the  finding  of  second- hit  NF1  mutation  at  different 
sites  of  this  gene  in  all  the  tumors  sequenced,  indicating 
that  second- hit  mutation  of  this  tumor  suppressor  gene 
may  be  a  critical  event  in  pathogenesis.  NF1  aberrations 
can  potentially  lead  to  activation  of  the  Ras,  MAP  kinase, 
and  PI3K- mTOR  pathways,  resulting  in  proliferation  of 
tumor  cells  [3,  17].  This  is  consistent  with  the  findings 
of  a  previous  study  which  reported  different  somatic  NF1 
alterations in multiple benign neurofibromas and a MPNST 
obtained postmortem from an NF1 patient [18]. Denaturing 
high- performance  liquid  chromatography  (dHPLC),  mi-
crosatellite  analysis  using  RFLP  markers  and  multiplex 
ligation  probe  amplification  (MLPA)  for  the  NF1  gene 
were  performed  in  that  study  [18].  With  whole- exome 
sequencing,  we  have  found  that  each  tumor  from  the 
same  individual  also  has  a  distinct  set  of  genes  mutated. 
The different clonal origins indicate that each tumor arises 
from  independent  somatic  events  in  the  background  of 
germline  NF1  mutation.

Incidentally,  we  have  also  discovered  germline  loss  of 
two  potential 
tumor  suppressor  genes—PTPRK  and 
LAMA2—on  chromosome  6  (q22.33).  PTPRK  appears  to 
be  a  negative  regulator  of  adhesion,  invasion,  migration, 
and  proliferation  in  various  tumor  types,  including  breast 
and colorectal cancers, gliomas, lymphoma, and melanoma 
cells.  It  may  play  a  role  in  inhibition  of  Akt,  EGFR,  and 
beta- catenin  signaling  [19–23].  LAMA2  encodes  an  extra-
cellular  matrix  protein.  Reduced  LAMA2  expression  in 
hepatocellular carcinomas has been linked to a proliferative 
signature with poorer survival outcomes; hypermethylation 
of LAMA2 has also been reported in colorectal carcinomas 
[24,  25].  To  our  knowledge,  germline  loss  of  PTPRK  and 
LAMA2  has  not  been  reported;  this  may  increase  the 
tumor  predisposition  further.

The  mutation  landscape  of  breast  cancer  is  highly  het-
erogeneous.  In  this  case  of  NF1- associated  breast  cancer, 
mutations  in  the  TP53,  TSC1,  and  MAGI3  (PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway) tumor suppressors are likely to cooperate 
with  NF1  in  carcinogenesis.  In  addition,  alterations  of 
genes  critical  in  other  pathways,  such  as  ARID1A  (SWI/
SNF  chromatin  remodeling),  GATA3  (differentiation  of 
luminal breast cells), PTPN4 (antiapoptosis), RYR1 (control 
of cellular proliferation), and USP4, USP31, ZNRF4 (ubiq-
uitin–proteasome  pathway)  may  be  implicated  in  patho-
genesis.  The  multiple  copy  number  alterations  detected 
also  result  in  genomic  instability.  Gains  in  some  of  the 
genes  involved  in  invasive/migratory  properties  (MGAT5, 
PKP4,  ITGB6),  cell  cycle  progression  and  regulation  of 
apoptosis  (RBMS1),  and  angiogenesis  (NRXN1)  may  be 
involved 
tumor  development  and  progression. 
Amplification  of  GREB1,  an  early  response  gene  in  the 

in

estrogen  receptor- regulated  pathway,  may  play  a  role  in 
this  estrogen  receptor  positive  tumor.

The mechanism of pathogenesis for the MPNST is likely 
related  to  second- hit  inactivation  of  NF1,  together  with 
mutations  in  other  genes,  such  as  WNK3  which  plays  a 
role in the increase of cell survival in a caspase- 3- dependent 
pathway,  and  EHBP1  which  has  been  implicated  in  en-
docytic  trafficking.  A  single- nucleotide  polymorphism  in 
EHBP1  has  been  associated  with  an  aggressive  form  of 
prostate  cancer;  it  may  be  implicated  in  carcinogenesis 
or  cell  survival  [26].  Somatic  loss  of  critical  tumor  sup-
pressors  including  CDKN2A,  CDKN2B,  TP53,  and  EED 
are  also  likely  to  contribute  to  tumorigenesis.  Aberrations 
in  EED  and  SUZ12  occur  frequently  in  sporadic,  NF1- 
associated  and  radiotherapy- associated  MPNSTs  [12–14]. 
EED  and  SUZ12  are  core  subunits  of  PRC2;  the  resulting 
PRC2  inactivation  can  lead  to  loss  of  trimethylation  at 
lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), and increased H3K27 
acetylation  which  recruits  bromodomain  proteins  and 
transcription  factors  to  promote  tumor  growth  [12,  14].
The  low  mutation  burden  and  lack  of  copy  number 
changes  in  the  dermal  neurofibroma  is  consistent  with 
the  benign  nature  of  this  tumor.  Each  neurofibroma  con-
sists  of  a  heterogeneous  collection  of  hyperproliferative 
Schwann  cells,  as  well  as  fibroblasts,  perineural  cells,  and 
mast  cells  [18].  Although  the  second- hit  somatic  NF1 
mutation  in  the  Schwann  cells  may  trigger  the  formation 
of  a  neurofibroma  in  an  NF1- haploinsufficient  microen-
vironment,  the  precise  molecular  interactions  among  the 
different cells in the development of neurofibromas remain 
poorly  understood.

Challenges  remain  in  the  detection  of  aberrations  in 
the  NF1  gene.  NF1  is  one  of  the  largest  human  genes, 
with  60  exons  and  350kB  of  genomic  DNA.  While  next 
generation  sequencing  platforms  may  facilitate  the  si-
multaneous  sequencing  of  the  various  exons,  it  may  not 
capture  intronic  splicing  mutations;  analysis  to  detect 
aberrations and validation of mutations can pose a major 
challenge.  Design  of  primers  to  validate  the  mutations 
detected  with  next  generation  sequencing  can  be  com-
plicated  and  not  feasible  at  certain  sites  along  the  large 
gene,  due  to  the  presence  of  multiple  pseudogenes  in 
the  human  genome  [8].

In  summary,  second- hit  inactivation  of  NF1  appears 
to  be  a  common  feature  of  various  tumors  in  the  NF1 
syndrome.  However,  the  complexity  of  the  pathogenesis 
of  various  tumors  remains  to  be  elucidated.  Besides  loss 
of NF1 function, additional aberrations in other important 
cancer- related  genes  involving  various  pathways  lead  to 
the development of specific tumors. Further investigations 
on  additional  tumor  specimens  from  more  NF1  patients 
will  improve  our  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  of 
pathogenesis  in  this  tumor  predisposition  syndrome.
