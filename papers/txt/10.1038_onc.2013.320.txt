for neuroﬁbromatosis type 2

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is caused by mutations in the NF2 gene that encodes a tumor-suppressor protein called merlin. NF2
is characterized by formation of multiple schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Merlin loss-of-function is associated
with increased activity of Rac and p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and deregulation of cytoskeletal organization. LIM domain kinases
(LIMK1 and 2) are substrate for Cdc42/Rac-PAK and modulate actin dynamics by phosphorylating coﬁlin at serine-3. This
modiﬁcation inactivates the actin severing and depolymerizing activity of coﬁlin. LIMKs also translocate into the nucleus and
regulate cell cycle progression. Signiﬁcantly, LIMKs are overexpressed in several tumor types, including skin, breast, lung, liver and
prostate. Here we report that mouse Schwann cells (MSCs) in which merlin function is lost as a result of Nf2 exon2 deletion (Nf2DEx2)
exhibited increased levels of LIMK1, LIMK2 and active phospho-Thr508/505-LIMK1/2, as well as phospho-Ser3-coﬁlin, compared
with wild-type normal MSCs. Similarly, levels of LIMK1 and 2 total protein and active phosphorylated forms were elevated in human
vestibular schwannomas compared with normal human Schwann cells (SCs). Reintroduction of wild-type NF2 into Nf2DEx2 MSC
reduced LIMK1 and LIMK2 levels. We show that pharmacological inhibition of LIMK with BMS-5 decreased the viability of Nf2DEx2
MSCs in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect viability of control MSCs. Similarly, LIMK knockdown decreased viability of
Nf2DEx2 MSCs. The decreased viability of Nf2DEx2 MSCs was not due to caspase-dependent or -independent apoptosis, but rather due
to inhibition of cell cycle progression as evidenced by accumulation of cells in G2/M phase. Inhibition of LIMKs arrests cells in early
mitosis by decreasing aurora A activation. Our results suggest that LIMKs are potential drug targets for NF2 and tumors associated
with merlin deﬁciency.

INTRODUCTION
Mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene NF2 cause neuroﬁbro-
matosis type 2 (NF2), an autosomal-dominant disorder with an
incidence of about 1 in 25 000 individuals.1 The characteristic
feature of NF2 is
the development of bilateral vestibular
schwannomas (VSs) that typically cause deafness, facial paralysis
and disequilibrium following surgical removal to prevent life-
threatening complications. Frequently, NF2 patients also develop
multiple schwannomas in other nerves, as well as meningiomas
and ependymomas.2 Mutations in the NF2 gene are also common
in malignant mesothelioma.3 Currently, the standard treatment for
NF2 schwannomas is microsurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery.
Unfortunately,
limited operability, poor preservation of hearing,
diminished functionality of facial nerves and the small risk of
radiation-induced malignant
transformation later compromise
good clinical outcomes. Only a handful of NF2 preclinical and
clinical trials are ongoing, all of which utilize existing anti-cancer
drugs.4,5

The NF2 gene encodes a tumor suppressor called merlin or
schwannomin. Merlin regulates a number of processes
in
Schwann cells (SCs).6,7 Normal SCs usually proliferate slowly and
adopt a bipolar morphology; however, merlin-deﬁcient human
schwannoma cells (HSCs) exhibit abnormalities in proliferation,
motility and morphology in vitro.8 The mechanism of action of

merlin remains poorly understood, but appears to involve
regulation of
and turnover by
modulation of their interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and
transduction of downstream signals.7 A potential pathway
through which merlin regulates the actin cytoskeleton involves
Cdc42/Rac-p21-activated kinase (PAK)-LIM domain kinase (LIMK)-
coﬁlin.9–11 Loss of merlin function is associated with elevated
levels of active Rac and PAK, suggesting that merlin is a negative
regulator of Rac and PAK-dependent pathways. Conversely, PAK
phosphorylates and inactivates
tumor-suppressor activity of
merlin.12,13 Work from our laboratory has shown that activation
of b1-integrin in normal
PAK-dependent
phosphorylation of merlin at serine-51814. Although PAK has
been studied as a potential therapeutic target for NF2, its large
number of substrates confounds its usefulness.15

SCs promotes

The LIMK family has two members, LIMK1 and LIMK2, which can
be phosphorylated by Cdc42/Rac-PAK1, 2 and 4 at threonine-505/
508 and converted into active serine/threonine kinases. LIMKs are
also regulated by Rho-associated kinases and the myotonic
dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase. The major LIMK
substrate is the actin depolymerizing and severing protein coﬁlin/

cytoplasm and focal adhesions, where they modulate cell
morphology and motility, to the centrosome and nucleus, where
they regulate mitosis and cytokinesis.18–24 LIMKs interact with
aurora A, a serine/threonine kinase involved in centrosome
dynamics, spindle assembly and chromosome alignment and
segregation during mitosis.25,26 Aurora A is found on duplicated
centrosomes and mitotic spindle microtubules. During early
co-localize with g-tubulin in the
mitosis, phospho-LIMKs
centrosomes. In metaphase, LIMK1 is found at the spindle poles
and later redistributes to the cleavage furrow. LIMK2 is located
along the spindle and at the cleavage furrow of post-mitotic cells.
LIMK1 is a substrate for, and phosphorylates, aurora A to promote
its autophosphorylation at Thr288.27 LIMK2 is an aurora A
substrate and stabilizes it by kinase and scaffolding actions.28
LIMKs are overexpressed and implicated in various cancers, such
as breast,
liver and prostate, and several tumor cell
lines.29–32 Hence, LIMKs are emerging cancer targets; yet, few
inhibitors have been identiﬁed.33

lung, skin,

We show that the levels of total and phosphorylated LIMK and
its phosphorylated substrate are elevated in sporadic VSs
compared with normal HSCs. Utilizing Nf2DEx2 mouse SCs (MSCs)
as a cellular model of NF2, we show that pharmacological
inhibition or genetic silencing of LIMK signiﬁcantly reduces
proliferation of Nf2DEx2 MSCs, but does not substantially affect
control Nf2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 MSCs. The decreased proliferation is due to cell
cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Pharmacological
inhibition of
LIMKs with BMS-5 slows mitotic progression by decreasing
phosphorylation of coﬁlin and aurora A. These studies suggest
that LIMKs are potential therapeutic targets for NF2 and other
merlin-deﬁcient tumors.

RESULTS
LIMK and phospho-coﬁlin levels are elevated in Nf2DEx2 MSCs
compared with controls
Using two complementary techniques, we assessed the levels of
LIMK and phospho-Ser3-coﬁlin in Nf2-deﬁcient (Nf2DEx2) MSC lines
developed by in vitro ad-Cre deletion of Nf2 exon2 from Nf2ﬂox2/ﬂox2
MSCs.34 By immunostaining Nf2DEx2, MSCs were conﬁrmed to be
merlin-deﬁcient and expressed the SC marker S100 (Figure 1a).
Merlin-deﬁcient SCs were larger than control Nf2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 MSCs and
had increased levels of F-actin revealed by phalloidin staining. The
intensity of LIMK1 and LIMK2 immunoﬂuorescence was higher in
Nf2DEx2 MSCs than in controls and was detected throughout the cell.
Consistent with increased LIMK activity, the intensity of phospho-
Ser3-coﬁlin immunoﬂuorescence was also higher in Nf2DEx2 MSCs
than in controls (Figures 1a and b).

We also assessed merlin expression in control Nf2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 and
Nf2DEx2 MSCs by western blotting using an N-terminal merlin
antibody. Merlin was detected in Nf2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 MSCs but not in
Nf2DEx2 MSCs (Figure 1c). The status of the Nf2 gene was also
conﬁrmed by PCR analysis of DNA and revealed deletion of exon 2
in Nf2DEx2 as evidenced by a 338-bp band (Figure 1d).34

In addition, western blotting conﬁrmed that levels of both
LIMK1 and LIMK2 protein were higher in Nf2DEx2 MSCs than in
Nf2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 MSCs (Figure 1e). We detected a coordinate increase in
the level of phospho-Ser3-coﬁlin in Nf2DEx2 MSCs with respect to
control consistent with high levels of LIMK activity (Figure 1f).

Reintroduction of wild-type NF2 normalizes LIMK protein levels
To assess whether elevated LIMK levels were linked to merlin
inactivation, we reintroduced a halo-tagged wild-type human NF2
into Nf2DEx2 MSCs by nucleofection. This method yielded B10%
transfection rate, determined by halo-tag ﬂuorescence labeling.
Reexpression of merlin in cultured Nf2DEx2 MSCs generally
decreased LIMK1, LIMK2 and phospho-Ser3-coﬁlin levels (Figures

2a and b). This result supports a relationship between merlin
inactivation and increased LIMK expression and activity.

Pharmacological inhibition of LIMK1/2 by BMS-5 or genetic
silencing of LIMK1/2 reduces Nf2DEx2 MSC viability
We next sought to determine whether LIMK was a potential drug
target
for NF2. We tested the efﬁcacy of BMS-5, a highly
selective small-molecule inhibitor of LIMK1/2, on reducing
phosphorylation of coﬁlin on Ser3.35 BMS-5 inhibited coﬁlin-Ser3
phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in Nf2DEx2 MSCs
with an IC50 ofB2 mM (Figures 3a and b). We next tested the ability
of BMS-5 to reduce viability of Nf2DEx2 MSCs. The 100% viability
control was 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and a positive cell
death control was obtained with 50 mM rapamycin that caused
approximately 80% cell death in 24 h. BMS-5 reduced Nf2DEx2 MSC
viability in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 3.9 mM
(Figure 3c), but did not signiﬁcantly reduce the viability of control
Nf2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 MSCs at equivalent BMS-5 concentrations (Figure 3d).
At 10 mM BMS-5, Nf2DEx2 MSC viability was 40% compared with
83% for controls.

To conﬁrm the validity of LIMK as a drug target, we knocked
down LIMK1 and LIMK2 in Nf2DEx2 MSCs using lentiviral shRNA
transduction (Supplementary Figure S1). Consistent with the BMS-
5 results, LIMK1 and LIMK2 knockdown reduced viability of Nf2DEx2
MSCs compared with scrambled shRNA controls in a 24-h assay
(Figure 3e). These results suggest that LIMK inhibition or silencing
in merlin-deﬁcient cells reduces their viability either by promoting
cell death or hindering proliferation.

Decreased viability of Nf2DEx2 MSCs in response to BMS-5 or LIMK
silencing is independent of apoptosis
To determine if BMS-5 promoted Nf2DEx2 MSC apoptosis, we
measured caspase 3/7 activity. We found that BMS-5 did not
activate caspase 3/7, whereas the positive control, staurosporine,
promoted dose-dependent activation of caspase 3/7 (Figure 5a).
To determine if BMS-5 promoted caspase-independent apoptosis,
we analyzed BMS-5-treated Nf2DEx2 MSCs by ﬂow cytometry using
a ratiometric membrane asymmetry probe that detects loss of
membrane phospholipid asymmetry associated with apoptosis.
We observed only a small increase (3.5%) of apoptotic cells after
7 h of BMS-5 treatment (Figure 4b). Consistent with pharmacolo-
gical LIMK inhibition, knockdown of LIMK1 or LIMK2 was not
associated with caspase 3/7 activity increase compared with
scrambled shRNA controls examined 24 h after plating (Figure 4c).
Similarly, caspase-independent apoptosis was not observed in
Nf2DEx2 MSCs transduced with either LIMK1 or LIMK2 shRNA
(Figure 4d). These results suggest that pharmacological inhibition
and genetic silencing of LIMK affect Nf2DEx2 MSC viability through
an apoptosis-independent mechanism.

Pharmacological inhibition of LIMK1/2 by BMS-5 reduces DNA
synthesis and cell cycle progression
We next assessed the ability of BMS-5 to interfere with
proliferation of Nf2DEx2 MSCs. The cells were incubated with 1
and 2 mM BMS-5 for 24, 48 and 72 h, and cell numbers were
measured using crystal violet staining. We observed fewer BMS-5-
treated Nf2DEx2 MSCs than DMSO-treated controls (Figure 5a). In
addition, we found that BMS-5 decreased DNA synthesis in Nf2DEx2
MSCs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5b).

To test the possibility that the decrease in proliferation was a
consequence of cell cycle inhibition, we performed ﬂow cytometry
analysis of cells stained with propidium iodine (PI). BMS-5 interfered
with Nf2DEx2 MSCs cell cycle progression as evidenced by an increase
in the percentage of diploid cells trapped in the G2/M phase
(Figure 6a). We further analyzed the distribution of cells among
the cell cycle phases using a BrdU/7AAD assay. There was a
signiﬁcant increase in the number of cells accumulating in the G2/M

number of BMS-5-treated cells in G1 as compared with control (41%
vs 26%). This is consistent with the results obtained by analysis of PI
staining (Figures 6b and c). Overlay of the 7AAD-area histograms

BMS-5 compared with DMSO-treated cells (Figure 6d). Furthermore,
the increase in the G2/M population was accompanied by an
increase in the number of cells with higher DNA content, consistent
with a polyploidy or multinucleated cell population. There was also a
smaller but substantial change in number of cells detected in the S

DMSO control. Lastly, the population of cells in the S phase
decreased with increasing BMS-5 concentration (Supplementary
Figure S2). These results taken together suggest that inhibition of
LIMK activity in Nf2DEx2 MSCs interferes with progression of the G2/M
phase of the cell cycle, thereby decreasing the number of viable
Nf2DEx2 MSCs.

BMS-5 inhibition of LIMK1/2 activity decreases aurora A
phosphorylation and causes formation of abnormal mitotic
spindles
To identify additional downstream effects of BMS-5 (beyond
inhibition of coﬁlin-Ser3 phosphorylation) that could cause a G2/M
arrest, we tested the levels of aurora A phosphorylation. Aurora A
interacts with both LIMK1 and 2 and is a major regulator of mitotic
spindle assembly and chromosomal alignment and segregation.
We found that Nf2DEx2 MSCs treated with increasing concentra-
tions of BMS-5 had a dose-dependent decreased phosphorylation
of aurora A at Thr288 (Figures 7a and b).

We next studied the effect of BMS-5 on the spindle assembly
visualizing the mitotic nuclei and spindle machinery by immuno
staining. We found that Nf2DEx2 MSCs had normal spindle assembly
and BMS-5-treated Nf2DEx2 MSCs showed abnormal spindle structure
(Figure 8a). Analyzing the centrosome positioning by immunostain-
ing for centrin-1, we found that BMS-5-treated cells were not able to
organize the centrosomes and generally had more than two with
different sizes (Figure 8b). We conducted cell cycle analysis and
found that the percentage of cells in late G2/M, visualized by positive
immunostaining for the mitotic marker phospho-Ser10-histone3,

signiﬁcantly increased from 5 to 17% in the BMS-5-treated Nf2DEx2
MSCs compared with DMSO controls (Figures 8c and d). We
observed a highly signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage BMS-5-
treated Nf2DEx2 MSCs that advanced to late mitotic phases
(anaphase/telophase). Moreover, BMS-5-treated Nf2DEx2 MSCs had
abnormal spindles, and chromosomes did not align at the center as
occurs in metaphase (Figures 8a–e). These results suggest that LIMK
inhibition exerts its anti-proliferative effect not only by altering
organization of the actin cytoskeleton through inhibition of coﬁlin
phosphorylation but also by decreasing LIMK-dependent activation
of aurora A.

LIMK levels are elevated in representative samples of human VS
compared with HSCs
To examine the relevance of LIMK inhibition to NF2, we compared
LIMK1 and LIMK2 protein and phosphorylation levels in a small
number of samples of HSCs from normal individuals and sporadic
human VSs. We observed a signiﬁcant increase (Po0.05 deter-
mined using unpaired t-test of HSC vs VS populations, two-tailed)
in both the protein and phospho-Thre508 levels of LIMK1 in VSs
compared with HSCs (Figures 9a and b). Similarly, both LIMK2 and
phospho-Thr505-LIMK2 levels showed a tendency to be higher in
VSs compared with HSCs (Figures 9c and d).
Interestingly, the
proportion of phospho-Ser3-coﬁlin to the total coﬁlin was higher
in VSs than in HSCs (Figure 9e).

We also measured LIMK protein and phosphorylation levels in a
HSC line, HEI-193, developed from a NF2 patient by immortaliza-
tion with HPV E6-E7 genes.36 Although the phospho-Thr508/

phosphorylation and inactivation of coﬁlin downstream of

shRNA knockdown of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in Nf2DEx2 MSCs conﬁrmed

Recently, LIMK has been show to promote tumor neovascular-
ization through the VEGF/p38/MK2/LIMK1/annexin1 pathway.40
This ﬁnding may potentially connect LIMK inhibition with the
observed reduction in angiogenesis in vivo following treatment
with bevacizumab, which reduces tumor volumes and, in some
some hearing.4 Thus, we speculate that
patients,
inhibition of LIMK might halt tumor progression not only by
interfering with cell cycle progression in schwannoma cells but
also by inhibiting angiogenesis.

restores

In conclusion, our studies suggest a potential therapeutic target
for NF2, the LIMKs, which are recognized substrates of Cdc42/Rac-
PAK1,2,4. We show enhanced LIMK expression and activity in
merlin-deﬁcient MSCs, as well as VSs, as opposed to controls.
Reduction in LIMK activity or protein levels decreases Nf2-deﬁcient
MSC viability by arresting cells in the prometaphase stage of the
cell cycle in association with decreased activation of aurora A
necessary for centrosome and mitotic spindle organization. Future
studies addressing whether LIMK inhibition is an effective
treatment
for schwannomas in mouse models of NF2 are
warranted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inhibitors
LIMK1/2 inhibitor, BMS-5 (CAS name (N-(5-(192,6-dichlorophenyl)-3-(diﬂuor-
omethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)thiazol-2-yl)isobutyramide) was
from SynKinase
(Shanghai, China). Rapamycin and staurosporine were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Antibodies
Antibodies used were purchased from the following sources: phospho-
coﬁlin-Ser3 (77G2), merlin (D1D8), phospho-LIMK1(Thr508)/LIMK2(Thr505)
(D2C8), a-tubulin
(used in cell
(DM1A), phospho-aurora A(Thr288)(D13A11) and b-actin (8H10D10) from
Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA); LIMK1 (clone42) mouse monoclonal

lines), LIMK1, phospho-Histone3(Ser10)

expression levels. Thus, we only used cells within their ﬁrst two
passages after puromycin selection. We speculate that Nf2DEx2
MSCs
a methylation-dependent
mechanism as shown for PAK shRNAs in schwannoma cells.15

LIMK shRNA by

Inhibition of LIMK activity with BMS-5 reduced Nf2DEx2 MSC
viability by arresting them at the M phase of the cell cycle. Others
have shown that the localization and activity of LIMK changes
during the cell cycle and that coﬁlin phosphorylation dynamics are
necessary for successful cytokinesis.21,23,24 Importantly, LIMK1
knockdown in HeLa cells or treatment with a LIMK-inhibitor
peptide resulted in delayed mitotic progression and irregular
spindle orientation.22 These reports support our conclusion that
inhibition of LIMK activity with BMS-5 arrested Nf2-deﬁcient cells
in the M phase, thereby decreasing the number of cells in S phase
and increasing the number of polyploid cells.

The reported interaction and functional cooperation of LIMK1
and 2 with aurora A led us to explore the effect of LIMK inhibition
with BMS-5 on aurora A autophosphorylation.25 In agreement with
the observations made with LIMK1 knockdown in PC-3 cells, we
found that BMS-5 reduced aurora A phosphorylation at Thr288.27
It is important to note that BMS-5 does not directly inhibit aurora
A kinase activity, because BMS-5 (compound 3 in Ross-Macdonald
et al.35) was tested in vitro against a panel of kinases, and aurora A
retained 100% activity when tested with 10 mM BMS-5.35
Interestingly, the abnormal spindle and centrosome organization
observed here resembles the abnormal metaphase spindles with
multipolar
shape and non-assembled
chromosomes observed in a LIMK2 knockdown in SH-EP
neuroblastoma cells.24 The integrity of the mitotic spindle is
required for progression from metaphase to anaphase, and any
abnormality in the spindle assembly checkpoint delays or hinders
the onset of anaphase. Hence, inhibition of LIMK activity by BMS-5
leads to inhibition of aurora A kinase activity, and thus provides a
molecular pathway for the G2/M block of merlin-deﬁcient SCs
treated with BMS-5.

Generation of Nf2DEx2 MSCs
Nf2DEx2 MSCs were generated in vitro by transducing Nf2ﬂox2/ﬂox2 SCs with
an Adeno-Cre virus (University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core) as
previously described.41 The Nf2DEx2 MSCs were used up to passage 20. All
protocols are in accordance with the guidelines of and approved by the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
(AAALAC)
International-certiﬁed University of Central Florida (UCF)
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

HSC cultures
Vials of frozen puriﬁed HSCs received from Dr Patrick Wood at the University
of Miami School of Medicine (Miami, FL, USA) were thawed and cultured on
Corning (Corning Inc. Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA) dishes coated with
200 mg/ml poly-L-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 mg/ml laminin
(Invitrogen) containing D10M growth media: DMEM (Gibco, Life Technolo-
gies, Grand Island, NY, USA) plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), 2 mM Forskolin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA),
0.02 mg/ml pituitary extract (Biomedical Technologies Inc, Stoughton, MA,
USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). Frozen vials from the stock
bank of HSC were prepared by the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency at
the University of Miami School of Medicine and cannot be traced to the
speciﬁc donor. HSCs were prepared from 10 cm biopsy of sural nerve/cauda
equine from cadaveric adult human donors. Nerve fragments were incubated
for several days, dissociated and plated. SCs were puriﬁed by immunopan-
ning with NGFR (nerve growth factor receptor) p75 antibodies. Culture purity
based on S100 immunostaining was 96–99%. HEI-193 cells were purchased
from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in DMEM plus 10% heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Human schwannoma samples
Frozen specimens of human sporadic VSs with different types of NF2
mutations were procured with patient informed consents at the Ohio State
University according to the Institutional Review Board regulations.

Western blot analysis
Cultured cells were lysed in modiﬁed RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate with protease
inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3; Sigma-Aldrich).
VS specimens (0.1–0.2 g) were homogenated in 900 ml of modiﬁed RIPA buffer
with 25–30 strokes in a Wheaton Micro Tissue Grinder glass set no. 528
(Wheaton Scientiﬁc, Millville, NJ, USA) on ice. Lysates were rotated for 10 min at
4 1C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 1C, 15 000 r.p.m. Protein concentration was
determined by DC Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and 10–20 mg of protein
in lamelli buffer was resolved in 10% or 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Pierce/
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane
(Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and analyzed using western
blotting with anti-LIMK1, (1:500) from BD (San Jose, CA, USA) for human
samples and (1:500) from Cell Signaling for mouse samples, LIMK2 (1:500),
P-coﬁlin-Ser3 (1:1500), coﬁlin (1:70 000), merlin (1:500), S-100 (1:300), P-LIMK1-
Thr508 (1:1000), P-LIMK2-Thr505 (1:1000) and P-LIMK1(Thr508)/LIMK2(Thr505)
(1:200) used in mouse and HEI-193 cell lines, P-aurora (1:1000), aurora A (1:500)
and b-actin (1:15 000),
followed by corresponding secondary antibodies
(1:20 000). Western blots were quantiﬁed by densitometry using NIH ImageJ
software. Intensities were normalized to b-actin-loading controls.

LIMK1 and LIMK2 knockdown in Nf2DEx2 MSCs
Nf2DEx2 MSCs were plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated (200 mg/ml) six-well
dishes, cultured at 37 1C, 7% CO2,
in medium containing DMEM/F12
(Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) plus N2 supplement
(Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
When cultures reached 40% conﬂuence, lentiviral transduction particles were
added at ﬁve multiplicity of infection in growth medium plus 8 mg/ml

hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma). MISSION shRNA lentiviral particles for
mouse gene silencing were from Sigma-Aldrich. LIMK1 clone IDs:
NM_010717.1-1546s1c1 (named construct no. 44); NM_010717.1-1414s1c1
(no. 47) and LIMK2 clone IDs: NM_010718.1-1409s1c1 (no. 73) and
NM_010718.3-827s21c1 (no. 95). Negative control was pLKO.1-puro non-
mammalian shRNA (SHC002V). Optimum multiplicity of infection determined
empirically with pLKO.1-puro-CMV-TurboGFP transduction lentiviral particle
(SHC003V) titer. After 18–20 h, infection medium was replaced with fresh
medium for 24 h and subsequently replaced with growth medium containing
1 mg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) to select transduced cells. The puromycin
concentration was determined by plotting a toxicity curve.

Reintroduction of NF2 into Nf2DEx2 MSCs
To reintroduce merlin into Nf2DEx2 MSCs, 1.5–2 million cells were
resuspended in 100 ml of basic nucleofector solution for mammalian glial
cells with supplements (Lonza, Cologne, Germany) plus 1 mg of pFC15K
HaloTagCMVd1-NF2 using an Amaxa Nucleofector II device and Program
A-033. One milliliter of warm growth medium was added, and 50 ml of cell
suspension was seeded on coated 11-mm round German glass coverslips
(Carolina Biology, Burlington, NC, USA) containing 100 ml of equilibrated
growth medium and incubated 40 h at 37 1C, 7% CO2, before analysis.

Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were plated on coated German glass coverslips and immunostained as
previously described.41 Labeling of Halo-Tag-NF2-transfected cells was
done in vivo with HaloTag TMR Ligand (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
following the manufacturer’s rapid labeling protocol. Confocal images were
acquired with a Zeiss (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA)
LSM710 microscope with three spectral detection channels, ﬁve laser
lines—458, 488, 514, 543 and 633 nm, FL ﬁlter set 49 DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole), EX G365 shift free, FL ﬁlter set 43 CY 3 shift free, FL ﬁlter set
38 Endow GFP, shift free, Plan-Apochromat  63/1.40 oil DIC M27 and EC
Plan-Neoﬂuar  40/1.3 DIC WD¼ 0.21 M27 objective lenses on an
AxioObserver Z1 Stand (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.) and ZEN2009
software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.). Fluorescence was collected from
a single plane on separate channels maintaining the same acquisition
parameters for each labeled protein. Images from each experiment were
processed identically with ZEN2011 software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.).
For spindle images, Z-stacks were collected with the  63 oil objective and
3.5 zoom factor. Two-dimensional images were obtained by median ﬁlter
and maximum intensity projection with ZEN2011.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was assessed by CellTiter-Fluor assay (Promega) following the
manufacturer’s
format,
centrifuged 1 min at 500 r.p.m. and incubated at 37 1C, 7% CO2. After cell
attachment (2.5–3.5 h), 5 ml/well of compound/vehicle solution was added
and plates were quick spinned and incubated for 24 h. Fluorescence was
measured with a Synergy H1 Hybrid plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

Membrane asymmetry assay
Cell membrane asymmetry was measured with the Violet Ratiometric
Membrane Asymmetry Probe/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Invitrogen/Life
Technologies). Cells were seeded in 200 mg/ml poly-L-lysine-coated six-well
plates and incubated with BMS-5/vehicle for 24 h. Cell were harvested and
assayed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were analyzed
on a BD Canto-II (Becton Dickinson and Co, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) ﬂow-
cytometer setting excitation and collection emission wavelength recom-
mended by the manufacturer. The ratio parameter was established using
BD FACSDiva 6.1.3 software as recommended by the manufacturer.

Proliferation assays
Cell proliferation was studied with two different techniques. Nf2DEx2 MSCs
were seeded in a 24-well format and had cell numbers assessed with the
Crystal Violet Assay as previously described.42 Absorbance at 595 nm was
measured with a mQuant plate reader (BioTek).

Rate of DNA synthesis was evaluated at 24 h with the Click-iT EdU
Microplate Assay (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). The assay was carried out
in 96- and 384-well plate formats following the manufacturer’s instructions
without
the Amplex UltraRed ampliﬁcation steps. 4’,6-Diamidino-2-
phenylindole stain was included in the wash after the reaction cocktail
incubation step. Oregon green-488 and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
ﬂuorescence was quantiﬁed by a plate reader.

Cell cycle analysis
The cell cycle was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry with PI staining and BrdU/
7AAD. Ethanol-ﬁxed cells (106) were PI stained using 500 ml PI/RNase
staining buffer (Beckton Dickinson). Samples were examined on a BD
Canto-II ﬂow cytometer, and histograms were analyzed using ModFit LT
software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME, USA). For each sample,
10 000 events were collected.

The BrdU/7AAD assay kit was from Beckton Dickinson. Cells were seeded
in six-well plates and treated with inhibitor/vehicle overnight. Next day,
cultures were incubated with 10 mM BrdU for 3 h, and the assay was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Samples were
analyzed with a BD Canto-II ﬂow cytometer using the BD FACSDiva 6.1.3
software. FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc, Ashland, OR, USA) was used for
analysis of acquired data.

Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA) was
used for statistical analysis and graph generation of experimental data
from three independent experiments. Dose–response experiments were
analyzed by nonlinear regression (four parameters). Statistical analysis is
indicated for each experiment.
