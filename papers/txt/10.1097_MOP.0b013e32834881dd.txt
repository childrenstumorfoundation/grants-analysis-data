Purpose of review
Recent advances in molecular genetic research have led to the deÔ¨Ånition of the new
group of genetic syndromes, the RAS‚Äìmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway disorders or ‚ÄòRASopathies‚Äô. They comprise Noonan syndrome and related
disorders (cardio-facio-cutaneous and Costello syndromes), as well as
neuroÔ¨Åbromatosis type 1. This review summarizes the recent literature with a special
focus on genotype‚Äìphenotype correlations.
Recent Ô¨Åndings
Although the picture is still incomplete, and additional genes are likely to exist, the
underlying genetic alteration can now be found in a large majority of patients with a
RASopathy phenotype. The most recently discovered novel genes for Noonan
syndrome or Noonan syndrome-like disorders, NRAS, SHOC2, and CBL, account for
small fractions of the patient population. The increasing knowledge about the spectrum
of gene mutations and associated clinical manifestations has led to a reÔ¨Ånement of
genotype‚Äìphenotype correlations. Recent studies have added new insights into tumor
predisposition and prenatal manifestations. Model systems are being developed to
investigate innovative treatment approaches.
Summary
Constitutional overactivation at various levels of the RAS‚ÄìMAPK pathway causes
overlapping syndromes, comprising characteristic facial features, cardiac defects,
cutaneous abnormalities, growth deÔ¨Åcit, neurocognitive delay, and predisposition to
malignancies. Each syndrome also exhibits unique features that probably reÔ¨Çect
genotype-related speciÔ¨Åc biological effects.

Introduction
During recent years, a new class of genetic diseases
has emerged that includes Noonan syndrome, one of
the most common monogenic disorders in humans,
and the clinically overlapping disorders such as car-
dio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) and Costello syndromes.
Although genetic studies have revealed an unforeseen
molecular and clinical heterogeneity of these disorders,
the common denominator is that all the involved genes
encode components or modulators of
the RAS‚Äì
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
[1,2,3]. This pathway also links Noonan syndrome
and related disorders to neuroÔ¨Åbromatosis type 1
(NF1). The entire group is subsumed under the term
RAS‚ÄìMAPK pathway disorders, neuro-facial-cardial-
cutaneous disorders, or RASopathies.

The RAS‚Äìmitogen-activated protein kinase
signaling pathway and its involvement in
tumorigenesis and developmental disorders
RAS-GTPases are ubiquitous molecules that act as central
molecular switches by cycling between an active GTP-
bound and an inactive GDP-bound form [4]. Through
association with RAF, GTP-bound RAS initiates an acti-
vation cascade of MAPKs (Fig. 1). The balance of RAS
activation and inactivation is Ô¨Ånely regulated. The RAS‚Äì
MAPK pathway is characterized by molecular redundancy
including several RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK (extracellu-
lar signal-regulated kinase) isoforms encoded by different
genes. RAS and RAF genes have long been known as proto-
oncogenes [5]. Somatic mutations in KRAS and BRAF
belong to the most common genetic alterations observed
in a variety of malignancies.

Figure 1 Signal
activated protein kinase pathway

transduction through the RAS‚Äìmitogen-

Upon recruitment to activated growth factor receptors, guanine nucleo-
tide exchange factors such as SOS1 activate RAS through facilitating
the exchange of GDP by GTP. GTP-bound RAS can initiate an activation
cascade of mitogen-activated protein kinases, RAF, MEK, and extra-
cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Restitution of RAS‚Äôs inactive state
is achieved by hydrolysis of GTP to GDP through the intrinsic GTPase
activity of RAS, which is augmented by GTPase-activating proteins such
as neuroÔ¨Åbromin (NF1). Thereby, NF1 acts as negative regulator of RAS
signaling. SHOC2 and SPRED1 are positive and negative modulators,
respectively, at the level of the RAS‚ÄìRAF interaction. CBL protein acts
as an ubiquitin (Ub) ligase that can recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated
substrates and, thereby, modulates receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated
signal transduction.

Both mutations that occur as somatic lesions in tumors, as
well as the germline changes associated with develop-
mental disorders, are considered to cause dysregulated
(i.e., overactive) RAS‚ÄìMAPK signaling [1,2]. Never-
theless, with few exceptions, their mutation spectra do
not overlap. It has been experimentally proven for several
mutant proteins [6,7,8] and is believed as a general
principle that mutations occurring in the germline cause
less dysregulation of the pathway, one that is capable of
perturbing developmental programs but unlikely to
promote tumorigenesis. In contrast, the typical somatic
oncogenic mutations result in stronger RAS‚ÄìMAPK
pathway overactivation that is thought to be lethal when
occurring in the germline.

Common phenotypic features of the
RASopathies
The phenotype of Noonan syndrome is prototypic for a
pattern of physical and developmental anomalies that
results from constitutional dysregulation of RAS‚ÄìMAPK
signaling. This pattern can be recognized in all RASo-
pathies, although individual symptoms may vary con-

siderably in their expression between the different enti-
ties. Congenital heart defects, short stature, and distinctive
craniofacial features are hallmarks of the Noonan syn-
drome/RASopathy phenotype [3]. The most typical heart
defects include valvular pulmonary stenosis often associ-
ated with valve dysplasia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM), and atrioventricular septal defects [9].

The abnormal growth pattern is characterized by nor-
mal or slightly subnormal measurements at birth, post-
natal decline in height standard deviation score and
often attenuated and delayed pubertal growth spurt,
which may lead to some catch-up growth in early
adulthood [10]. Adult height varies among different
entities. Head size is usually increased (relative or
absolute macrocephaly).

The typical craniofacial anomalies are illustrated in Fig. 2
[11]. The craniofacial features may be difÔ¨Åcult to appreci-
ate in newborns and become subtler during adolescence
[12].

Various additional anomalies occur frequently in RAS‚Äì
MAPK pathway disorders. They include lymphatic
anomalies that may result in a wide spectrum of postnatal
(lymphedema, chylothorax) or prenatal (see below) mani-
festations. A characteristic thorax shape is common (Fig. 3)
[11], as well as cryptorchidism in males. Ectodermal fea-
tures are variable and include dry skin with hyperkeratotic
changes (follicular hyperkeratosis, rarely palmar/plantar
hyperkeratosis), curly and/or sparse, slow-growing hair,
and pigmentary changes (cafe¬¥-au-lait macules, lentigines).

pathies [3]. The clinical phenotype of Noonan syndrome
has been the subject of several excellent
reviews
[13,14,15,16]. A brief synopsis is given in Table 1.

The various genetic etiologies of
RASopathies and genotype‚Äìphenotype
correlations
The search for genes responsible for Noonan syndrome
and related disorders started 10 years ago and has
revealed an unforeseen genetic heterogeneity [1,2,3].
The most recent discoveries identiÔ¨Åed SHOC2 [17],
NRAS [6], and CBL [18] as genes for rare cases of
Noonan syndrome or Noonan syndrome-like disorders.
Notably, the molecular genetic Ô¨Åndings have largely
conÔ¨Årmed and, at some points, reÔ¨Åned the established
nosology. Distinct clinical syndromes are caused by
mutations in speciÔ¨Åc genes or even by speciÔ¨Åc types of
mutations with only small areas of overlap (Table 2).
However, the following narrative is still a relatively crude
snapshot and we will probably learn about additional
genes and individual mutations associated with speciÔ¨Åc
phenotypic features in the future.

one-third show cognitive deÔ¨Åcits requiring special edu-
cation [13,14,15,16]. The average intelligence quotient
level in patients with Noonan syndrome is around 80‚Äì90
[19,20].

PTPN11 was the Ô¨Årst identiÔ¨Åed gene for Noonan syn-
drome [21] and is the most frequently mutated one,
accounting for 40‚Äì50% of cases. PTPN11 (OMIM
176876) encodes SHP2 and acts upstream of RAS (as
does SOS1), as depicted in Fig. 1. Patients carrying
PTPN11 mutations are more likely to have pulmonary
stenosis and less likely to have HCM [22,23]. Easy
bruising is more often observed in patients with PTPN11
mutations compared with other genotypes.

SOS1 mutations are responsible for 10‚Äì15% of cases with
Noonan syndrome [24,25]. These patients display a
similar spectrum of heart defects to patients with
PTPN11 mutations, but they are less likely to have short
stature and to require special education. Ectodermal
abnormalities (curly hair, sparse eyebrows, keratosis
pilaris) are more common in patients with mutated
SOS1 and may be reminiscent of CFC syndrome [26].

RAF1 mutations account for 5‚Äì8% of cases with Noonan
syndrome and are strongly associated with HCM [27,28].
Eighty to 95% of patients with RAF1 mutations have
HCM that may in some instances be associated with a
fatal course in infancy.

KRAS mutations are rare in Noonan syndrome (about 2‚Äì
3%) [7]. The associated phenotype is quite variable and
patients have been classiÔ¨Åed as having either Noonan or
CFC or even Costello syndrome [29]. Cognitive impair-
ment is more common in patients with KRAS mutations
than generally seen in Noonan syndrome. No clear cor-
relations between speciÔ¨Åc KRAS mutations and pheno-
typic classiÔ¨Åcations have emerged so far. NRAS mutations
account for fewer than 0.5% of cases with Noonan syn-
drome [6]. The few reported cases do not suggest any
speciÔ¨Åc phenotype.

BRAF and MEK1 mutations, which usually cause CFC
syndrome (see below), have exceptionally been reported
in Noonan syndrome [30,31]. There is some evidence
that certain BRAF and MEK1 mutations are associated
with a milder phenotype (particularly with milder cog-
nitive impairments), which is more likely to be classiÔ¨Åed
as Noonan syndrome [30‚Äì32]. Further genotype‚Äì
phenotype studies are required to support this notion.

Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines/LEOPARD
syndrome (OMIM 151100)
Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) is
the term that is now preferred over LEOPARD syn-
drome, which was coined as an acronym for multiple

RAS‚ÄìMAPK pathway disorders Zenker 447

lentigines, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ocular
hypertelorism, pulmonary valve stenosis, abnormal geni-
talia, retardation of growth, and deafness [33]. Although
young children with NSML are initially often diagnosed
with Noonan syndrome, the development of multiple
lentigines, which usually starts in childhood, allows dis-
tinguishing NSML from Noonan syndrome. Moreover,
patients with NSML more often have HCM (up to 80%)
than pulmonary stenosis (10‚Äì40%), and sensorineural
deafness occurs in 15‚Äì25%. The frequency and the level
of cognitive and growth deÔ¨Åcits appear to be similar to
Noonan syndrome [34].

In contrast

NSML is also genetically distinct from Noonan syn-
drome. SpeciÔ¨Åc PTPN11 mutations (mainly p.Y279C,
p.T486M) are responsible for the majority of NSML
cases.
to Noonan syndrome-associated
PTPN11 mutations, these changes result in reduced
catalytic activity of the gene product SHP2. Nonetheless,
NSML-associated PTPN11 alterations are obviously not
simple loss-of-function mutations leading to haploinsuf-
Ô¨Åciency. Dominant-negative effects have been proposed
[35] as well as gain-of-function effects that are indepen-
dent of SHP2 catalytic function [36‚Äì38]. Mutations in
RAF1 [27] and BRAF [32] have rarely been reported with
a NSML phenotype.

Noonan syndrome-like with loose anagen hair
(OMIM 607721)
A Noonan syndrome-like disorder with a characteristic
hair phenotype was recently proposed as a separate entity
by Mazzanti et al. [39]. The hair in these patients is easily
pluckable, sparse, thin, and slowly growing. Trichogram
from pull test usually shows the majority to be anagen
hairs. This syndrome is furthermore characterized by
diffuse skin hyperpigmentation, a typical spectrum of
heart defects (semilunar valve dysplasias and septal
defects overrepresented compared with pulmonary ste-
nosis and HCM), more severe growth deÔ¨Åcits frequently
associated with growth hormone deÔ¨Åciency, a higher
frequency of cognitive and behavioral issues, and recog-
nizable craniofacial features (Fig. 1c).

The Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen
hair has been found to be genetically homogeneous and
distinct. A single and functionally unique mutation in the
gene SHOC2, p.S2G, accounts for virtually all cases with
this speciÔ¨Åc phenotype [17].

Noonan syndrome-like disorder with juvenile
myelomonocytic leukemia (OMIM 613563)
Heterozygous germline mutations in the CBL gene have
simultaneously been discovered in patients with juvenile
myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and additional fea-
tures suggestive of an underlying developmental disorder

[40,41], as well as in a cohort with a Noonan syndrome
or a Noonan syndrome-like phenotype without hemato-
logic abnormalities [18]. The phenotype associated with
CBL mutations
relatively variable and includes
impaired growth, developmental delay, cryptorchidism
in males, and predisposition to JMML. CBL mutations
show incomplete penetrance, as evidenced by several
instances of inheritance of the disease-causing mutation
from an apparently healthy parent [18,40,41].

is

NeuroÔ¨Åbromatosis-Noonan syndrome (OMIM 601321)
The term neuroÔ¨Åbromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS)
was introduced for patients fulÔ¨Ålling clinical criteria for
NF1 [42] and additionally exhibiting typical manifes-
tations of Noonan syndrome (such as craniofacial
anomalies, short stature, and learning difÔ¨Åculties) [43].
The presence of the typical NF1-associated skin lesions
and tumors clearly distinguishes NFNS from Noonan
syndrome. Patients with NFNS usually carry mutations
in the NF1 gene. It has been postulated that speciÔ¨Åc
types of NF1 mutations might be overrepresented in
NFNS, suggesting genotype‚Äìphenotype correlations
[44]. Others speculated the NFNS phenotype might just
represent the extreme of a highly variable spectrum of
the expression of Noonan syndrome-like features in
patients with NF1 [45]. In fact, NF1 in general is quite
commonly associated with developmental anomalies that
Ô¨Åt into the spectrum of Noonan syndrome. These include
learning difÔ¨Åculties that affect more than half of NF1
patients [46,47], short stature (present in 20% [48]), and
even heart defects of the Noonan syndrome spectrum
that occur more frequently in NF1 than in the normal
population [49]. Facial anomalies reminiscent of Noonan
syndrome can be recognized in a considerable proportion
of NF1 patients [45,50]. It is assumed that all the devel-
opmental anomalies seen in patients with NF1 that
overlap those of the Noonan syndrome phenotype reÔ¨Çect
a slight but generalized dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK
pathway due to haploinsufÔ¨Åciency caused by the germ-
line mutation of one NF1 allele [45]. In contrast, pig-
mented skin lesions and the typical tumors, which
represent the main clinical criteria of NF1 [42], have
been shown to result from a somatic loss of function of
the second allele and clonal expansion of cells that are
completely devoid of neuroÔ¨Åbromin-induced inhibition
of the RAS-MAPK pathway [51].

Legius syndrome (OMIM 611431)
A NF1-like disorder that is characterized by multiple cafe¬¥-
au-lait spots but absence of NF1-associated tumors was
genetically elucidated in 2007 [52]. Affected individuals
may show some Noonan syndrome-like features such as
subtle craniofacial anomalies, learning difÔ¨Åculties, and
growth deÔ¨Åcit. The gene SPRED1 that causes Legius
syndrome encodes a negative regulator of the RAS‚Äì
MAPK pathway. Similarly to NF1, the SPRED1 germline

mutations cause loss of function, suggesting that the
Noonan syndrome-like features
reÔ¨Çect haploinsufÔ¨Å-
ciency.

Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (OMIM 115150)
CFC syndrome can be distinguished from Noonan syn-
drome mainly by a more severe cognitive impairment and
more prominent ectodermal anomalies [24,53]. The
cognitive abilities of the majority of patients fall in the
range of mild-to-severe mental retardation. Epilepsy
occurs in about half of the cases and various structural
brain abnormalities have been described [54]. Skin and
adnexal changes are present in virtually all patients with
CFC syndrome [55]. They include follicular hyperker-
atosis, sparse, slow-growing, curly hair, palmoplantar
hyperkeratosis at the pressure zones, and development
of multiple pigmented nevi. The spectrum of heart
defects is similar to that in Noonan syndrome.

CFC syndrome is caused by mutations in the genes
BRAF (50‚Äì60%), MEK1 (5‚Äì10%), MEK2 (5‚Äì10%), and
KRAS (3‚Äì5%) [56,57]. Preliminary genotype‚Äìphenotype
correlations among these genes that have been proposed
need to be further substantiated [53].

Costello syndrome (OMIM 218040)
Patients with Costello syndrome constitute a relatively
homogeneous group, genetically and clinically. It is now
widely accepted that the term Costello syndrome should
be reserved for patients with a HRAS mutation because of
the speciÔ¨Åc risk proÔ¨Åle of these patients [58]. More than
70% of patients with Costello syndrome harbor the same
HRAS mutation (p.G12S) [58,59].

Patients with Costello syndrome usually show severe
feeding problems in infancy. During childhood, the
patients develop coarser facial features than usually seen
in Noonan syndrome, which may suggest a storage dis-
order. Skin is soft and redundant with deep palmar and
plantar creases. Hair is sparse in early childhood and curly
thereafter. Epidermal warts or papillomata may occur.
Cognitive function is typically at the level of mild to
moderate mental retardation [60]. The most frequent
cardiac abnormalities are atrial tachycardia, HCM, and
pulmonary stenosis [61]. Notably, patients with Costello
syndrome are at increased tumor risk (15‚Äì25%) with
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, bladder carcinoma, and
neuroblastoma representing the most commonly reported
tumor entities [62].

New insights into tumor risk in Noonan
syndrome
The demonstration that germline mutations in com-
ponents of a central oncogenic pathway are responsible

possible increased tumor risk. In contrast to NF1 and
Costello syndrome, Noonan syndrome and the other
related disorders have not been generally regarded as
cancer predisposition disorders. In recent years, it has
become evident that certain rare tumors or tumor-like
lesions are speciÔ¨Åcally associated with RASopathies
[63,64]. JMML, a rare myeloproliferative disease of child-
hood, is associated with Noonan syndrome as well as
NF1, although the absolute prevalence in individuals
affected by either of these disorders is quite low (about
1‚Äì2%) [65]. SpeciÔ¨Åc mutations (e.g., PTPN11 p.T73I,
and mutations in the CBL gene) have been identiÔ¨Åed as
tumor risk genotypes for Noonan syndrome with JMML
[40,64]. Giant cell lesions affecting the jawbones or
joints (pigmented villonodular synovitis) are tumor-like
lesions that are also clearly associated with Noonan
syndrome and other RASopathies [66]. Moreover, there
is a large number of anecdotal reports on various types of
neoplasias in patients with Noonan syndrome. A very
recent comprehensive literature review identiÔ¨Åed neuro-
blastoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
low-grade
glioma, and rhabdomyosarcoma as the most commonly
reported tumors in Noonan syndrome [65]. A recently
published epidemiologic study from the Netherlands
calculated a 3.5-fold increased risk of cancer in patients
with Noonan syndrome and a PTPN11 mutation com-
pared with that in the general population [67]. Despite
various limitations of these studies, the current data
suggest that Noonan syndrome may be associated with
a broader spectrum of malignancies than previously
appreciated and a mildly increased overall cancer risk.
Larger epidemiologic studies are required to deÔ¨Åne more
precisely tumor spectrum and risk Ô¨Ågures. Current
knowledge does not warrant speciÔ¨Åc cancer surveillance
for patients with Noonan and CFC syndrome, but aware-
ness and a low threshold for additional investigations in
case of any unusual symptoms are appropriate.

Prenatal manifestations
Although many of the characteristic abnormalities deÔ¨Ån-
ing Noonan syndrome are undetectable in the fetus,
abnormal Ô¨Åndings during pregnancy are quite common.
The typical prenatal history includes fetal abnormalities
that range from fetal nuchal edema/cystic hygroma to
pleural effusions (chylothorax) and generalized hydrops.
The prevalence of such abnormalities in fetuses affected
by Noonan syndrome is not known, but, considering the
high frequency of a short and broad neck with excess
nuchal skin in newborns with RASopathies, it is tempting
to speculate that nuchal edema is a common feature of
affected fetuses. Pergament et al. [68] identiÔ¨Åed eight
cases of Noonan syndrome among 120 euploid fetuses
with increased nuchal translucency. Previously, Lee et al.
[69] even found PTPN11 mutations in 12 of 134 euploid
fetuses with abnormal ultrasound Ô¨Åndings of the above-

mentioned spectrum. Notably, the mutations observed in
three fetuses with hydrops fetalis from this cohort had
previously been reported as somatic cancer mutations,
thus providing preliminary insights into manifestations of
lethal RAS pathway mutations.

Future prospects regarding diagnosis and
management
Diagnosis of the aforementioned disorders is primarily
based on the recognition of the clinical phenotype and
can in most cases (60‚Äì80% depending on clinical criteria)
be conÔ¨Årmed by molecular genetic testing. Strategies
have been proposed to prioritize the genes to test based
on phenotypic criteria [15]. However, the emerging
new methods in genetic testing will probably soon over-
come these issues. With more differentiated knowledge
on genotype‚Äìphenotype correlations and pathophysiol-
ogy, molecular genetic testing may become more useful
not only for conÔ¨Årmation of the clinical diagnosis but also
for prognostic estimation and management.

Current treatment options for RASopathies are solely
symptomatic. Multidisciplinary management and a life-
long follow-up for late manifestations and complications
are basic elements of the published management recom-
mendations [15,53,58]. Medical treatment approaches
using compounds that compensate the consequences of
disturbed RAS-mediated signaling have successfully
been used in animal and in-vitro models to target cog-
nitive impairment [70,71] and HCM [72,73]. Treat-
ment studies on humans are awaited.

Conclusion
The diseases caused by mutations in RAS and related
intracellular signal transduction factors include relatively
common monogenic disorders and range from mild con-
ditions that may only marginally affect life quality and
expectancy to severely disabling syndromes. Their com-
mon pathophysiological denominator is constitutional
dysregulation of the RAS‚ÄìMAPK pathway, which may
result from mutations in multiple genes. Translation of
these genetic Ô¨Åndings into clinical applications is creating
a very exciting new area of research. The improved
understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms
