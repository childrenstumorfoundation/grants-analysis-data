Background. Patients with Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 (NF1) have
an increased risk of developing tumors of the central and peripheral
nervous system, including plexiform neuroﬁbromas (PN), which are
benign nerve sheath tumors that are among the most debilitating
complications of NF1. There are no standard treatment options for PN
other than surgery, which is often difﬁcult due to the extensive growth
and invasion of surrounding tissues. Mammalian Target of Rapam-
cyin (mTOR) acts as a master switch of cellular catabolism and
anabolism and controls protein translation, angiogenesis, cell
motility, and proliferation. The NF1 tumor suppressor, neuro-
ﬁbromin, regulates the mTOR pathway activity. Sirolimus is a
macrolide antibiotic that inhibits mTOR activity. Procedure. We
conducted a 2-stratum phase II clinical trial. In stratum 2, we sought
to determine whether the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus in subjects with

life questionnaires

NF1 results in objective radiographic responses in inoperable PNs in
the absence of documented radiographic progression at trial entry.
Results. No subjects had better than stable disease by the end of six
courses. However, the children’s self-report responses on health-
related quality of
indicated a signiﬁcant
improvement in the mean scores of the Emotional and School
domains from baseline to 6 months of sirolimus. Conclusions. This
study efﬁciently documented that sirolimus does not cause shrinkage
of non-progressive PNs, and thus should not be considered as a
treatment option for these tumors. This study also supports the
inclusion of patient-reported outcome measures in clinical trials to
assess areas of beneﬁt
that are not addressed by the medical
outcomes. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014;61:982–986.

INTRODUCTION

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal
dominant disorder with an incidence of 1:3,000 worldwide
(>80,000 persons affected in the United States alone). NF1 is
caused by a germline mutation in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene
located on chromosome 17q11.2. Patients with NF1 have an
increased risk of developing tumors of the central and peripheral
nervous system including plexiform neuroﬁbromas (PN) [1,2].

PNs are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that grow along
the length of nerves, and involve multiple fascicles and branches of
a nerve. These tumors are usually diagnosed early in life, may be
multiple in number, and can grow throughout life, though early
childhood is considered to be the period of greatest risk for disease
progression [3,4]. Between 20–44% of individuals with NF1
develop PNs [5–7]. While considered “benign,” these tumors may
cause signiﬁcant disﬁgurement, as well as compression of vital
structures. For example, PNs may inﬁltrate the orbit and are
associated with orbital dysplasia, displace the globe and compro-
mise vision; paraspinal tumors can compress the spinal cord and
cause paralysis; tumors in the mediastinum may compress the
trachea or great vessels; and tumors of the extremities can cause
progressive neurologic deﬁcit and signiﬁcant pain [3,8], all of
which can impair daily functioning and quality of life (QOL). The
management of PNs is difﬁcult, and currently, there is no acceptable
effective drug therapy. Thus, the only curative management is
surgical resection. However, resection is challenging due to the
inﬁltrating nature of the tumors and their signiﬁcant vascularity. In
addition, there is a high risk of tumor progression after the ﬁrst
surgery [3,9].

There is a great need for the development of targeted therapies
for inoperable PN in NF1. The NF1 tumor suppressor, neuro-
ﬁbromin, regulates mTOR pathway activity, which is activated in
NF1-deﬁcent cells and tumors from NF1 patients [10,11]. mTOR is
a serine/threonine kinase that acts as a central integrator of many

cellular functions, including cell size/growth, proliferation via
modulation of cell cycle transit, survival, translation, metabolism,
autophagy, angiogenesis, and aging; it does so by responding to the
availability of nutrients, glucose, and amino acids, as well as growth
factors and stress signals from the microenvironment [12]. mTOR
regulates these processes in part by controlling the protein
translation machinery [13], which increases the synthesis of
nutrient and amino acids transporters as well as key pro-growth
and survival molecules, such as HIF-1a, cyclin D1, and myc [14].
Sirolimus, an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1, is an effective
immunosuppressant, currently FDA-approved as an anti-rejection
medication for solid organ and bone marrow transplant [15]. Dosing
in young children is both well established and safe over long
periods. Recent studies have demonstrated that the NF1 tumor
suppressor regulates mTOR pathway activation and that abrogating

the activity of this pathway by inhibiting mTOR function reduces
tumor proliferation in Nf1 genetically engineered mouse models
and human NF1-associated tumor explants [10,16,17].

To explore the role of mTOR inhibition in the treatment of
NF1-associated plexiform neuroﬁbroma, we conducted a 2-strata
phase II clinical trial. We sought to determine whether the mTOR
inhibitor sirolimus in subjects with NF1 either (a) increases time to
progression (TTP) in progressive PN (stratum 1) or (b) results in
objective radiographic responses in inoperable PNs in the absence
of documented radiographic progression at trial entry (stratum 2).
Herein we report the results of subjects enrolled in Stratum 2.
Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis conducted
at regular intervals was used to determine response or progression
relative to baseline imaging. We also evaluated the effects of
treatment with sirolimus on pain and QOL using patient-reported
outcome (PRO) measures.

METHODS

Study Design and Population

Subjects were enrolled at one of nine Department of Defense
funded NF Clinical Consortium sites. Inclusion criteria included

age 3 years with a diagnosis of NF1 and an unresectable PN with

the potential to cause signiﬁcant morbidity, such as (but not limited
to) head and neck lesions that could compromise the airway or great
vessels, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that could cause nerve
compression and loss of function, lesions that could result in major
deformity, lesions of the extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or
loss of function, and painful lesions. Subjects with paraspinal PNs
were eligible for this trial. Histologic conﬁrmation of the tumor was
not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and imaging
ﬁndings. PNs had to be amenable to volumetric MRI analysis.
Subjects may have been previously treated, but must have recovered
from the acute toxic effects of all therapy. Other eligibility criteria
included (a) adequate performance status (Lansky score of 50 or
more); (b) normal blood count and renal, liver, and cardiac function;
and (c) signed informed consent from the patient, parent, or
guardian, according to institutional
review board guidelines.
Subjects with progressive PN (deﬁned as a new PN or based on

volumetric [20% in volume], area [13% in product of two
longest perpendicular diameters], or linear [6% in longest

diameter] increase in PN size on two MRI scans done within 1
year) were enrolled on Stratum 1. All other eligible subjects without
evidence of progression, which included three subjects followed for
less than 1 year, were enrolled on Stratum 2.

Subjects were excluded if they (a) had received prior therapy
with an mTOR inhibitor; (b) had evidence of a tumor or cancer
requiring treatment with chemotherapy or radiation; (c) were post-
pubertal males/females who would not agree to use effective
contraception, or were pregnant/breast-feeding females; (d) had a
known history of HIV or immunodeﬁciency; (e) had impairment of
gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that signiﬁcant-
ly alters the absorption of sirolimus; (f) had dental braces or
prosthesis that
interfere with volumetric analysis; or (g) had
concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease. In subjects
who had received therapy prior to study enrollment, 2 weeks-6
months must have elapsed, depending on the speciﬁc prior therapy.
Corticosteroid use was not allowed while on study, nor was the use
of strong CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors.

Sirolimus for Plexiform Neurofibromas in NF1

983

Therapy

The starting dose of sirolimus (1 ml¼ 1 mg) was 0.8 mg/m2 by

mouth twice daily. The starting dose was based on extrapolation of
the recommended sirolimus dose in older children and adult
transplant recipients [18]. Subsequent dosing was pharmacokineti-
cally guided to achieve a trough blood concentration of 10–15 ng/ml;
this target range was based on an effective sirolimus target reported
in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-associated
subependymal giant cell astrocytoma [19]. The ﬁrst sirolimus
concentration measurement was performed at steady-state follow-
ing 7–10 days of treatment. Subsequent trough concentrations were
obtained every 2 weeks until stable, which was deﬁned as two
consecutive trough concentrations between 10 and 15 ng/ml. Once
the dose was stable, trough concentrations were measured every

course (course¼ 28 days).

Sirolimus whole blood concentrations were centrally deter-
mined by a validated tandem mass spectrometry assay, as
previously described [20]. Lab results were reported using a
web-based protocol management
tool, and included real-time
dosing recommendations generated with a Bayesian estimator
(MW/Pharm version 3.6, Mediware, Groningen, Netherlands) [20].
The system automatically generated email notiﬁcations to the
clinical teams, which included the recording of acceptance of
dosing adjustments.

The pediatric population parameter estimates for PK-guided
dosing were derived from published pharmacokinetic data in stable
renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus [20]. The patient
demographics, dosing and concentration-time data sets entered into
the MW/Pharm program were used for the Bayesian estimation.

On Study Evaluations

Subjects had non-contrast axial and coronal STIR MRI obtained
at enrollment and after every three courses until course nine, then
after every six courses of therapy. Volumetric analysis was
performed centrally at the NCI, as previously reported [4,21].
Subjects who did not experience a partial response to sirolimus after
six courses were removed from protocol therapy. Toxicity was
monitored with a physical examination and laboratory studies
(including blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel)
monthly for the ﬁrst three courses, then every three courses. Those
subjects who consented (and their parents if they were <18 years
old) also completed assessments of health-related QOL and pain
intensity at the same interval of MRI testing using the following
methods.

PRO Measures

General health-related quality of

life (HRQOL). The
PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales is a reliable and valid 23-item
questionnaire assessing four domains (physical, emotional, social,
and school functioning) of HRQOL in children 3 years old through
adults [22,23]. Subjects, ages 5–25 years, completed the self-report
forms and the parents of children, ages 3–18 years, were
administered the parent proxy form. Items rated on a ﬁve-point
Likert scale (0–4) are transformed to a 0–100 scale, and higher
domain and total mean raw scores indicate better QOL. The
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) is a
reliable and valid 27-item measure of general HRQOL, assessing 4
generic core subscales (physical, emotional, social, and functional

984

Weiss et al.

well-being) in adults 25 years and older with cancer and other
chronic illnesses [24,25]. Items are rated on a ﬁve-point Likert scale

(0–4), and higher subscale and total T-scores (Mean¼ 50; SD¼ 10)

indicate better QOL.

Pain intensity. Parents and children from 5 to 18 years of age
independently rated the intensity of the child’s worst pain during the
past week on the visual analogue scale (VAS) from the PedsQL
Pediatric Pain Questionnaire [26]. This VAS consists of a happy
face and “no pain” written on the left end of the line and a sad face
and “severe pain” written on the right end. The child or parent is
instructed to put a mark on the line that indicates how much pain the
child is feeling. Adults, ages 18 years and older, rated the intensity
of their worst pain during the past week on the VAS from the Short-
Form McGill Pain Questionnaire [27]. Similar to the PedsQL VAS,
the McGill VAS consists of a line with “no pain” written at the left
end of the line and “worst possible pain” at the right end. For both of
these scales, the score is the distance of the mark from the left end of
the line, measured in millimeters (0–100 mm). Higher scores
indicate greater pain intensity. VAS ratings are reliable and valid
measures of pain intensity in both children [28] and adults [29].

Response and Toxicity

For

response determination, volumetric measurements on
follow-up scans were compared to the pretreatment PN volume.
Complete Response (CR) was deﬁned as complete resolution of all

measurable PNs. Partial Response (PR) was deﬁned as a 20%

reduction in the sum of the volume of all index PN lesions, while
Stable Disease (SD) was deﬁned as <20% increase and <20%
decrease in the sum of the volume of all index PN lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD) was deﬁned as 20% increase in the

volume of at least one of the index PN lesions compared to
the pretreatment volume measured. The appearance of new discrete
subcutaneous neuroﬁbromas did not qualify for disease progres-
sion, nor did the occurrence of new or increased symptoms without
MRI evidence for progression. Subjects who completed at least one
course of therapy were considered evaluable for response.

Toxicity was monitored using CTCAE version 3. Subjects were

considered evaluable for toxicity if they received  one dose of

sirolimus and had a “severe” sirolimus-associated toxicity or, in the
absence of a “severe” toxicity, completed one full course of therapy.
Severe sirolimus toxicity was deﬁned as any of the following
toxicities identiﬁed during the ﬁrst
opportunistic infection/pneumocysitis jiroveci pneumonia, Grade

two courses: Grade 3
2 pneumonitis, Grade 4 rash, Grade 3 hypertension, Grade 3

allergic reaction, worsening renal function, or the development of
lymphoma or other cancers.

Statistical Analysis

An optimal Simon two stage design with a null response rate of
0.05 and an alternative of 0.20 was used. The type 1 and type 2 error
rates were both set at 0.10. This called for a ﬁrst stage sample size of
12 with an additional 25 to be accrued if any of these 12 achieved at
least partial response. In that case, sirolimus would be deemed
effective if four or more of the 37 achieved at least a partial
response.

The general QOL and VAS pain data were summarized with
descriptive statistics (means, SD, and ranges). Paired t-tests were
used to assess change, from the baseline to ﬁnal PRO evaluation at

Pediatr Blood Cancer DOI 10.1002/pbc

course 6, in the mean scores of the child self-report and parent proxy
PedsQL, adult self-report FACT-G, and the overall ratings of
pain on the Visual Analog Scales. Due to the small sample size,
the number of subjects who demonstrated stable functioning
(<5 points) and clinically meaningful improvement or decline
(5 points) in their individual HRQOL (PedsQL or FACT-G)

scores [30–32] was presented. On the VAS, the number of subjects
who showed stable or clinically meaningful change of at least
30 mm in their ratings of pain intensity also was noted [33,34].

RESULTS

Subject Characteristics

Of the 13 subjects enrolled on Stratum 2 (mean age 16 years,
range 3–35 years; Table I), one subject withdrew consent and never
took study drug; therefore, a total of 12 subjects were evaluable for
response or toxicity. While lack of progression was documented in
all subjects at enrollment, three subjects had an observation period
with PN measurements for less than 12 months. Eleven subjects
signed consent to participate in the PRO studies evaluating QOL
and pain. Of these, six children and their parents completed the
PedsQL QOL scale and the pain VAS (one child was too young for
the self-report form and had disease progression prior to course 3,
and one subject had incomplete follow-up data), and three adults
completed the FACT-G QOL scale and the McGill pain VAS at
baseline and course 6. Thus, nine subjects (six children mean
range 5–17 years and three adults mean

age¼ 11.0 years;
age¼ 29.3 years; range 25–34 years) had complete PRO data.

Outcomes

No subjects had better than SD by the end of course 6 (Table II).
One subject had documented PD. All subjects achieved target
concentration by course 3 (mean 2.1 courses; range 1–3 courses).
By design, since none of the ﬁrst 12 subjects had a response by
course 6, this stratum was closed without rejection of the null
hypothesis.

General QOL. For the children (n¼ 6) who completed the

PedsQL self-report form, there was no signiﬁcant change in the
mean Total Scores from baseline to course 6 (60.15–71.56; mean

domain indicated no change in the mean Physical (68.75–79.17;

change¼ 11.41;
t¼ 1.74, P¼ 0.14). Examining each child’s
individual data, three had stable Total Scores (<5 points change)
and three had scores that improved 5 points. Analyses of each
mean change¼ 10.42;
t¼ 1.29, P¼ 0.2545) or Social (58.33–
59.17; mean change¼ 0.83; t¼ 0.044, P¼ 0.9669) Domain Scores
74.17; mean change¼ 18.33; t¼ 2.86, P¼ 0.0354) and School
(52.50–69.17; mean change¼ 16.67; t¼ 4.663, P¼ 0.0055) Do-

from baseline to 6 months. However, the mean Emotional (55.83–

main Scores showed a signiﬁcant increase at 6 months. Examina-
tion of individual scores in these two domains indicated that ﬁve
children’s scores improved in the Emotional Domain (one subject’s
score was stable), while all six children’s scores improved in the
School Domain.

For the parents who completed the PedsQL proxy form about
their child’s QOL at baseline and after course 6, there was no
signiﬁcant change in the mean Total Scores (63.10–61.23; mean

Domain Scores. Examining the individual scores, three parent

change¼ 1.88; t¼ 0.7076, P¼ 0.5108) or any of the mean
proxy Total Scores were stable, two declined 5 points, and one
improved 5 points.

For the three adults completing the FACT-G, there was no
signiﬁcant difference in mean Total Scores from baseline to course

6 (45.33–41.47; mean change¼ 3.87; t¼ 1.73, P¼ 0.2264) or

any of the Domain Scores. Examining the individual FACT-G Total
Scores, two adults showed improvement and one had a decline
(all > 5 points).

Pain Intensity. At baseline, seven out of the nine subjects
rated some level of pain on the VAS. There was no signiﬁcant
change from baseline to course 6 in the mean pain ratings of these

nine subjects (43.72–36.93; mean change¼ 6.79; P¼ 0.5699) or
of the six parents (51.52–35.39; mean change¼ 16.13; t¼ .79,
P¼ 0.4655) completing the VAS on their child. A review of the

individual pain ratings found that from baseline to 6 months, three
subjects had a clinically meaningful decrease and one had an
increase of at least 30 mm while ﬁve remained stable. For the

parents, two rated their child’s pain as decreasing, one as increasing,
and three as stable over the 6 months.

Toxicity

None of the subjects developed severe sirolimus toxicity, and
none of the subjects required a target level reduction due to toxicity.
One subject developed Grade 3 diarrhea in course 3 at least possibly
related to sirolimus, which fully resolved. Other toxicities at least
possibly related to sirolimus included triglyceride elevation in one
subject, hypertension in one subject, headache in two subjects,
cytopenia in two subjects, and moderate mucositis in four subjects
(33%), all of which resolved while continuing sirolimus.

DISCUSSION

three courses;

In 12 subjects, the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus, dosed twice daily
to achieve a target blood level of 10–15 ng/ml, did not shrink non-
progressive NF1-associated PNs after six courses of therapy.
Sirolimus was tolerable in subjects with NF1 at doses similar to
those administered in the transplant setting, and no subjects had
target reductions due to toxicity. While the treatment duration was
relatively short, target sirolimus concentrations were achieved in all
subjects after
inadequate sirolimus
concentrations are not a potential reason for sirolimus inactivity.
The lack of PN shrinkage in our trial is consistent with a recently
described preclinical mouse neuroﬁbroma model where adminis-
tration of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 did not result in tumor
shrinkage [35]. In contrast, in a genetic NF1 MPNST mouse model
mTOR inhibition resulted in substantial delay of tumor progres-
sion [36]. Whether sirolimus will prolong time to progression in
those patients with progressive PNs at study entry is the subject of
the other stratum on this study. That stratum has recently closed to
accrual, and the results will be presented in a future publication.

therefore,

This study used PRO measures to assess the clinical effects of
sirolimus. In our small sample, no consistent group changes were
demonstrated in pain intensity VAS ratings or overall QOL scores as
reported by children, adults, or parents. However, the children’s
self-report measures, completed separately at baseline and after
6 months of sirolimus, indicated a signiﬁcant improvement in the
mean scores of the Emotional and School domains. Interestingly, a
study evaluating the effects of tipifarnib, a farnesyltransferase
inhibitor, in children with NF1 and PNs also found a signiﬁcant
improvement in the emotional domain scores as well as an upward
trend in the cognitive domain scores of the Impact of Pediatric
Illness Scale as rated by parents in the treatment arm compared to
the placebo arm (Widemann, submitted). It
is possible that
sirolimus, and other drugs acting on the RAS pathway, may affect
emotional and cognitive functioning. Evidence from both ani-
mal [37] and human studies [38] has shown that sirolimus may
decrease depressive-like behavior and enhance learning and
memory, possibly through the stimulation of major monoamine
pathways in the brain [37]. Due to the small sample size, caution
should be used in interpreting these preliminary PRO results, and
additional studies will be required to further investigate this
hypothesis. This study also supports the inclusion of PRO measures
in clinical trials to assess areas of beneﬁt that are not addressed by
the medical outcomes [39].

This ﬁrst NF Clinical Trials Consortium study directed at PNs
efﬁciently documented that sirolimus does not cause shrinkage of

986

Weiss et al.

non-progressive PNs, and thus should not be considered as a
treatment option for these tumors. Centralized volumetric MRI
analysis allowed for sensitive measurement of PN volumes and can
be incorporated in future trials with agents when shrinkage as drug
effect is considered possible. Analysis of the effect of sirolimus on
time to disease progression in progressive NF1 PNs is ongoing.
