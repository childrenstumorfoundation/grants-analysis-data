ABSTRACT: In 5-10% of patients, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results from microdeletions that 
encompass  the  entire  NF1  gene  and  a  variable  number  of  flanking  genes.  Two  recurrent 
microdeletion types are found in most cases, with microdeletion breakpoints located in paralogous 
regions  flanking  NF1  (proximal  NF1-REP-a  and  distal  NF1-REP–c  for  the  1.4  Mb  type-1 
microdeletion,  and  SUZ12  and  SUZ12P  for  the  1.2  Mb  type-2  microdeletion).  A  more  severe 
phenotype  is  usually  associated  with  NF1  microdeletion  patients  than  in  those  with  intragenic 
mutations. We characterized NF1 microdeletions in 70 unrelated NF1 microdeleted patients using a 
high-resolution  NF1  custom  array  comparative  genomic  hybridization  (CGH).  Genotype-
phenotype  correlations  were  studied  in  58  of  these  microdeletion  patients  and  compared  to  389 
patients with intragenic truncating NF1 mutations and phenotyped in the same standardized way. 
Our results confirmed in an unbiased manner the existence of a contiguous gene syndrome with a

INTRODUCTION 

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; MIM# 162200) is an autosomal disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 
3500 live births (Carey et al., 1986). NF1 is due to autosomal dominant loss-of-function mutations of the NF1 gene 
(neurofibromin 1; NM_000267), a tumour suppressor gene located at 17q11.2 and containing 60 translated exons 
distributed  over  ~300  kb.  In  5-10%  of  patients,  NF1  is  caused  by  genomic  microdeletions  that  encompass  the 
entire NF1 gene and a variable number of immediately flanking genes (Kluwe et al., 2004). The majority of such 
NF1 patients have one of two recurrent types: type-1 and type-2 microdeletions. The typical type-1 microdeletion 
is  1.4  Mb  long,  contains  NF1  and  at  least  14  additional  protein-coding  genes,  four  pseudogenes  and  two 
microRNAs  (Supp.  Figure  S1)  and  is  caused  by  non-allelic  homologous  recombination  (NAHR)  between 
paralogous sequences flanking the NF1 gene: the NF1 proximal and distal low-copy repeats (LCRs): NF1-REP-a 
and NF1-REP-c (Dorchner et al., 2000; López Correa et al., 2000; Jenne et al., 2001, 2003; Forbes et al., 2004; 
Raedt et al., 2006). The typical type-2 microdeletion is smaller (1.2 Mb) and has breakpoints located in the SUZ12 
gene  (suppressor  of  zeste  12  homolog;  NM_015355)  and  its  pseudogene  SUZ12P  (Petek  et  al.,  2003;  Kehrer-
Sawatzki et al., 2004; Steinmann et al., 2007; Roehl et al., 2010). Even less frequent, atypical NF1 microdeletions 
with  non-recurring  breakpoints  have  also  been  reported  (Riva  et  al.,  2000;  Kehrer-Sawatzki  et  al.,  2003,  2008; 
Venturin et al., 2004a; Mantripragada et al., 2006; Pasmant et al., 2008). 

The main features of NF1 include multiple café-au-lait (CAL) spots, skin-fold  freckling, Lisch nodules, and 
benign  peripheral  nerve  sheath  tumours  (dermal  and  plexiform  neurofibromas)  whose  occurrence,  number,  and 
size vary greatly from one patient to another, even from within the same NF1 family (Friedman, 1999). More than 
half  of  NF1  patients  will  also  develop  plexiform  neurofibromas,  of  which  about  5-10%  will  progress  into  a 
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) (Evans et al., 2002). 

While  NF1  represents  a  simply  determined  Mendelian  disorder  with  complete  penetrance,  it  is  however 
characterized  by  highly  variable  expressivity  in  both  the  number  of  major  features  and  the  occurrence  of 
complications (Friedman, 1999; Sabbagh et al., 2009). A more severe clinical phenotype has been reported in NF1 
patients carrying genomic  microdeletions that involve the entire NF1 gene, compare to patients with intragenic 
NF1 mutations. This contiguous gene syndrome does appear to include dysmorphic features (Upadhyaya et al., 
1998; López Correa et al., 1999, 2000; Streubel et al., 1999; Riva et al., 2000; Castle et al., 2003; Venturin et al., 
2004b), learning disabilities (Tonsgard et al., 1997; Upadhyaya et al., 1998; Korf et al., 1999; López Correa et al., 
1999, 2000; Streubel et al., 1999; Riva et al., 2000; Castle et al., 2003; Descheemaeker et al., 2004; Venturin et al., 
2004b),  cardiovascular  malformations  (Riva  et  al.,  2000;  Venturin  et  al.,  2004b,  2005;  Mensink  et  al.,  2006), 
childhood overgrowth (Spiegel et al., 2005), a higher tumour burden and earlier onset of benign neurofibromas 
(Leppig et al., 1997; López Correa et al., 2000; Castle et al., 2003), and probably, a higher incidence of MPNSTs 
(De  Raedt  et  al.,  2003)  and  other  malignancies  (López  Correa  et  al.,  2000).  While  many  reports  of  NF1 
microdeleted patients (currently > 150 cases) (Mensink et al., 2006) have been published since the initial study in 
1992 (Kayes et al., 1992), to date, little is known about this genotype-phenotype correlation. The limited number 
of microdeletions characterized per study, the imprecise definition of their boundaries, and the lack of appropriate 
control patients, had made it difficult to establish reliable genotype-phenotype correlations. 

To further explore the different NF1 locus rearrangements, and the putative association with such a contiguous 
gene  syndrome  phenotype,  a  large  cohort  of  70  unrelated  NF1  microdeleted  patients  was  studied.  Their 
microdeletions  were  accurately  characterized  using  a  high-resolution  NF1  custom  array  comparative  genomic 
hybridization  (CGH)  targeting  the  17q11.2  region.  The  genotype-phenotype  correlation  in  58  of  these 
microdeletion  patients  was  statistically  evaluated,  taking  389  unrelated  patients  with  intragenic  NF1  truncating 

E1508  Pasmant et al. 

mutations  as  a  reference  group.  All  NF1  patients  were  clinically  assessed  utilising  the  same  standardized 
questionnaire  collection  protocol.  Our  results  demonstrate  that  NF1  microdeletion  patients  have  a  significantly 
higher incidence of learning disabilities and facial dysmorphism than patients with intragenic NF1 mutation, after 
adjusting for age and sex. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Study samples 

A initial panel of 21 NF1 microdeleted patients was identified through a comprehensive mutation screening of 
561 NF1 index cases, enrolled between 2002 and 2005 in the French Clinical Research Program entitled “Study of 
expressivity  of  neurofibromatosis  1:  constitution  of  a  phenotype-genotype  database”  (coordinator:  Pr.  P. 
Wolkenstein,  Henri  Mondor  Hospital,  Créteil,  France)  to  constitute  the  so-called  ‘NF-France  database’,  as 
previously described (Sabbagh et al. 2008). The mutation screening of the NF1 gene was performed using a variety 
of NF1 gene screening methodologies that included, DNA and RNA sequencing, for small lesions, polymorphic 
microsatellite  marker analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or real-time PCR-
based  gene-dosage  analysis  to  permit  microdeletion  assessment,  as  previously  described  (Pasmant  et  al.,  2008; 
Upadhyaya et al., 2008). Among the 561 NF1 index cases, 512 individuals presented a NF1 alteration, 2 showed a 
SPRED1 (sprouty-related, EVH1 domain containing 1; NM_152594) mutation, and no NF1 and SPRED1 mutation 
was identified in the 47 remaining patients, as previously described (Pasmant et al., 2009b). Among the 512 index 
cases with a fully characterized NF1 mutation, 21 patients (4%) presented a NF1 microdeletion, in accordance with 
previous data (Kluwe et al., 2004). A second cohort of 49 NF1 microdeleted patients was selected from routine 
NF1 genotyping at Beaujon Hospital (Clichy, France) and at Institute of Medical Genetics (Cardiff, UK).  

In  total,  70  unrelated  NF1  patients  harbouring  a  NF1  microdeletion  were  included  in  this  present  study,  of 
which 50 patients (79%) had a de novo microdeletion and 13 patients (21%) had inherited their microdeletion. 
Relevant inheritance data was unavailable for the remaining 7 patients. 

The reference control group for this genotype-phenotype correlation study involved the use of non-deleted NF1 
patients  with  characterized  NF1  intragenic  truncating  mutations  selected  from  the  NF-France  database.  Only 
patients  with  constitutional  NF1  nonsense  or  frameshift  mutations  were  included  as  it  is  assumed  all  such 
mutations would lead to the premature truncation of neurofibromin. A total of 389 NF1 patients met this criterion 
and  were  included  in  the  reference  group  of  non-deleted  patients.  Patients  with  missense  mutations,  in-frame 
deletions  or  insertions  were  excluded  from  analyses  since  the  functional  consequences  of  such  mutations  are 
difficult to assess without functional studies. The 389 patients NF1 molecular alterations were characterized in the 
same laboratory (Beaujon Hospital, Clichy, France). 

For the 70 microdeleted and 389 non-deleted NF1 patients, the full clinical available information was recorded 
utilising a standardized questionnaire. All patients included in this study fulfilled the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) diagnostic criteria for NF1 (Ferner et al., 2007) and their written informed consent was obtained. 

Phenotypes 

Fourteen major clinical features of NF1 were selected for consideration for the genotype-phenotype association 
study,  as  previously  described  (Sabbagh  et  al.,  2008).  Four  were  quantitative  traits:  number  of  CAL  spots  (a 
continuous variable), number of plexiform neurofibromas (a continuous variable), and number of cutaneous and 
subcutaneous neurofibromas (each classified into one of four semi quantitative categories based on the number of 
neurofibromas:  0,  1–9,  10–99  and  ≥  100).  The  other  ten  clinical  features  were  coded  as  binary  variables: 
presence/absence of skin-fold freckling, blue-red macules, Lisch nodules, macrocephaly, childhood overgrowth, 
facial dysmorphism, scoliosis, learning disabilities, optic gliomas, and MPNST development. Patients with missing 
data  for  a particular  feature were  coded  as  “unknown”,  and were  not  then  considered  in  models  involving  that 
feature. Most features were identified by physical examination, with Lisch nodules being diagnosed, or excluded, 
by slit-lamp examination; individuals not given a slit lamp examination were coded as “unknown”. The presence 
or absence of optic gliomas was determined by cranial MRI or CT examination with individuals not given cranial 
imaging being coded as “unknown”. Childhood overgrowth was evaluated only in NF1 patients under the age of 
18 and was defined as height and/or head circumference at least two standard deviations above the age- and sex-
matched  population  mean.  A  facial  dysmorphism  was  diagnosed  if  two  or  more  of  the  following  signs  were

observed: coarse face, flat occiput/brachycephaly, facial asymmetry, prominent forehead, frontal bossing, ptosis, 
downslanting deep set eyes, eversion of the lateral eyelid, epicanthic folds, high and broad nasal bridge, bulbous 
nasal tip, large and low set ears, malar hypoplasia, wide and prominent philtrum, micrognathia, small pointed chin 
and low posterior hairline. For scoliosis, only scoliotic curves of >10° were taken into account in our analysis. The 
diagnosis of learning disabilities was performed on specific testing of cognitive abilities and/or history of scholar 
difficulties leading to repeating at least one level. Learning deficits most frequently involved visual spatial, visual 
motor integration skills and language-based skills. The prevalence of many other clinical abnormalities (epilepsy, 
hydrocephalus,  medullary  compression  by  neurofibroma,  cerebrovascular  complications,  renal  artery  stenosis, 
pseudoarthrosis,  congenital  pseudarthrosis  of  the  tibia,  dysplastic  vertebrae,  sphenoid  wing  dysplasia, 
xanthogranuloma) were too low (≤ 5%) for meaningful statistical analysis.  

The  70  microdeletion  and  the  389  control  patients’  phenotypes,  collected  through  a  standardized  NF1 
questionnaire  have  been  deposited  in  NCBI's  Gene  Expression  Omnibus  (GEO)  (Edgar  et  al.,  2002)  and  are

Characterization of NF1 microdeletions  

The  70  NF1  patients’  microdeletions  were  accurately  characterized  by  using  a  custom  high-resolution 
oligonucleotide array-CGH targeting the 17q11.2 region. The theoretical (design) and practical aspects (procedure) 
of this custom array-CGH are described in detail elsewhere (Pasmant et al., 2009a). Briefly, we designed a specific 
array-CGH  for  the  NF1  gene  and  its  flanking  regions  by  using  the  custom  Agilent  Human  Genome  15K 
Microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The array comprised a total of 14,207 oligonucleotide 
probes spanning the whole of chromosome 17, including 12 314 probes spanning a ~8 Mb interval surrounding the 
NF1  locus  (~300  kb).  This  8-Mb  interval  spanned  the  NF1  gene  region  and  included  the  largest  NF1  atypical 
microdeletions described in the literature (Riva P et al., 2000; Kehrer-Sawatzki et al., 2003; Venturin et al., 2004a; 
Pasmant et al., 2008). Details of the microarray design, including the 14,207 oligonucleotide probe chromosome 
locations, has been deposited in NCBI's GEO (Edgar et al., 2002) and are accessible through the GEO accession 
number GSE19730. 

Statistical Analysis 

Multiple logistic regression was performed to test the association of each clinical feature individually with the 
type  of  constitutional  NF1  mutation  (microdeletion  vs.  intragenic  mutation).  Each  regression  model  had  the 
covariates  of  sex  and  age  at  examination  (as  a  continuous  variable)  to  control  for  potential  confounding. Odds 
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated when appropriate. We applied the Bonferroni 
correction, by which the nominal alpha value is adjusted based upon the number of tests performed, to account for 
multiple testing. All statistical analyses were performed with StatView 5.0 software (Cary, NC). 

Array-CGH characterization of the 70 NF1 microdeletions 

RESULTS 

All 70 NF1 microdeletions were accurately characterized with our NF1 customised array-CGH platform and 
consisted  of  77%  type-1  (54/70),  9%  type-2  (6/70),  4%  type-3  (new  recurrent  type)  (3/70),  and  10%  atypical 
microdeletions (7/70) (Table 1). An estimation of the length of each microdeletion as well as their gene content, 
was obtained by using the know locations of the last proximal and first distal non-deleted probes (Table 1; Supp. 
Table S1). A new recurrent ~1.0 Mb microdeletion type, designated here as type-3 microdeletion, was identified in 
three unrelated NF1 patients (GUE, OLI, and N2603), involving NF1-REP-b (but not NF1-REP-a) and NF1-REP-
c.  Figure  1  shows  the  relevant  array-CGH  profiles  for  the  three  recurrent  types.  The  14,207  array-CGH  log2 
normalized ratio data of the 70 patients discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's GEO (Edgar et

Genotype-phenotype Correlation in NF1 Microdeletion Patients  E1511 

From the 70 microdeleted NF1 patients, 12 individuals were excluded from the statistical analysis of genotype-
phenotype correlations: two had the largest atypical  microdeletions (DUB: 7.6 Mb and N806: 5.5 Mb), and 10 
patients had incomplete phenotype data. In the 58 remaining patients (27 men [46%] and 31 women [53%], mean 
age at examination = 20.5 ± 17.6 years), there were 44 type-1, 6 type-2, 3 type-3, and 5 atypical microdeletions. 
The reference group of non-deleted NF1 patients with intragenic truncating mutations (n=389) consisted of 169 
men (43%) and 220 women (57%) with a mean age at examination of 33.2 ± 13.9 years. 

The clinical characteristics associated with the non-deleted, the microdeleted, and the only type-1 microdeleted 

NF1 patients, are provided in Table 2.

The prevalence of the different clinical features in non-deleted patients is comparable to previously reported 
features for the general NF1 population (Huson and Huges, 1994; Friedman and Birch, 1997; North, 2000). When 
compared  to  this  reference  group,  the  microdeleted  patients  as  a  whole  (n  =  58),  had  a  significantly  higher 
incidence of dysmorphic features (52% vs. 11%, P < 0.0001, OR = 5.3 [2.7-10.4]) and learning disabilities (80% 
vs. 52%, P = 0.001, OR = 3.3 [1.6-6.7]) at the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 0.004 (0.05 divided 
by 14 for 14 traits tested individually), after adjusting for age and sex (Table 2). Similar results were obtained 
when only the type-1 microdeleted patients were evaluated (n = 44), with OR = 5.3 [2.5-11.2] and OR = 5.0 [2.0-
12.6]  for  facial  dysmorphism  and  learning  disabilities,  respectively.  Suggestive  evidence  for  association  with

E1512  Pasmant et al. 

childhood  overgrowth  was  observed  when  the  microdeleted  patients  were  considered  as  a  whole,  with  this 
characteristic found to be overrepresented in microdeleted patients compared to non-deleted cases (30% vs. 6%, P 
=  0.005,  OR  =  8.3  [1.9-36.4]).  This  association  was  however  not  statistically  significant  after  applying  the 
conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. No significant associations were observed for any 
other  clinical  features.  The  apparently  higher  incidence  of  cutaneous  neurofibromas  in  non-deleted  patients,  as 
compared to microdeleted patients (78% vs. 51%, respectively), is easily explainable by the greater proportion of 
prepubertal  children  (<  10  years  old)  in  the  latter  group  (36%  vs.  6%).  The  association  of  this  trait  with  the 
presence of an NF1 microdeletion was indeed not significant (P = 0.57) when the effect of age was properly taken 
into account in the multiple regression analysis by using age as a covariate. 

The  proportion  of  de  novo  cases  (which  may  contain  some  cases  of  mosaicism)  was  significantly  higher  in 
microdeleted patients compared to patients with intragenic mutations (79% vs. 43%, Chi Square test, P value < 
0.0001).  Therefore,  somatic  mosaicism  has  to  be  taken  into  account  in  the  evaluation  of  genotype-phenotype 
correlations as it could explain some of the observed differences between the two groups of patients. However, 
when the nature (inherited or sporadic) of the NF1 mutation was introduced in the multiple regression models as a 
covariate, along with sex and age at examination, the associations of facial dysmorphism and learning disabilities 
with NF1 microdeletions (all pooled together) were still significant (P < 0.0001, OR = 4.8 [2.3-10.0] for facial 
dysmorphism, and P = 0.002, OR = 3.4 [1.5-7.3] for learning disabilities). Significant results were also observed 
when  only  the  type-1  microdeleted  patients  were  considered  (P  =  0.0001,  OR  =  4.9  [2.2-11.1]  for  facial 
dysmorphism, and P = 0.001, OR = 5.6 [2.0-15.7] for learning disabilities). Therefore, the association of facial 
dysmorphism and learning disabilities with NF1 microdeletions is unlikely to result from the presence of unknown 
cases of mosaicism in our group of NF1 patients. 

 

DISCUSSION 

The extreme variability of clinical expression in NF1 makes difficult genotype-phenotype correlation, although 
they  are  of  crucial  importance  for  patients  and  their  families.  Hence,  solid  evidence  for  the  existence  of  a 
microdeletion  syndrome  has  awaited  a  comprehensive  phenotype  and  genotype  evaluation  of  a  cohort  of  NF1 
microdeletion subjects ascertained in an unbiased manner and compared with an appropriate reference population 
phenotypically evaluated in the same standardized way as microdeleted patients. 

The 70 newly characterized NF1 microdeletion patients described here, the largest cohort ever reported, with 
the exception of meta-analysis from the published literature (Venturin et al., 2004b), has been both genotyped with 
an  ad  hoc  array-CGH  platform,  and  clinically  phenotyped  utilising  a  standardized  questionnaire.  The 
microdeletion patients were compared to 389 patients with NF1 diagnosed according to the NIH clinical criteria 
and  presenting  intragenic  NF1  truncating  mutations.  NF1  patients  with  NF1  missense  mutations,  with  no  NF1 
mutations, and with SPRED1 mutations were excluded as the NIH criteria cannot reliably distinguish NF1 from 
NF1-like syndrome caused by SPRED1 mutations (NFLS; MIM# 611431) (Pasmant et al. 2009b; Spurlock et al., 
2009;  Messiaen  et  al.,  2009).  This  selection  allowed  comparing  clinical  phenotype  consequences  of  NF1  locus 
microdeletions versus the sole NF1 gene haploinsufficiency (intragenic truncating mutations). 

In  contrast  to  previous  molecular  or  cytogenetic  techniques,  such  as  multiplex  ligation-dependent  probe 
amplification  or  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization,  our  customised  array-CGH  platform  was  able  to 
unambiguously  differentiate  and  characterize  NF1  microdeletion  types  (De  Luca  et  al.,  2007;  Pasmant  et  al., 
2009a).  Notably,  the  high-resolution  of  the  array-CGH  has  allowed  identification  of  a  new  recurrent  NF1 
microdeletion type, designated as type-3, with breakpoints in the paralogous regions middle NF1-REP-b and distal 
NF1-REP–c (Figure 1). The most common type-1 microdeletion involved two paralogous sequences flanking the 
NF1 gene: NF1 proximal and distal LCR (NF1-REP-a and NF1-REP-c). A middle LCR (namely NF1-REP-b) has 
been  previously  identified  between  NF1-REP-a  and  the  NF1  gene  (Jenne  et  al.,  2003;  Forbes  et  al.,  2004;  De 
Raedt et al., 2004, 2006) (Supp. Figure S1). These three LCR blocks (NF1-REP-a, b, and c) belong to a complex 
group of paralogs with three components on 17q11.2 (i.e. in the NF1 microdeletion region: NF1-REP-a, b, and c), 
six at 17q21 (NF1-REP-d, e, f, g, h, and i), one at 17q24 (NF1-REP-j), and another on 19p13 (De Raedt et al., 
2004). Interestingly, a genomic microdeletion caused by NAHR between the NF1-REP-a, and NF1-REP-b repeats 
and which included RNF135 and five other genes, but not the NF1 gene, has been described in an individual with 
an overgrowth syndrome (Douglas et al., 2007). For the first time, we describe a recurrent type-3 microdeletion in 
three unrelated NF1 patients (GUE, OLI, and N2603), with breakpoints located in the paralogous sequences NF1-

REP-b (located between RNF135 and NF1) and NF1-REP-c (Figure 1), consistent with NAHR between these NF1 
medial and distal LCRs. This type-3 microdeletion is ~1 Mb in size and removed the entire NF1 gene and at least 
eight  other  genes:  OMG,  EVI2B,  EVI2A,  RAB11FIP4,  CR17orf79,  UTP6,  SUZ12,  and  LRRC37B,  but  not 
LRRC37B2, CRLF3, ATAD5, CENTA2, and RNF135 (Table 1; Supp. Table S1). It is worth noting that the three 
type-3 NF1 microdeletion patients showed facial dysmorphism. Two of them (GUE and OLI) had subcutaneous 
and  plexiform  neurofibromas.  One  of  them  (GUE)  presented  learning  disabilities  while  this  information  was 
unavailable for N2603 and OLI who were 4 and 3 years old at the examination time, respectively. 

The present study confirms in an unbiased manner the existence of a contiguous gene syndrome associated with 
specific clinical signs in NF1 microdeletion patients. Two NF1 clinical features, learning disabilities and facial 
dysmorphism  show  significant  association  with  NF1  microdeletions,  after  adjusting  for  multiple  comparisons. 
While this finding is consistent with most previous NF1 microdeletion studies, facial dysmorphism appeared to be 
much  less  prevalent  in  the  microdeleted  patients  herein  described  than  previously  reported  (52%  in  this  study 
versus 78% in a meta-analysis of the published literature on the NF1 microdeletions in 78 patients) (Venturin et 
al., 2004b). It is noteworthy that the concomitant presence of both learning disabilities and facial dysmorphism 
was considerably overrepresented in the NF1 microdeleted patients compared to the non-deleted NF1 cases (45% 
vs. 7%, P < 0.0001, OR = 11.0 [5.6-21.4]). Nevertheless, while patients with large deletions of the NF1 locus do 
have  a  much  greater  probability  to  have  learning  disabilities  and  facial  dysmorphism,  it  is  still  impossible  to 
predict  the  presence  of  a  NF1  microdeletion  based  solely  on  these  clinical  symtoms,  as  previously  claimed 
(Tonsgard  et  al.,  1997).  No  association  between  these  two  clinical  features  was  observed  in  our  group  of 
microdeleted patients (P = 0.45, after adjusting for age and sex), suggesting that different genetic factors may be 
involved in the determination of each of these traits. Remarkably, haploinsufficiency of OMG gene, mapping in 
the typical NF1 microdeletion interval, has been proposed to be involved in the learning disabilities found in NF1 
microdeletion patients (Venturin et al., 2006). 

Our  study  also  suggests  some  evidence  of  an  association  of  childhood  overgrowth  with  NF1  microdeletion, 
although this was not significant at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold. This observation confirms results published 
by Spiegel et al. who proposed that overgrowth was indeed a component of the phenotypic spectrum of the NF1 
microdeletion syndrome (Spiegel et al., 2005). RNF135 haploinsufficiency was proposed to be responsible for the 
overgrowth often observed in individuals with NF1 microdeletions (Douglas et al., 2007). Interestingly, none of 
the four microdeleted patients with no RNF135 deletion (i.e. RNF135 not included in the microdeletion interval), 
NF00234, and three type-3 microdeletion patients (GUE, OLI, and N2603), presented childhood overgrowth. It is 
also of note that no RNF135 point mutation or deletion has been found in patients with NF1 intragenic truncating 
mutation  and  with  overgrowth,  ruling  out  a  putative  double  heterozygosity  for  mutations  in  both  the  NF1  and 
RNF135 genes in these patients (data not shown). Our cohort of NF1 microdeleted patients had twice as many 
MPNSTs as did the non-deleted patients (6% vs. 3%), in agreement with previous published results (De Raedt et 
al., 2003). This finding is however not significant, because of the lack of power from small sample size and the 
low incidence of this trait. Hence, these two last findings (childhood overgrowth and possibly increased incidence 
of MPNSTs) warrant be replicated in an independent sample before any conclusions can be drawn. 

This  study  confirms  that  custom  high-resolution  array-CGH  is  a  sensitive  approach,  suitable  for  accurate 
characterization  of  NF1  microdeletions  and  able  to  unambiguously  differentiate  between  the  types  of 
microdeletions.  Further  studies  are  necessary  to  identify  which  gene(s)  among  the  14  genes  deleted  in  NF1 
microdeletion syndrome, are responsible for learning disabilities and facial dysmorphism. Our study demonstrates 
however  that NF1  microdeletion  patients  present  a  more  severe  phenotype  than  that  observed  in  classical  NF1 
patients,  particularly  in  respect  to  the  presence  of  learning  disabilities.  These  data  must  now  to  be  taken  into 
account in NF1 patients’ follow-up care.
