Carboxylic Acid (Bio)Isosteres in Drug Design
Carlo Ballatore,* Donna M. Huryn, and Amos B. Smith, III[a]

The carboxylic acid functional group can be an important con-
stituent of a pharmacophore, however, the presence of this
moiety can also be responsible for significant drawbacks,
in-
cluding metabolic instability, toxicity, as well as limited passive
diffusion across biological membranes. To avoid some of these
shortcomings while retaining the desired attributes of the car-
boxylic acid moiety, medicinal chemists often investigate the
use of carboxylic acid (bio)isosteres. The same type of strategy
can also be effective for a variety other purposes, for example,
to increase the selectivity of a biologically active compound or
to create new intellectual property. Several carboxylic acid iso-
steres have been reported, however, the outcome of any iso-

steric replacement cannot be readily predicted as this strategy
is generally found to be dependent upon the particular con-
text (i.e., the characteristic properties of the drug and the
drug–target). As a result, screening of a panel of isosteres is
typically required. In this context, the discovery and develop-
ment of novel carboxylic acid surrogates that could comple-
ment the existing palette of isosteres remains an important
area of research. The goal of this Minireview is to provide an
overview of the most commonly employed carboxylic acid
(bio)isosteres and to present representative examples demon-
strating the use and utility of each isostere in drug design.

Introduction

The carboxylic acid functional group plays a cardinal role in
the biochemistry of living systems as well as in drug design. A
wide variety of endogenous substances, such as amino acids,
triglycerides and prostanoids, possess the carboxylic acid
moiety. Furthermore, this functional group is often part of the
therapeutic agents.[1]
pharmacophore of diverse classes of
Indeed, a large number (> 450) of carboxylic acid-containing
drugs have been marketed worldwide, including widely used
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, an-
ticoagulants, and cholesterol-lowering statins, among others.
The acidity, combined with the ability to establish relatively
strong electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds,
is the
reason this functional group is often a key determinant in
drug–target interactions. However, despite the success of car-
boxylic acid drugs, the presence of a carboxylic acid residue in
a drug or a drug candidate can represent a liability. For in-
stance, a diminished ability to passively diffuse across biologi-
cal membranes can raise a significant challenge, particularly in
the context of central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery,
where the blood–brain barrier (BBB) can be relatively imperme-
able to negatively charged carboxylates.[2] Furthermore,
idio-
syncratic drug toxicities arising from the metabolism of the
carboxylic acid moiety (e.g., glucuronidation)[3] have been
linked to withdrawals of marketed drugs.[4] Thus, to avoid
these and other possible shortcomings, the replacement of the
carboxylic acid functional group with a suitable surrogate, or
(bio)isostere, can represent an effective strategy.

The concept of bioisosterism is based on the notion that
single atoms, groups or whole molecules that exhibit similar
volume, shape, and/or physicochemical properties can produce
broadly similar biological effects.[5] However, as occasionally
observed, isosteric replacements can result in derivatives that
exhibit different or even opposite pharmacology relative to the
parent carboxylic acids. The outcome of any isosteric replace-
ment cannot be accurately predicted, however, the physico-
chemical properties of both the isostere and the correspond-
ing binding partner(s) in the biological system are often a key
factor. In addition to the acidity of the carboxylic acid surro-
gate, several other parameters, such as size, shape, charge dis-
tribution and lipophilicity, play important roles. The relative im-
portance of each of these properties depends on the particular
context considered. Thus, for instance, whereas lipophilicity of
the isostere might be one of the most important properties
when designing analogues for
improved passive diffusion
across biological membranes, geometry and charge distribu-
tion of the acidic moiety can be critical aspects if the carboxyl-
ic acid isostere is required to establish two-point interactions
with an arginine side chain in the binding site. Several carbox-
ylic acid surrogates have been reported that display utility in
drug design (Figure 1). Herein, we summarize the key proper-
ties and provide representative examples describing the use of
each of the carboxylic acid (bio)isosteres in drug design.

Hydroxamic Acids

Hydroxamic acids exhibit moderately acidic characteristics,
with pKa values in the range of ~ 8–9,[6] and strong metal-che-
lating properties.[7] This functional group is found in a variety
of natural products[8] and in a number of biologically active
compounds.[9] Although hydroxamic acids are most commonly

The main characteristics of both
phosphonic

acids are the relatively high acid-
ity, pKa1 value of ~ 1–3, and their
nonplanar geometries.[17] Com-
pared with carboxylic
acids,
these acidic moieties are more
polar, thus these isosteres usual-
ly lead to a lowering of the parti-
tion coefficient (log P).[17] The use

acid functional group has been
exploited successfully
in the
design of analogues of neuro-
transmitters g-aminobutyric acid
(GABA, 5) and glutamic acid (6)
(Figure 2).[16, 18]
In many cases,
while the affinity of the isosteric
analogue is generally equivalent
to that of the parent carboxylic acid compound, the instrinstic
activity, however, is changed. One such example includes pha-
clofen (7),[19] the phosphonate derivative of the GABA agonist

employed in drug design for their metal-chelating properties,[7]
this functional group has also been employed successfully as
a carboxylic acid bioisostere. Deprotonation of the hydroxamic
acid moiety can lead either
to O anion
(Scheme 1),[10] depending on the nature of the substituents
and solvent.[6, 11] In polar solvents, and at physiological condi-
tions, deprotonation of the hydroxamic acid yields both the N
and O anions. In vivo, hydroxamic acids can undergo relatively
rapid hydrolysis[12] to the corresponding carboxylic acids, al-
though the stability of these compounds towards hydrolysis
can be significantly improved by introducing relatively large
substituents at the nitrogen atom of the hydroxylamine frag-
ment.[13] Such modifications would also prevent the formation

(cf., 15, 16, and 17; Table 3).[22]

baclofen (8). In this case, while baclofen is a GABAB agonist,
phaclofen (7) acts as an antagonist. In the case of mono- or di-
alkylphosphinic acid derivatives of GABA, however, isosteric re-
placement of the carboxylic acid moiety resulted in highly
potent agonists (e.g., 9, and 10; Table 2) that, unlike the natu-
ral ligand (GABA), are selective for GABAB receptors.[16] Similar
outcome was observed for some glutamic acid derivatives,
such as l-AP4 (11; Figure 2), which selectively activate the
group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR).[18]

Sulfonic and Sulfinic Acids

Like phosphonic acids, sulfonic and sulfinic acids are nonplanar
as well as both more polar and acidic (pKa < 1) than carboxylic
acids. Amino acids analogues bearing either sulfonic or sulfinic
acids have been found to be relatively potent activators of the
glutamate receptors.[20] Moreover, sulfonate derivatives of ba-
clofen (8), such as saclofen (12; Figure 2), have been reported

Sulfonamides, Acylsulfonamides, and
Sulfonylureas

Sulfonamides were among the first examples of carboxylic acid
isosteres to show utility in drug design. Classical examples of
this type of carboxylic acid surrogate include the sulfonamide
class of antibacterial agents developed in the 1930s and 40s,
such as sulfadiazine (18) and sulfanilamide (19), the active
form of prontosil (20).[23] Compounds of this class work by in-
hibiting tetrahydropteroate synthetase. The similarities be-
tween the sulfanilamide anion in 19 and the carboxylate of the
natural substrate, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA; 21) were
found to be critical to the bacteriostatic properties of the sulfa-
nilamides.[24] Although nonplanar and generally only weakly

acidic (pKa = ~ 10)[17] compared with PABA (pKa = ~ 6.5), the sul-
fonamide moiety can in fact establish a similar geometry of hy-
drogen bonds compared with carboxylic acids as the distance
between the two oxygen atoms is similar to that found be-
tween the two oxygen atoms of a carboxylate. Furthermore,
incorporation of appropriate substituents can lower the pKa
value of the sulfonamide moiety to a value essentially equal to
that of PABA, for example, sulfadiazine (18) that exhibits a pKa
value of approximately 6.5.

In addition to sulfonamides, acylsulfonamides (also known
as sulfonimides) and sulfonylureas have been used extensively
as carboxylic acid surrogates. The pKa values of acysulfona-
mides and sulfonylureas fall within the range of carboxylic
acids (4–5).[25] Notable examples include several cysteinyl leu-
kotriene (LTE4) receptor antagonists, such as compounds 22
and 23 (Table 4), which exhibit improved activity compared

ing commonly used carboxylic acid bioisosteres, such as tetra-
zole (25).[26] Other interesting examples were reported by sci-
entists at GlaxoSmithKline where replacement of the carboxylic
acid moiety of b3-adrenergic receptor agonist 26 (Table 5) led
to derivatives (27–29) with higher potency and greater func-
tional selectivity for the b3-adrenergic receptor.[27]

ylic acid surrogate is the relatively high lipophilicity, which
makes this moiety potentially attractive for CNS drug discovery
programs, where the presence of a carboxylic acid moiety in
a drug candidate can result in a limited rate of passive diffu-
sion across the BBB.[2] Similar overall properties can be ascribed
to the trifluoromethylketone moiety. Under aqueous physiolog-
ical conditions, this functional group is in equilibrium with the
hydrate form, with the latter being bioisosteric with the
carboxylic acid moiety (Scheme 2).

An interesting case study comparing these two carboxylic
acid surrogates was reported by scientists at Merck in the

tagonists. Whereas carboxylic acid 30 (Table 6) was potent in
the functional assay, this and other related carboxylic acid-con-
taining analogues exhibited limited brain penetration as well
as short half-lives in plasma.[28] Replacement of the carboxylic
acid moiety with either the 2,2,2-trifluoroethan-1-ol or the tri-
fluormethylketone moiety led to derivatives 31 and 32, respec-
tively (Table 6) that retain excellent binding affinity for the EP1
receptor, but exhibit favorable ADME/PK properties including
oral bioavailability and brain penetration.[28]

Tetrazoles

Tetrazoles are amongst the most commonly employed carbox-
ylic acid isosteres; for recent Review articles, see Herr et al.[29]
and Myznikov et al.[30] The 5-substituted tetrazoles exist in
equilibrium between the 1H and the 2H tautomers (Scheme 3).

(pKa = ~ 4.5–4.9).[17, 31] However,

The most important features of the tetrazolic acids are the pla-
narity and acidity, which closely resemble those of carboxylic
acids
relative to carboxylic
acids, tetrazoles are slightly larger.[32, 33] Moreover, analysis of
crystal structures and computational studies indicate that the
hydrogen-bond environment surrounding the tetrazolates ex-
tends further than in the case of carboxylates.[33] In addition,
tetrazolate anions are more lipophilic than the corresponding
carboxylates,[34] and compared with the latter, they exhibit
slightly different electrostatic potential[35] and charge distribu-
tion due to the delocalization of the negative charge over the

dence suggests that tetrazoles, like carboxylic acids, are capa-
ble of forming two-point interactions with amidines.[36] How-
ever, the stability of the tetrazolate–amidine complex is found
to be lower
than the corresponding carboxylate–amidine
salt.[36] Metabolically, tetrazoles can also undergo N-glucuroni-
dation,[3] however, these adducts are not as chemically reactive
as the O-glucuronides derived from carboxylic acids and
hydroxamic acids and, therefore, have not been linked to toxic
effects in humans.

In drug design, the most important examples showcasing
the utility of tetrazoles as carboxylic acid isosteres include sev-
eral nonpeptidic angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antago-
nists.[37] The AT1 receptor is a member of the G protein-cou-
pled receptor (GPCR) superfamily that plays an important role
in vasoconstriction.[38] In a series of N-(biphenylylmethyl)imida-
zole AT1 receptor antagonists, where both carboxylic acid 33
and several bioisosteres (34–37) exhibited potent biological ac-
tivity in vitro, only the tetrazole derivative,
losartan (Cozaar,
38), was found to be effective after oral administration
(Table 7).[39] Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis and model-

The 5-oxo-1,2,4-oxadiazole and related thiadiazole
systems (Figure 1) are planar acidic heterocycles
(pKa = ~ 6–7),[42] which, like tetrazoles, have been suc-
cessfully employed in the synthesis of AT1 receptor
antagonists (Table 8).[43] Interestingly, these heterocy-
cles are reported to be comparatively more lipophilic
than the tetrazole; this property led to increased oral

The thiazolidinedione heterocycle (Figure 1) compris-

erocycle is found in several potent agonists of the
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor g (PPARg)
that are used for the treatment of noninsulin-depen-
dent type 2 diabetes mellitus (e.g., pioglitazone (42);
Figure 3).[45] Since several endogenous compounds,
as well as drug candidates that are known to activate
PPARg, are carboxylic acids,[46] it seems likely that the
thiazolidinedione moiety of the “glitazone” drugs are likely
acting as carboxylic acid surrogate. Thiazolidinediones and re-
lated heterocycles have also been employed as carboxylic acid
bioisosteres in the design of GPR40 agonists (e.g., 43–46;
Figure 3).[47] GPR40 is a GPCR that enhances insulin secretion
when activated by naturally occurring, medium- to long-chain
fatty acids (FFA),[48] or by synthetic carboxylic acid compounds,
such as several aryl propionic acids derivatives.[49]

Indeed, the first marketed thiazolidine-

cause of numerous reports of liver failure that might have

observed with other glitazones.

3-Hydroxyisoxazole and 3-Hydroxyisothiazole

acid (47; Figure 4), which is an agonist of the N-methyl-d-
aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor.[51] This type of carboxylic acid
bioisostere has been employed extensively in the development

(e.g., 50) have been developed.[54]
In addition, among 3-hy-

and antagonists of the ionotropic glutamate AMPA receptor,
such as compounds 51–53 (Figure 4),[51] while examples of 3-
hydroxyisothiazole-containing glutamate derivatives include
NMDA receptor agonist 54 (Figure 4), an isothiazole derivative
of the naturally occurring ibotenic acid.[55]

Substituted Phenols
Although unsubstituted phenols are weakly acidic (pKa = ~ 9.9),
the appropriate choice of electron-withdrawing substituents
can lower the pKa values to within or even below the range of
aliphatic carboxylic acids.[56] Representative examples include
2,6-difluorophenols (pKa = ~ 7.1),[57] which have been employed
as lipophilic bioisosteres of the carboxylic acid in the design of
competitive inhibitors of GABA aminotransferase (e.g., 55 and
56; Figure 5) that exhibit comparable binding affinity for the
enzyme as the natural substrate (GABA).[58] The same bioisos-
tere has been employed to obtain potent noncarboxylate
aldose reductase inhibitors (cf., 57 and 58; Table 9).[59]

Squaric Acid

Squaric acid (59), a planar, diprotic four-membered ring oxo-
carbon, exhibits remarkable acidity (i.e., pKa1 = 0.5, pKa2 =
3.5).[56] Although the acidity of squaric acid, like that of other
cyclic polyones, such as tetronic acid or the cyclopentane-1,3-
diones (see below), can be explained at least in part by the

acids, particularly squaramides (e.g., 60), have been exploited
as bioisosteres of the carboxylic acid and phosphate[63] moiet-
ies. An interesting application of this bioisostere was reported
by Kinney and co-workers, who developed NMDA receptor an-
tagonists, such as 61[64] and 62[65]
in which the
squaramide moiety was used to mimic the a-amino acid
moiety of phosphonate 63 and glutamic acid.[64]

3- and 4-Hydroxyquinolin-2-ones

Notable examples of bioisosterism with the carboxylic acid
moiety have been reported for series of 3- and 4-hydroxyqui-
nolin-2-ones.[66–68] Although considerably less acidic than car-
boxylic acids (pKa = 8.7), scientists at Pfizer discovered that 3-
hydroxyquinolin-2-one-containing d-amino acid oxidase inhibi-
tors can in fact establish hydrogen-bonding interactions within
the enzyme active site, in a very similar fashion as carboxylic
acid-containing inhibitors (cf., 64 and 65; Figure 6).[68] Exam-

have been reported by scientists at Merck with a series of

the carboxylic acid with vinylogous-type acids of noncarboxy-

Tetronic and Tetramic Acids

Tetronic (71) and tetramic (72) acids are naturally occurring
acidic heterocycles.[70] Despite the similar structure, the two
heterocycles exhibit markedly different acidity. Whereas 71 is
considerably acidic with a pKa value of ~ 3.8, the corresponding
pyrrolidine-2,4-dione (i.e., tetramic acid) exhibits a pKa value of
~ 6.4.[71] This difference has been explained by the fact that te-
tronic acid exists predominantly in the enol tautomeric form
(71 B; Scheme 6) and, as such, behaves more as an oxoacid,
whereas the tautomeric equilibrium of tetramic acid is believed
(72 A;
to be shifted more towards the di-oxo tautomer
Scheme 6),
leading this heterocycle to exhibit pKa values of
a carbon acid.[56]

Although tetronic and tetramic acids are found in numerous
biologically active compounds, their use as carboxylic acid iso-
steres is not particularly common. Examples include a series of
tetramic acid-containing NMDA antagonists (e.g., 73; Table 12)

tane-1,3-dione derivatives.[74]

that were designed based on the same pharmacophore model
used in the design of 3’-substituted-4-hydroxy-2-quinolones
described above (Table 11). Other studies also reported tetronic
and tetramic acid-containing derivatives of known NSAIDs as
g-secretase modulators with in vitro activities comparable to
the parent carboxylic acid compound.[72]

Cyclopentane-1,3-diones

Related to tetronic and tetramic acids, cyclopentane-1,3-diones
(e.g., 74; Scheme 7) exist as rapidly exchanging enol–ketone
tautomers.[73] As such, consistent with the principle of vinylo-
gy,[61] 1,3-diones exhibit pKa values that fall within the range of
carboxylic acids.[73] The characterization of the cyclopentane-

1,3-diones as potential bioisosteres of
the carboxylic acid
moiety was recently demonstrated for the first time in our lab-
oratory.[74] Evaluation of physicochemical properties revealed
that, in addition to the intrinsic acidity, the cyclopentane-1,3-
dione unit, like carboxylic acids, can form relatively stable 1:1
salt complexes with amidines.[74] Furthermore, a series of deriv-
atives of the known thromboxane A2 (TP) receptor antagonist,
75,[75]
in which the carboxylic acid moiety is replaced by
a mono or di-substituted cyclopentabe-1,3-dione unit, resulted
in TP receptor antagonists with IC50 values in the nanomolar
range against human and mouse TP receptors (e.g., com-
pounds 76, 78, and 79; Table 13).[74] A unique aspect of the cy-
clopentane-1,3-dione unit is that it presents multiple points of
attachment, which can be exploited to impart alternative ori-
entations of the bioisostere (cf., 76 and 77; Table 13) and/or to
diversify the structure of the acidic moiety.

Other Potential Bioisosteres

In addition to the isosteres discussed above, several other
cyclic and acyclic structures, including boronic acids, mercap-
toazoles, and sulfonimidamides, might be useful bioisosteres
of the carboxylic acid moiety. The boronic acid moiety, for ex-
ample, which is found in a number of biologically active com-
pounds,[76] is likely to establish hydrogen bonds of similar geo-
metries as carboxylic acids despite the limited acidity of this
functional group (pKa = ~ 9–10). Likewise, mercaptoazoles (e.g.,
80–91; Table 14),[77] which, depending on the oxidation state of
the sulfur atom, can exhibit relatively wide ranges of acidity,

might also be useful in drug design. Finally, cyclic sufonimida-
mides (e.g., 92; Scheme 8) have recently been proposed by sci-
entists at AstraZeneca as potential bioisosteres of the carboxyl-
ic acid moiety.[78] The sufonimidamide heterocycle exhibits pKa
values of 5–6, and although they can exist in four possible

structure data suggest that the most stable tautomer has the
acidic proton on the nitrogen in position 2 (92 A). The most
distinctive feature of this heterocycle is the presence of a ste-
reogenic tetrahedral sulfur atom, as well as an sp3 carbon that
can permit structural differentiation of the acidic moiety. Al-
though there have been no reports of this particular heterocy-
cle being applied successfully to the synthesis of biologically
active compounds, the structural and physicochemical proper-
ties of this class of heterocycles make them potentially promis-
ing carboxylic acid bioisosteres.

Outlook

As highlighted in this Minireview, a diverse set of carboxylic
acid bioisosteres have been identified, which exhibit various
degrees of similarities with the carboxylic acid moiety in terms
of size, geometry, charge distribution, acidity, and lipophilicity.
However, as the outcome of any isosteric replacement is typi-
cally dependent upon the particular context defined by the
physicochemical properties of the isostere and the correspond-
ing binding counterpart(s) in the biological target(s), the availa-
bility of an increasingly larger set of potential carboxylic acid
surrogates is ultimately critical to the success of the isosteric
replacement strategy. Thus, the investigation of new and alter-
native structures that could complement the existing palette
of carboxylic acid surrogates remains an important area of
research.
