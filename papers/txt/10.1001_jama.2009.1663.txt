Context Autosomal dominant inactivating sprouty-related EVH1 domain–
containing protein 1 (SPRED1) mutations have recently been described in individuals
presenting mainly with cafe´ au lait macules (CALMs), axillary freckling, and macro-
cephaly. The extent of the clinical spectrum of this new disorder needs further delin-
eation.
Objective To determine the frequency, mutational spectrum, and phenotype of neu-
rofibromatosis type 1–like syndrome (NFLS) in a large cohort of patients.
Design, Setting, and Participants In a cross-sectional study, 22 unrelated pro-
bands carrying a SPRED1 loss-of-function (LOF) mutation identified through clinical
testing participated with their families in a genotype-phenotype study (2007-2008).
In a second cross-sectional study, 1318 unrelated anonymous samples collected in 2003-
2007 from patients with a broad range of signs typically found in neurofibromatosis
type 1 (NF1) but no detectable NF1 germline mutation underwent SPRED1 mutation
analysis.
Main Outcome Measures Comparison of aggregated clinical features in patients
with or without a SPRED1 or NF1 mutation. Functional assays were used to evaluate
the pathogenicity of missense mutations.
Results Among 40 SPRED1 LOF-positive individuals from the clinical cohort, 20 (50%;
95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-66%) fulfilled National Institutes of Health (NIH)
NF1 diagnostic criteria based on the presence of more than 5 CALMs with or without
freckling or an NF1-compatible family history. None of the 40 SPRED1 LOF-positive
individuals (0%; 95% CI, 0%-7%) had discrete cutaneous or plexiform neurofibro-
mas, typical NF1 osseous lesions, or symptomatic optic pathway gliomas. In the anony-
mous cohort of 1318 individuals, 34 different SPRED1 mutations in 43 probands were
identified: 26 pathogenic mutations in 33 probands and 8 probable nonpathogenic
missense or silent mutations in 10 probands. Of 94 probands with familial CALMs with
or without freckling and no other NF1 features, 69 (73%; 95% CI, 63%-80%) had
an NF1 mutation and 18 (19%; 95% CI, 12%-29%) had a pathogenic SPRED1 mu-
tation. In the anonymous cohort, 1.9% (95% CI, 1.2%-2.9%) of individuals with the
clinical diagnosis of NF1 according to the NIH criteria had NFLS.
Conclusions A high SPRED1 mutation detection rate was found in NF1 mutation–
negative families with an autosomal dominant phenotype of CALMs with or without
freckling and no other NF1 features. Among individuals in this study, NFLS was not
associated with the peripheral and central nervous system tumors seen in NF1.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 1

(NF1) (Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man [OMIM]
162200), an autosomal
dominant disorder affecting approxi-
mately 1 in 3000 individuals world-
wide,1,2 results from inactivating mu-
tations in the NF1 tumor suppressor
encoding neurofibromin. Neurofibro-
matosis type 1 is characterized by mul-
tiple cafe´ au lait macules (CALMs),
skin-fold freckling, iris Lisch nodules,
and tumors of the nervous system such

as optic pathway gliomas, astrocyto-
mas, neurofibromas, and malignant pe-
ripheral nerve sheath tumors. Other fre-
quently observed features are specific
bone abnormalities, short stature, mac-
rocephaly, and learning problems.

Health (NIH) NF consensus confer-
ence in 1988,3 were updated in 1997,4
and are widely used to make the diag-
nosis using information obtained from
physical examination, family history,
and radiologic studies.

Neurofibromin is a negative regula-
tor of RAS and pathogenic NF1
(NM_000267.2) mutations result in
increased active RAS (guanosine
triphosphate–bound RAS) and
increased signaling through the down-
stream effectors such as the mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) path-
way.5 Recently, a genetically distinct
but phenotypically similar disorder
caused by heterozygous SPRED1
(NM_152594.2) mutations was identi-
fied (OMIM 611431).6-8 Sprouty-
related EVH1 domain–containing pro-
tein 1 (SPRED1), a member of the
SPROUTY/SPRED family, negatively
regulates MAPK signaling by inhibi-
tion of RAS-RAF interaction.9-11 Inacti-

vating SPRED1 mutations, resulting in
increased MAPK signaling, were found
in individuals from 5 families with
multiple CALMs, freckling, and mac-
rocephaly, with many fulfilling the
NIH criteria for NF1 based on the
presence of CALMs, freckling, or pres-
ence of a positive family history.6

In the original study,6 families suit-
ably sized for linkage analysis had spe-
cifically been collected based on indi-
viduals with multiple CALMs with or
without freckling and absence of a de-
tectable NF1 mutation, which may im-
ply that the observed phenotype and
possible complications associated with
the disorder might have been biased or
underestimated. Similarly, the study by
Spurlock et al8 and Pasmant et al7 pri-
marily focused on SPRED1 analysis in
patients with the mild pigmentary phe-
notype. Given the absence of neurofi-
bromas in any patient described so far,6-8
it has been proposed to refer to this new

syndrome as Legius syndrome (as
named in OMIM 611431)7,8 and dis-
continue referring to it as neurofibro-
matosis type 1–like syndrome (NFLS).
In this study, we determined the phe-
notype in 22 unrelated probands and
18 relatives carrying a SPRED1 loss-of-
function (LOF) mutation identified
through clinical genetic testing. In ad-
dition, we carried out a cross-
sectional study in an anonymous co-
hort of 1318 unrelated patients referred
for NF1 genetic testing, in whom no
NF1 mutation was found, allowing de-
lineation of the SPRED1 mutational
spectrum and estimation of the fre-
quency of NFLS.

METHODS
The flow of participants included in the
studies is shown in FIGURE 1.

Clinical Cohort
In a cross-sectional study, a SPRED1
LOF mutation was identified in 26 NF1-
negative probands (with clinical NF1
testing before July 2007) for whom a
blood sample was received (August
2007–September 2008) for clinical
SPRED1 mutation testing (this test be-
came available by August 2007 and is
described at http://www.genetics.uab
.edu/medgenomics). Probands were re-
ferred from 19 different centers in the
United States and Canada. Written in-
formed consent to collect phenotypic
and genotypic data was obtained from
study participants and parents or guard-
ians of children. Clinical notes and phe-
notypic information as available
through the referring physician were
reviewed.

Height and head circumference at a
given age were converted to percen-
tiles using the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention US growth charts
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad
/ad314.pdf). An individual was re-
corded as macrocephalic when head cir-
cumference was above the 97th
percentile. An individual was re-
corded to have relative macrocephaly
when head circumference was above the
97th percentile at the age when height
would have been at the 50th percen-

tile. Information on race/ethnicity was
recorded by the referring health care cli-
nician as African American, Asian, His-
panic, Native American, Caucasian,
other (eg, Pacific Islander) or “not pro-
vided.” Additional detail on ethnic
background was requested if essential
for interpretation of the genetic re-
sults. The study was approved by the
University of Alabama at Birmingham
(UAB) Institutional Review Board.

Anonymous Cohort
of NF1-Positive
and NF1-Negative Samples
Samples received at the UAB Medical
Genomics Laboratory for NF1 genetic
testing (August 2003–July 2007) were
included in an anonymous study if a
phenotypic checklist (http://www
.genetics.uab.edu/medgenomics) sum-
marizing the NF1-related clinical signs
at the time of blood sampling had been
completed by the referring physician.
This is a cross-sectional, referral-
based study with samples received from
more than 250 different referral cen-
ters in the United States (85%), Canada
(8%), Latin America (2%), Australia and
New Zealand (2%), Asia (1.5%), and
Europe (1.5%). This inevitably im-
plies heterogeneity in the quality of the

data set, which is based on these phe-
notypic data forms. In total, 2432 un-
related samples with phenotypic data
were available by July 2007, which
equals approximately 85% of samples
received.

Search for genotype-phenotype cor-
relations using a Microsoft Access (Mi-
crosoft, Redmond, Washington) data-
base containing phenotypic and
mutation data was approved by the UAB
Institutional Review Board. The fol-
lowing data were entered through the
password-protected Access database:
year of birth, age of the individual at
time of completion of the phenotypic
checklist, country of origin, sex, race/
ethnicity, sporadic or familial, stan-
dardized information pertaining to the
NF1-related signs, and a unique iden-
tifier not linked to date of birth, name,
or other database connected to such in-
formation. The same unique identifier
was labeled on an aliquot of the left-
over sample from the patients referred
for NF1 clinical testing. Entries were ex-
ported to an Microsoft Excel table for-
mat to facilitate the subsequent statis-
tical analyses.

In 1114 of 2432 individuals, an NF1
mutation had been identified. Anony-
mous DNA samples from 1318 NF1-

negative probands underwent further
research-based SPRED1 mutation analy-
sis, resulting in 3 groups of pheno-
typic data: NF1 mutation–positive,
SPRED1 LOF mutation–positive, and
NF1 and SPRED1 LOF mutation–
negative cohorts. This NF1-negative co-
hort is not biased toward the initially
reported phenotype in patients with a
SPRED1 mutation.6 Genetic research on
the anonymous samples was ap-
proved by the UAB Institutional Re-
view Board. The 26 probands in the
clinical cohort are most likely also part
of the anonymous cohort because these
patients previously had an NF1-
negative test result during the study pe-
riod.

Mutation Analysis, Functional
Analysis of Missense Mutations,
and Homology Modeling
Comprehensive NF1 and SPRED1 mu-
tational testing was performed as de-
scribed in the eAppendix and eTable 1.
The pathogenicity of identified mis-
sense mutations was analyzed using 2
different functional assays: (1) neu-
rite outgrowth of pheochromocytoma
12 (PC12) cells in vitro after stimula-
tion with nerve growth factor and (2)
Elk-1 activation and phosphorylation.

Both functional assays are described in

was carried out as described in the eAp-

Statistical Analysis
Ninety-five percent confidence inter-
vals (CIs) of proportions were calcu-
lated with the exact binomial method
using Statcalc version 1.1 (http://www
.ucs.louisiana.edu/~kxk4695/StatCalc
.htm). We also calculated sensitivity,
specificity, and positive and negative pre-
dictive values for detection of a SPRED1
mutation in the NF1-negative cohort,
also using Statcalc.

RESULTS
Clinical Cohort
In the clinical cohort, a SPRED1 mu-
tation was identified in 27 NF1-
negative probands (eTable 2); 22 had
a SPRED1 LOF mutation (including 2
LOF missense mutations: p.Thr102Arg
and p.Pro415Ala); 4 of 6 missense mu-
tations and 1 silent mutation were clas-
sified as rare, probably benign vari-
ants: p.Cys74Arg, p.Ser149Asn,
p.Asp398Asn, p.Cys433Tyr, and
c.42T⬎C (eTable 3). Forty-three rela-
tives of the 22 probands with a SPRED1
LOF mutation participated in the study
and 18 of 43 carried the family-
specific SPRED1 mutation. Six of 22
were de novo cases (27%; 95% CI, 11%-
50%). Phenotypic details of 40 indi-
viduals with a SPRED1 LOF mutation
are provided in TABLE 1 (aggregated
data) and eTable 2 (individual data); 14
of 40 had more than 5 CALMs and ax-
illary/inguinal freckling. An addi-
tional 6 individuals fulfill NF1 criteria
if family history is taken into account.
The majority of individuals (35/40) had
more than 5 CALMs even at a young
age. Axillary/inguinal freckling was mild
or faint in 7 of 14 patients with freck-
ling (FIGURE 2A).

Noonan syndrome (OMIM 163950;
an autosomal dominant disorder char-
acterized by a variable combination of
facial dysmorphism, short stature, pec-
tus deformity, and congenital heart
defects12) was suspected in 1 child (in-
dividual S10-III1; individual/family
numbering is shown in eTable 2), a mild
pulmonic valve stenosis was present in
individual S11-I2, and mild to severe pec-
tus excavatum was seen in 3 individu-
als (Figure 2B and eTable 2). Five chil-
dren had abnormal language and speech
development and 5 were reported to have
attention deficit, hyperactivity, or both.
None of the individuals carrying a
SPRED1 mutation showed neurofibro-
mas, typical osseous lesions, or a symp-
tomatic optic pathway glioma.

We observed 1 occurrence each of te-
nosynovial giant cell tumor, angioli-
poma, breast cancer, and dermoid tu-
mor of the ovary and 2 lipomas in 1
individual (eTable 2). No tumor ma-

terial was available to study the causal
involvement of SPRED1.

In family S23, the NF1 mutation
c.2755delG had previously been iden-
tified in a classically affected patient,
S23-III1 (eTable 2), but no NF1 muta-
tion was found in several of his rela-
tives with NF1 signs (individuals S23-
II2, S23-II3, S23-I2, and S23-III3). A
truncating SPRED1 mutation was found
in individual S23-II3 (the younger
brother of individual S23-II2), in indi-
vidual S23-I2 (the mother of indi-
vidual S23-II2 and S23-II3), and in in-
dividual S23-III3 (the child of individual
S23-II3) but was absent in individuals
S23-II2 and S23-III1.

Anonymous Cohort
Spectrum of SPRED1 Mutations. We
identified34differentSPRED1mutations
in 43 probands in the anonymous cohort
of 1318 unrelated NF1-negative patients
(eFigure 1). The majority of mutations
(23/34) are predicted to result in a pre-
mature stop codon. Furthermore, 1 in-
frame deletion (c.242_256del15bp;
p.Ile81_Val85del), 9 different missense
mutations, and 1 silent mutation were
found. Mutations were spread over the
entire gene; 23 are novel. Eight differ-
ent mutations (p.Arg16X; p.Arg18X,
p.Arg24X, p.Arg64X, p.Arg117X,
p.Thr313Met, p.Arg325X, and
p.Asp398Asn), accounting for 12 of the
43 mutations, can be attributed to deami-
nation at methylated CpG dinucleo-
tides. No SPRED1 copy number changes
were detected.

SPRED1 Missense Mutation. The
phenotype of individuals carrying a
(probably) benign missense mutation
is described in eTable 3.

silico homology modeling, are summa-
rized in the eAppendix, eTable 4, and
eFigure 2, eFigure 3, and eFigure 4.

Phenotypic Characteristics. We
identified 33 LOF SPRED1 mutations
(eFigure 1) in an anonymous NF1-
negative cohort of 1318 unrelated pro-
bands presenting with a broad range of
NF1-related signs, not biased toward the
phenotype initially described in pa-
tients with a SPRED1 mutation.6 Demo-
graphic and phenotypic features of a co-
hort with and without SPRED1
mutations were compared with a co-
hort of 1114 patients with a definitive
NF1 mutation (TABLE 2 and TABLE 3).
Mean age was 14.9 years in the NF1-
positive cohort, 9.5 years in the
SPRED1-positive cohort, and 12.4 years
in the NF1/SPRED1-negative cohort.
The average number of NIH criteria ful-
filled was 2.39 in the NF1-positive co-
hort, 1.84 in the SPRED1-positive co-
hort, and 0.89 in the NF1/SPRED1-
negative cohort.

The high proportion of sporadic pa-
tients likely reflects the greater uptake
of genetic testing among patients with
diagnostic uncertainties in the ab-
sence of a family history. Thirty-one of
33 SPRED1 LOF–positive individuals
had more than 5 CALMs with or with-
out freckling and no other NF1 crite-
ria, 13 (39%; 95% CI, 23%-58%) of
which were sporadic cases.

The ratio of SPRED1/NF1 muta-
tions detected in the total group of 2432
patients was 33/1114 (3.0%; 95% CI,
2.0%-4.1%): 20/251 (8.0%; 95% CI,
4.9%-12.0%) in the familial group vs 13/
863 (1.5%; 95% CI, 0.8%-2.6%) in the
sporadic group.

Of 1086 patients fulfilling NIH cri-
teria for clinical diagnosis of NF1, an
NF1 mutation was found in 823 (76%;
95% CI, 73%-78%), a SPRED1 muta-
tion in 21 (1.9%; 95% CI, 1.2%-2.9%),
and no NF1/SPRED1 mutation in 243
(22%; 95% CI, 20%-25%), with 211 of
243 being sporadic cases.

No SPRED1 mutations were found in
any NF1-negative patients with neuro-
fibromas, optic pathway glioma, Lisch
nodules, or typical osseous lesions. The

sensitivity, specificity, and positive and
negative predictive values to detect a
SPRED1 mutation in the analyzed NF1-
negative cohort are reported in eTable 5.
The highest positive predictive value
was observed in familial patients with
more than 5 CALMs with or without
freckling and no other criteria (0.720;
95% CI, 0.506-0.879), with a sensitiv-
ity of 0.545 (95% CI, 0.364-0.719) and
a specificity of 0.995 (95% CI, 0.988-
0.998).

COMMENT
We investigated the clinical spectrum
of a neurofibromatosis type 1–like syn-
drome, recently named Legius syn-
drome (OMIM 611431), and esti-
mated its frequency relative to NF1 in
an anonymous cohort of patients with
a broad range of signs typically found

in NF1. Individuals with SPRED1 mu-
tations presented with multiple CALMs
with or without freckling. The derma-
tologic phenotype in young children
with a SPRED1 mutation could not be
differentiated from NF1 and half of in-
dividuals (20/40) with a SPRED1 mu-
tation fulfilled the NF1 diagnostic cri-
teria based on presence of more than 5
CALMs with or without skinfold freck-
ling and with or without familial his-
tory.

Most patients presented with a mild
phenotype compared with NF1, al-
though in family S24, severe progres-
sive dystonia, a large temporal venous
anomaly, and a vascular anomaly were
present. In the report by Spurlock et al,8
1 patient had an inguinal heman-
gioma, which is of interest given the re-
cently identified association of RASA1

mors or learning problems. In our
study, 5 children had abnormal lan-
guage and speech development and 5
were reported to have attention deficit/
hyperactivity. The importance of
SPRED1 for hippocampal-dependent
learning was recently documented in
mice.16 Future studies need to system-
atically investigate potential problems
with speech, learning, and behavior in
children with SPRED1 mutations.

None of the individuals in our study
had neurofibromas, typical osseous le-
sions, or symptomatic optic pathway
gliomas. In this and previous studies,
no systematic occurrence of any tu-
mor type was observed, except possi-
bly subcutaneous lipomas in adults, also
frequently observed in the general
population. Tenosynovial giant cell tu-
mor, dermoid tumor of the ovary,
Wilms tumor, tubular colon ad-
enoma, acute leukemia, and non–
small cell lung cancer were each ob-
served in only 1 individual once.

Combining data on 53 adults with
NFLS from this study and in previous
reports6-8 results in a post hoc power es-
timate of 80% to detect complications
occurring in at least 5% of affected
adults. Using the binomial distribu-
tion, the chance of detecting 2 cases
with a specific complication with a
prevalence of 5% in a group of 53 in-
dividuals is 76%. Combining data from
this and previous reports6-8 on indi-
viduals aged 5 years or older with a
SPRED1 mutation (n = 79), we esti-
mated, in post hoc power calculation,
that this sample size would allow de-
tecting complications with a preva-
lence of at least 3% with a power esti-
mate of 80%. None of these 79
individuals had evidence of plexiform
neurofibroma, discrete neurofibroma,
or symptomatic optic pathway glioma,
suggesting that the frequency of these
complications is lower than in NF1
(plexiform neurofibromas, 24%; dis-
crete neurofibromas, 53%; sympto-
matic optic pathway gliomas, 4.3%17).
However, even these pooled data are
underpowered to detect rare compli-
cations associated with a prevalence of

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 1–LIKE SYNDROME

only 1%; a study of 250 well-charac-
terized, preferably adult patients would
be needed. Other limitations of the pre-
sent study are the referral bias (mainly
diagnostic uncertainty) and heteroge-
neity of clinical data (many clinical NF
experts involved).

As of July 2007, no NF1 mutation
had been identified through clinical
testing in 1318 of 2432 unrelated pa-
tients who fulfilled inclusion criteria for
further anonymous studies at the UAB
Medical Genomics Laboratory. Many
samples were submitted because of a di-
agnostic uncertainty: 55% fulfilled fewer
than 2 NIH criteria and 87% were spo-
radic. SPRED1 analysis of this anony-
mous NF1-negative cohort revealed a
SPRED1 LOF mutation in 33 of 1318.
No SPRED1 copy number changes were
found in this or previous studies6-8 but
we recently identified 3 different mul-
tiexon deletions, indicating the need for
dosage analysis in the clinical setting
(L.M., unpublished data).

Clinical features of the cohort with
a SPRED1 LOF mutation (n=33) were
compared with the cohort without mu-
tations in NF1 and SPRED1 (n=1285)
and with the cohort with an NF1 mu-
tation (n=1114). Twenty-one of 1087
individuals (approximately 2%) fulfill-
ing NIH diagnostic criteria in the en-
tire anonymous cohort carried a
SPRED1 mutation. All individuals car-
rying a pathogenic SPRED1 mutation
were found in the subgroup of pa-
tients with multiple CALMs with or
without freckling but fulfilling no other
NIH criterion. No SPRED1 mutations
were found if patients had neurofibro-
mas, optic pathway glioma, ophthal-
mologically proven Lisch nodules, or
a typical NF1-associated osseous le-
sion. The data from this anonymous co-
hort further underscore that associa-
tion of these features with NFLS must
be rare.

In this study of 957 sporadic pa-
tients with CALMs with or without
freckling and no other criterion, 414
(43%) had a NF1 mutation in the blood
and 13 (1.3%) had a SPRED1 muta-
tion. An NF1 mutation was found in
150 of 159 familial patients (94%) with

more than 5 CALMs with or without
freckling and an additional criterion,
usually the presence of neurofibro-
mas, but in 69 of 94 familial patients
(73%) with CALMs with or without
freckling only. In this last group, 18 of
94 families (19%) showed a SPRED1
mutation, and in 7 of 94 (7%), no mu-
tation could be identified in NF1 or
SPRED1.

The NIH NF1 criteria, originally de-
signed to help identify families suit-
able for linkage studies that led to the
positional cloning of the NF1 gene, are
widely used and allow establishment of
a clinical diagnosis of NF1 in most
cases. In individuals with CALMs with
or without freckling and no other spe-
cific distinguishing features, present-
ing sporadically or with a family his-
tory of CALMs with or without
freckling only, the NIH criteria can-
not reliably distinguish NF1 from
NFLS. In such patients, a correct diag-
nosis has important implications for
prognosis, counseling, and potential
prenatal genetic diagnosis. Although an
NF1 diagnosis may become apparent
with the passage of time, the diagnosis
will remain uncertain for individuals
who do not develop other signs of NF1.
Molecular genetic testing can re-
solve the diagnosis in most such cases.
In case of diagnostic uncertainty, we
recommend that NF1 should be ana-
lyzed first and, if negative, SPRED1 test-
ing should be considered in patients
with CALMs with or without freck-
ling and no other NF1 diagnostic fea-
tures. Identification of a SPRED1 mu-
tation may relieve a psychological
burden from families who otherwise
would be in a waiting mode for poten-
tial serious NF1-associated manifesta-
tions.

We currently are conservative re-
garding the clinical surveillance of
SPRED1-positive patients and recom-
mend the same medical follow-up as
that for patients with NF1. Less strin-
gent surveillance may possibly be rec-
ommended for these patients if clini-
cal data from several hundreds of
patients confirm the low frequency of
benign and malignant tumors.

practitioners, clinical geneticists, pe-
