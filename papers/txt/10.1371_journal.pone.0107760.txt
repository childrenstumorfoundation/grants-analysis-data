Abstract

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign nerve sheath tumors mostly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. They
often extend through multiple layers of tissue and therefore cannot be treated satisfactorily by surgery. Nilotinib is a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat leukemia, with advantages over the prototype imatinib in terms of potency and
selectivity towards BCR-ABL, and the DDR, PDGFR, and KIT receptor kinases. In this study, we compared efficacies of the two
drugs on cultured cells of PNF in vitro and on xenografted tumor fragments on sciatic nerve of athymic nude mice.
Xenografts were monitored weekly using a high resolution ultrasound measurement. Treatment with nilotinib at a daily
dose of 100 mg/kg for four weeks led to a reduction of the graft sizesstd by 6867% in the 8 treated mice, significantly more
than the 3368% reduction in the 8 untreated mice (P,0.05) and the 47615% in the 7 mice treated with imatinib (P,0.05).
The peak plasma nilotinib concentration 6.661.1 mM is within the pharmacological range of clinical application. Imatinib, but
not nilotinib significantly hindered body weight increase of the mice and elevated cytotoxicity of mouse spleen cells (P,
0.05). Our results suggest that nilotinib may be more potent than imatinib for treating PNFs and may also be better
tolerated. Imatinib seems to have some off-target effect in elevating immunity.

Introduction

type 1 (NF1), a tumor

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign tumors originating
from peripheral nerve sheath and mostly associated with
neurofibromatosis
suppressor gene
syndrome [1]. Depending on their location, size and growth type,
PNFs can cause pain and disfigurement, functional impairment of
vision, mobility, bladder and bowel [2]. PNFs have a high risk of
malignant transformation into malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumors (MPNST) which is the leading cause of NF1-related death
[3–5]. The lifetime risk of MPNST for NF1-patients has been
estimated to be about 8 to 13% and thus is more than 1000 times
higher for these patients than for the general population. The
lifetime risk to develop an MPNST increases to 30–50% in
patients with NF1 and PNF [6–8]. Since PNFs often extend
through multiple layers of tissue, total resection is usually not
possible without damaging functions and organs [9–10].

Nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis Pharmaceuticals) is an orally active
tyrosine kinase inhibitor which targets ABL (and the oncogenic
BCR-ABL),
tyrosine kinases
including those for stem cell factor (c-KIT), collagen (DDR-1/-2)

together with several

receptor

(PDGFR-a/-b)

and platelet-derived growth factor
[11–13].
Nilotinib has a number of advantages over imatinib (Glivec;
Novartis Pharmaceuticals),
including a different toxicity profile
and a lower incidence of fluid retention. A recent clinical trial of
newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia indicated that
nilotinib was superior to imatinib in terms of potency and
selectivity of BCR-ABL inhibition; reduction of progression events;
absence of a response plateau [14,15].

Our more recent

study revealed an inhibitory effect of
nilotinib on proliferation, viability and vitality of PNF-derived
Schwann cells and nerve sheath tumor cells in vitro with 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC50) values
than that of
imatinib in our previous study [16,17]. However, the experi-
mental settings were different in the two in vitro studies and an
in vivo study was not performed. In the present study, we
comparatively studied efficacies of the two drugs on PNF in
vitro on cultured tumor cells and in vivo on xenografted tumor
fragments in mice.

Specimen and in vitro study

The donor of the study specimen was a 12-year-old female NF1
patient, diagnosed according to the modified National Institutes of
Health criteria [18]. A parent of the patient gave informed written
consent in addition to assent from the patient. The Institutional
Review Board approved the study (OB-061/05). Her PNF was
operated at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, University
Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf. A part of the tumor was kept in
Hanks buffered saline and delivered into the laboratory for cell
culture and for xenografting. Schwann cells from the PNF were
cultured and identified as previously described [16].

After ensuring purity of 85%, PNF-derived Schwann cells were
treated with nilotinib and imatinib (Novartis Pharma AG,
Switzerland), each at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mM for 10 days. Cell
proliferation and viability assays were performed as previously
described [16].

RNA expression comparison of PNF-segments

To assess variability between PNF grafts, we performed RNA-
sequencing from 4 pieces of the original tumor sample and from
one unrelated PNF. RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tumors
using Trizol. and mRNA was reverse transcribed using Super-
Script III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen,
Carlsabd, CA). Sequencing libraries were prepared using TruSeq
Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation kit
(Illumina, San
Diego, CA) Libraries were sequenced on a Genome Analyzer IIx

Xenografting and treatment

The care and use of laboratory animals were carried out in strict
accordance with the local animal care and use committee’s
research council’s guide (Approval No.: Hamburg 112/11).
Athymic nude mice (female, nu/nu Balb/c, 6 weeks, 20 g) were
obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany).

The xenografting of

fragments of PNF was carried out as
described previously [17,19]. Briefly, a small incision was made
into the skin to expose the right sciatic nerve and an incision was
made into the sciatic nerve, under which one tumor piece was
orthtopically implanted (Fig. 1A, B). After confirming successful
xenografting by ultrasound scanning one week later, the 23 mice
were randomly allocated into three groups: 8 as controls, 8 for
nilotinib treatment and 7 for imatinib treatment.

Nilotinib (as the hydrochloride salt) was diluted in 10% N-
methyl-pyrrolidinone and 90% polyethylene glycol 300. Imatinib
(as
the mesylate salt) was dissolved in sterile water. Oral
administration at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg of the drugs was
started on day 7 after implantation and was continued to day 35.
Body weights of the mice were recorded daily and the drug dosage
was adjusted accordingly. Food consumption and general condi-
tion of the mice were monitored weekly.

At the end of the treatment, animal blood was collected 3 hours
the last oral administration of nilotinib for plasma
after
preparation. Nilotinib concentration was measured using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry [20].

images of the xenografts were generated and analyzed using the
Vevo software version 5.0.0 to calculate their size in volume
(Fig. 1B–D).

Cytotoxicity of mouse spleen cells

Non-adherent spleen cells were harvested from the mice after
erythrocyte- depriving and 3 hours adherence at 37uC. Cytotoxic
efficacy of the non-adherent spleen cells was assessed by adding
them as effector cells to PNF-derived Schwann cells as target cells
at a ratio of 1:10 for 4 h using the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive
Cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Fitchburg, WI).

Statistical analysis

The effect of the drugs in vitro was evaluated using Student’s t-
test and the IC50 was calculated. Sizes of each xenograft and
body weight of the mice were normalized against the corre-
sponding initial values. Time course of
the
xenografts and body weight increase of the mice in the three
groups were compared with each other using a linear mixed
model. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the
relationships between the reduction of tumor volumes and the
cell cytotoxicity, and between the reduction of tumor volumes
and the nilotinib concentrations. P,0.05 was

Results

Nilotinib inhibits PNF cells more potently than imatinib
Both nilotinib and imatinib dose-dependently inhibited prolif-
eration and viability of the PNF-derived Schwann cells (Fig. 2).
However, the IC50 values of nilotinib were 4.0 and 4.7 mM, much
lower than the 12.4 and 14.6 mM of imatinib.

Nilotinib suppressed PNF-xenografts more potently than
imatinib

All animals tolerated xenografting and treatments well without
visible signs of toxicity and gross abnormalities. General conditions
of mice were also compatible among the untreated and the two
treated groups. The body weights of mice increased 10% (23.961.0
to 26.461.6g) in the control group and 7% (23.461.8 to 25.161.8g)
in the nilotinib group but not in the imatinib group (2% = 23.361.2
to 23.761.7g) over the 28-days of treatment period (Fig. 3). Only
the difference between the imatinib group and the control group
was significant (P,0.05).

The initial sizes of the xenografts were comparable among the
control, nilotinib and imatinib groups, which were 6.063.7 mm3,
5.962.5 mm3 and 5.263.4 mm3, respectively. Grafts decreased in
size in all mice for the first two weeks and stabilized and slightly
decreased in untreated mice (Fig. 4A). In contrast, size of the
xenografts decreased in mice treated with nilotinib (Fig. 4B) or
imatinib (Fig. 4C) continued. The decrease in xenograft size was
significantly more profound in the nilotinib group than in the
untreated group (6867% vs. 3368%, P,0.05) and than in the
imatinib group (47615%, P,0.05, Fig. 4D).

Peak plasma nilotinib concentration was 6.661.1 mM. No
correlation was observed between the extent of reduction of
tumor volumes and the plasma nilotinib concentrations (r = 0.24,
P.0.05). RNA sequencing of 4 different pieces from the original
PNF that was used for grafting showed similar but not identical
expression patterns, indicating biological variability of the different
pieces (data not shown).

Cytotoxicity of mouse spleen cells

Imatinib and nilotinib elevated cytotoxicity of mouse spleen
cells on cultured PNF Schwann cells significantly, 21.167.2% and
17.666.2%, respectively vs. 12.567.1% in spleen cells of untreated
mice whereas imatinib was significantly more potent than nilotinib
(P,0.05, Fig. 5). There was no correlation between the reduction

Discussion

We showed that nilotinib inhibited proliferation of PNF-derived
Schwann cells in vitro substantially more potently than imatinib.
The applied IC50 values of 4.0 mM and 12.4 mM were compatible
to the plasma concentrations of the two drugs in patients [12,21],
legitimating their potential clinical application for PNF.

No growth was observed in any of

in
concordance with the result of the natural history study of PNF,
which showed no growth in the majority of cases and very slow
growth over years in the few cases where the tumors do grow. It is
therefore unreasonable to expect any detectable growth of small
xenografts in short experiment periods of less than 2 months. In
fact, xenografts tend to shrink in the 2 to 3 weeks after the
implantation,
likely due to clearance of pre-grafting and post-
grafting cell death. Drug effect can therefore be described as an
increase in graft size reduction, which is more profound after 2 to
3 weeks. Indeed, we could detect significantly more grafts size
reduction in the drug-treated mice than in the untreated control
mice. Furthermore, the significantly more potent effect of nilotinib
over imatinib could also be demonstrated in this in vivo model.

This is of high relevance for patients with PNF, which suffer
mostly from the secondary tumor size effects.

Recently, a growth deceleration of PNF was reported in
children treated with imatinib [22]. In concordance, we also
observed a deceleration of body weight increase in mice treated
with imatinib. Judging from body weight, nilotinib was better
tolerated than imatinib by the mice, indicating a better side effect
profile of the former.

Since off-target effects of imatinib have been reported, among
them the effect of activating natural killer cells [23], we measured
cytotoxicity of spleen cells of the treated mice. We found elevated
cytotoxicity of spleen cells in imatinib -treated mice and to a lesser

extent,
imatinib might have an immune-activating component
in its
anti-PNF effect, such that its pharmacological mechanism differs
from that of nilotinib.

in nilotinib-treated mice. This

finding suggests

In summary, our data reveal a more potent antitumor effect of
nilotinib on PNF than imatinib in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the
potential clinical application of nilotinib for PNFs.
