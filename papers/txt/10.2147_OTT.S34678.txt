Abstract: Since its first description in Drosophila by Drs Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus 
in  1980,  hedgehog  (Hh)  signaling  has  been  implicated  in  regulation  of  cell  differentiation, 
proliferation, tissue polarity, stem cell maintenance, and carcinogenesis. The first link of Hh 
signaling to cancer was established through studies of Gorlin syndrome in 1996 by two inde-
pendent teams. Later, it was shown that Hh signaling may be involved in many types of cancer, 
including skin, leukemia, lung, brain, and gastrointestinal cancers. In early 2012, the US Food 
and Drug Administration approved the clinical use of Hh inhibitor Erivedge/vismodegib for 
treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinomas. With further investigation, 
it is possible to see more clinical applications of Hh signaling inhibitors. In this review, we 
will summarize major advances in the last 3 years in our understanding of Hh signaling acti-
vation in human cancer, and recent developments in preclinical and clinical studies using Hh 
signaling inhibitors.

Introduction
Remarkable  progress  has  been  made  since  the  hedgehog  (Hh)  mutant  phenotype 
was first described in fruit fly in 1980.1 Three vertebrate homologues of Hh and their 
receptors were identified in the 1990s.2–6 As an essential pathway during development, 
the Hh pathway is critical for maintaining tissue polarity and stem cell population. 
The  first  link  between  Hh  signaling  and  cancer  was  shown  in  tumor-prone  Gorlin 
syndrome in 1996.7–11 In early 2012, Hh signaling inhibitor GDC-0449 (Erivedge/
vismodegib; Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) was approved by the US 
Food and Drug Administration for treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal 
cell carcinomas (BCCs).

The general signaling mechanisms of the Hh pathway are conserved from flies to 
humans.12 Mammalian Hh signaling molecules include ligands (sonic Hh, Indian Hh, 
and desert Hh), patched receptors (PTCH1, PTCH2), signal transducer smoothened 
(SMO),  and  transcription  factors  (Gli1,  Gli2,  Gli3)  (see  Figure  1).  In  the  absence 
of ligands, SMO serves as the key signal transducer, whose function is inhibited by 
another  transmembrane  protein  patched  (PTCH1).  Upon  binding  of  an  active  Hh 
ligand, this inhibition is released, allowing SMO to signal downstream, eventually 
leading to activation of Gli transcription factors. Gli molecules can bind the specific 
consensus sequences located in the promoter region of the target genes to regulate 
target gene expression.13,14

Figure 1 A diagram of hedgehog (Hh) signaling in mammalian cells. Smoothened (SMO) is the key signal transducer of the Hh pathway. in the absence of the Hh ligands, Hh 
receptor patched (PTC) is thought to be localized in the cilium to inhibit SMO signaling. Coreceptors of Hh include CDO (cell adhesion molecule-related/downregulated by 
oncogenes), brother of CDO (BOC), Gas1, glypican 3, (GPC3), and GPC5. wnt inhibitory factor-1 (wiF1) can also regulate Hh signaling through association with CDO, BOC, 
or GPC5. Gli molecules are processed with the help of suppressor of fused (SuFu)/KiF7, β-TRCP molecules into repressor forms, which turn off the Hh signaling pathway. 
Other negative regulators of Gli molecules include Rab23, protein kinase A (PKA), SuFu, tumor suppressor sucrose nonfermenting 5 (SNF5), Culin 3 (Cul3), and itchy e3 
ubiquitin ligase (Itch) through regulation Gli protein modifications, nuclear–cytoplasm shuttling, as well as transcriptional activities. In the presence of Hh, PTC is thought to be 
shuttled out of cilium and is unable to inhibit SMO. The ciliary localization of SMO is thought to require β-arrestin 2 (βArr2), and G protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). 
Hh reception promotes SMO conformational changes to form dimers. Gli molecules are now processed to active forms (GliA), which will activate the Hh target genes. This 
process can be inhibited by KiF7 and SuFu. Protein kinase C isoform ι/λ (PKCι/λ) is known to positively regulate Gli transcriptional activity. Positive regulators are in red, 
negative regulators are in blue, and target genes are in pink. KiF7 can function (in black) as a negative regulator or a positive regulator. The interacting pathways with the Hh 
pathway are in green. Although the role of cilium for Hh signaling during embryonic development is well established, cancer cells generally lack cilia. it has been demonstrated 
that lack of cilia prevents development of basal cell carcinomas in mice. it is not clear whether this is true for all other types of Hh signaling-associated cancer.

In the last 3 years, there has been significant progress 
regarding Hh signaling and its significance in cancer devel-
opment and therapeutics. The total number of publications 
on Hh signaling in the last 3 years is close to 30% of all 
Hh-related  publications,  and  progress  has  been  made  in 
the  following  areas:  1)  better  understanding  of  Hh  signal 
transduction and the associated target genes, 2) more reliable 
mouse models linking Hh signaling to human malignancies, 
3) better understanding of Hh signaling mechanisms during 
cancer development and metastasis, 4) an increasing num-
ber of clinical and preclinical studies on cancer treatment 
using Hh signaling inhibitors, and 5) emerging evidence of 
Hh signaling in supporting residual cancer cells and cancer 
stem cells.

Signal transduction  
of the Hh pathway
All  Hh  proteins  are  secreted  molecules,  functioning  at 
short range on nearby cells or at long range to distant cells 
during  development.15–17  Hh  protein  precursors  undergo 
post-translational  modifications  (autocleavage  to  release 
the  N-terminal  fragment  [HhN],  covalently  binding  to  a 
cholesterol moiety at the C-terminal end, and palmitoylation 
by a palmitoylacyltransferase at the N-terminus of HhN).18–21 
Molecules involved in Hh protein transport and distribution 
include the transmembrane transporter-like protein dispatched 
(Disp),22–24 metalloproteinases,25 the heparan sulfate proteo-
glycans Dally-like (Dlp) and Dally26,27 or their regulators,28 as 
well as enzymes such as sulfateless and tout velu.29–31

Hedgehog signaling in human cancer

Figure  1  shows  the  mammalian  Hh  signaling  pathway 
with  major  players  in  the  diagram.  Several  molecules  are 
engaged in reception of Hh ligands, with patched (PTC, one 
PTC in fly, and two PTCs in vertebrates: PTCH1 and PTCH2) 
as the major receptor.32 Studies from cultured cells indicate 
that PTC inhibits SMO at a substochiometric concentration.33 
Hh-interacting protein (HIP) can compete with PTC on Hh 
binding, resulting in negative regulation of Hh signaling.34 On 
the other hand, interference Hh or its vertebrate homologues 
cell adhesion molecule related/downregulated by oncogenes 
(CDO) and BOC (brother of CDO), GAS1, and glypican-3 
(GPC3) serve as coreceptors of Hh.35–42 In contrast to the 
inhibitory effect of glypican-3, glypican-5 (GPC5) and other 
heparan  sulfate  proteoglycans  are  shown  to  stimulate  Hh 
signaling by promoting binding of sonic Hh to PTCH1.43,44 
The effect of GPC5 and interference Hh homologues requires 
another  secreted  extracellular  molecule:  Wnt  inhibitory 
factor-1 (WIF1).45,46 It is still not entirely clear how binding 
of Hh proteins results in the pathway activation. It is proposed 
that PTC limits SMO signaling via transporting endogenous 
small molecules specifically targeted to SMO. Candidates 
of  these  small  molecules  include  PI4P,  lipoproteins,  and 
provitamin D3.47–50 It is currently not very clear how these 
molecules regulate SMO signaling.

It  is  now  known  that  glucocorticoid  molecules  can 
modulate  SMO  signaling  through  regulating  its  ciliary 
 localization.51  Several  recent  reports  support  SMO  to 
G protein coupling,52–55 but the physiological relevance of 
the G protein coupling of SMO in carcinogenesis has not 
been convincingly demonstrated. Gα can also regulate Gli 
proteins  independent  of  SMO.56  It  is  quite  clear  that  two 
important events occur during SMO signaling in mammalian 
cells. First, SMO protein undergoes conformational change to 
favor SMO signaling,57 although the regulatory mechanism 
underlying this conformational change is not clear. Second, 
ciliary translocation of mammalian SMO protein is critical 
for Hh signaling.58–63 Several reports now link neuropilin 1/2 
(Nrp1/2) to SMO signaling.64–67

Several molecules are identified to be genetically down-
stream of SMO in Drosophila, including COS2, suppressor 
of fused (SuFu), and fused. A COS2 homologue, kinesin 
like-protein  KIF7,  functions  in  the  Hh  pathway  but  not 
directly  associated  with  SMO,68–72  suggesting  that  KIF7 
does  not  contain  all  COS2  functions  in  vertebrates.  In 
contrast, the phenotype of fused-/- mice is very different 
from Shh null mice,73–75 indicating that fused is not criti-
cal for Hh signaling during early embryonic development 
in mice.

In  addition  to  the  Drosophila  homologues,  mamma-
lian cells have several novel cytoplasmic regulators of Hh 
signaling, including Rab2376 and tectonic.77 Rab23 and tec-
tonic are all negative regulators downstream of SMO. We 
have shown that Rab23 is involved in Gli–SuFu interaction78 
(see  Figure  1).  Unlike  many  Rab  proteins,  we  found  that 
Rab23 is localized both in the nucleus and in cytoplasm,79 
suggesting that Rab23 may have other unrevealed functions 
apart from membrane trafficking.

The  ultimate  effect  of  Hh  signaling  is  activation  of 
downstream  Gli  transcription  factors,  which  regulate 
target  genes  by  directly  binding  a  consensus  binding  site 
(5′-tgggtggtc-3′) in the promoter.13,14,80,81 The activity of Gli 
transcription factors can be regulated at several levels. First, 
nuclear–cytoplasmic  shuttling  of  Gli  molecules  is  tightly 
regulated.82–85  Protein  kinase A  can  retain  Gli1  protein  in 
the  cytoplasm  via  a  protein  kinase A  site  in  the  nuclear 
localization signal domain,83 whereas activated Ras signaling 
induces  Gli  nuclear  localization.85  Second,  ubiquitination, 
acetylation, and protein degradation of Gli molecules are reg-
ulated by several distinct mechanisms, including β-TRCP-, 
cul3/BTB-,  and  numb/itch-mediated  Gli  ubiquitination, 
sumoylation, and acetylation.86–93 In addition, Gli3 (Gli2 to a 
lesser extent) can be processed into transcriptional repressors, 
which may be mediated by the β-TRCP E3 ligase.88,94 SuFu 
not only prevents nuclear translocation of Gli molecules but 
also inhibits Gli1-mediated transcriptional activity.95–97 Other 
mechanisms to modify Gli functions include interaction with 
a negative regulator sucrose nonfermenting 5 (SNF5)98 and a 
positive regulator protein kinase C isoform ι/λ.99

Several feedback regulatory loops exist in this pathway to 
maintain a certain level of Hh signaling in a given cell. PTC, 
HIP, GAS1, neuropilins, and Gli1 are components, as well 
as the target genes of this pathway. PTC and HIP provide 
negative  feedback  regulation,  whereas  Gli1  and  Nrp1/2 
form positive regulatory loops. On the other hand, GAS1 is 
downregulated by the Hh pathway but is a positive regulator 
for Hh signaling.100 Alterations of these loops would lead to 
abnormal signaling of this pathway, such as inactivation of 
PTCH1 in BCCs.

Activation of the Hh pathway  
in human cancer
The initial link between Hh signaling and human cancers was 
made from the discovery that mutations of human PTCH1 
are associated with a rare and hereditary form of BCC, basal 
cell nevus syndrome (BCNS) (also Gorlin syndrome).101–103 
Gorlin syndrome is a rare autosomal genetic disease with two

distinct sets of phenotypes: an increased risk of developing 
cancers  such  as  BCCs,  medulloblastomas,  rhabdomyosar-
comas, and meningiomas, as well as developmental defects 
such as bifid ribs and ectopic calcification.104

Almost all BCCs and about 30% of medulloblastomas 
have activated Hh signaling via gene mutations in PTCH1, 
SMO,  or  other  Hh  pathway  molecules.105–109  In  addi-
tion,  cancers  associated  with  Gorlin  syndrome,  including 
rhabdomyosarcoma110,111 and meningiomas,112–114 are reported 
to  have  gene  mutations  in  the  Hh  signaling  pathway  or 
elevated Hh target gene expression. Activated Hh signaling 
has been detected in a variety of human cancer types, either 
in the tumor or in the stroma.100,115–117

Genetically engineered mice with Ptch1 and Smo genes 
have generated more convincing evidence for the critical role 
of Hh signaling in cancer. In addition to BCCs and medullo-
blastomas,  rhabdomyosarcomas  develop  in  mice  with 
expression of oncogenic SmoM2 or knockout of Ptch1.118–121 
One surprising finding from tissue-specific Ptch1 knockout 
is the development of gastrointestinal stromal-like tumors 
(GIST),122 suggestive of a role of Hh signaling in GIST. Even 
in the situation of a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) mouse 
model, expression of oncogenic SmoM2 increases the tumor 
number, whereas Smo knockout reduces the tumor number.123 
Recent  study  of  Barrett’s  esophagus  indicates  that  sonic 
Hh expression in the epithelium of the esophagus can lead 
to stromal expression of Hh signaling target genes, which 
is  similar  to  the  human  situation.124,125  In  contrast,  tissue-
specific  expression  of  oncogenic  Smo  molecule  SmoM2 
has  no  effects  on  K-Ras-induced  pancreatic  cancer126  or 
on  prostate  cancer.127 The  negative  data,  however,  do  not 
rule  out  the  promoting  effects  of  Hh  signaling  for  tumor 
metastasis,  a  major  factor  for  cancer  mortality.  Currently, 
there are only a limited number of mouse models for cancer 
metastasis. Even for the available mouse models for cancer 
metastasis, several variable factors make cancer metastasis 
models less robust, and these factors include mouse genetic 
backgrounds, low incidence, and long duration to observe 
metastasis in mice.

Hh signaling in tumor initiation, 
promotion, and metastases
Hh  signaling  plays  different  roles  in  different  types  of 
cancer.100 Based on the published data, we attempt to divide 
the  functions  of  Hh  signaling  during  cancer  development 
into three types: the tumor driver, the tumor promoter, or the 
regulator for residual cancer cells after therapy. For example, 
activated  Hh  signaling  can  drive  development  of  BCCs, 

medulloblastomas, rhabdomyosarcoma, GIST, and Barrett’s 
esophagus,118,119,122,124,128,129 and Hh signaling in these lesions 
serves as the tumor driver, at least in the mouse models. For 
SCLC, Hh signaling can promote cancer development but 
is not sufficient to drive tumor formation, and thus serves as 
a tumor promoter.123 In pancreatic cancer, inhibition of Hh 
signaling does not affect tumor formation but can promote 
tumor metastasis.130–137 For other cancer types, Hh signaling 
may regulate the number of cancer stem cells or the tumor 
microenvironment, such as leukemia and liver cancer.138,139 
As more in vivo data are available, we predict more revelation 
of the tumor promoting role of Hh signaling. Tumor recur-
rence after therapy is a major issue in clinical care of cancer 
patients, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy resistance, 
and will be discussed in “Hh signaling, cancer stem cell, and 
residual cancer cells.” For some cancer types, Hh signaling 
may not have any roles to play.

Activation  of  Hh  signaling  does  not  work  in  isolation 
but rather crosstalks with other signaling pathways during 
cancer  development  and  metastasis.  Earlier  studies  indi-
cated that Ptch1+/- mice with P53 knock out all developed 
medulloblastomas,  whereas  ,30%  of  Ptch1+/-  mice  (with 
wild-type  P53)  had  this  type  of  tumor.140 We  have  shown 
that skin-specific knockout of Stat3 or its upstream activa-
tor Il11ra significantly reduced Hh signaling-mediated BCC 
formation.141 Increasing data have indicated close collabo-
ration  between  Hh  signaling  and  growth  factor  signaling 
pathways.  Our  earlier  work  indicated  that  platelet-derived 
growth factor α (PDGFRα) is regulated by Hh signaling and 
is responsible for cell proliferation in BCCs.142 Now more 
links are reported between Hh and other pathways, including 
epidermal growth factor, insulin growth factor, transforming 
growth factor β (TGFβ), mTOR/S6K1, RACK1, notch, and 
protein kinase C.100,143–151 Although some of these molecules 
are involved in regulation of tumor microenvironment, such 
as TGFβ,  others  are  known  to  regulate  cancer  stem  cells, 
such as PDGFRα and notch. We will have more discussion 
on cancer stem cells in “Hh signaling, cancer stem cell, and 
residual cancer cells.”

Increasing evidence indicates that Hh signaling plays an 
important role during tumor metastasis in several types of 
cancer, such as pancreatic and breast cancers.135,152 Studies 
from  many  groups  indicate  activation  of  Hh  signaling  in 
the  stromal  as  well  as  tumor  compartments  in  metastatic 
pancreatic cancer.130,133–137,153 In fact, Hh signaling inhibitors 
are effective in suppressing tumor metastases of pancreatic 
cancer.135 Hh signaling also regulates bone homeostasis as 
well  as  bone  metastasis  in  breast  cancer  independent  of

the  Hh  ligands.143  During  tumor  metastasis,  Hh  signaling 
activation is observed both in the tumor compartment and 
in the stroma.135 The molecules mediating Hh’s metastatic 
functions remain largely untested, but there are reports to 
indicate the following molecules: snail, TGFβ, Wnt, HGF, 
and  muc5 AC.135,154–157  Further  studies  will  be  needed  to 
understand the molecular basis by which Hh signaling medi-
ates cancer metastases.

Hh signaling inhibitors: preclinical 
and clinical studies
More  than  200  compounds  have  been  disclosed  to  have 
inhibitory effects on Hh signaling. Of these, eight have been 
used for clinical trials (see Table 1 for the list). There are 
three major targeting sites for Hh signaling inhibitors identi-
fied so far: Hh molecules (Shh neutralizing antibodies, small 
molecule Robotnikinin), SMO protein (cyclopamine and its 
derivatives  IPI-926  and  CycT,  and  synthetic  compounds 
GDC-0449, XL-139/BMS833923, LDE-225, PF04449913, 
and  LY2940680),  and  Gli  inhibitors  (HPI-1,  HPI-2, 
GANT-56, and GANT-61).100 The major advances include 
successful clinical trials using GDC-0449 and US Food and 
Drug Administration approval of GDC-0449 for treatment 
of locally advanced and metastatic BCCs. However, com-
bination of Hh signaling inhibitors with gemcitabine or Hh 
signaling inhibitors alone did not show any improvements in 
the outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients. We summarize 
these data below.

Table 1 shows the list of Hh signaling inhibitors in clinical 
trials, with all eight small molecules targeting SMO. Clinical 
trials  with  GDC-0449  in  BCCs  are  the  most  successful. 
The successful Phase II clinical trials were preceded with a 
remarkable Phase I clinical trial in patients with metastatic 
BCCs.158 This drug is well tolerated by patients.159–161 Two 
independent groups used GDC-0449 to treat BCNS patients 
and  sporadic  BCCs,  respectively,  via  oral  administration. 

Although the overall outcomes were very encouraging, the 
responses  of  two  groups  of  patients  were  quite  different. 
Although  BCNS  patients  had  virtually  a  100%  response 
rate, sporadic BCCs had only a 33% response rate. Previous 
studies in mouse models indicate that tumors acquire somatic 
mutations  in  Smo  or  other  signaling  pathways  following 
GDC-0449  administration,162  which  may  explain  why  not 
all sporadic BCCs responded well. A more rational way to 
treat sporadic BCCs is topical application. Two groups (one 
from Novartis AG and one from Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd/
Genentech) indeed tested that possibility with BCNS patients 
and  obtained  impressive  responses.163,164  Mechanisms  to 
Smo  antagonist  resistance  include  mutations  in  the  target 
SMO gene or alterations in the PI3K pathway.165,166 Several 
ways have been explored to mitigate drug resistance to SMO 
antagonists, such as itraconazole and arsenic trioxide, poly-
meric nanoparticle-encapsulated Hh signaling inhibitors, or 
vitamin D3.167–170 Hopefully, some of these combined treat-
ments will provide benefits to BCC patients.

Studies  in  animal  models  demonstrated  significant 
inhibition  of  Hh  signaling  inhibitors  on  medulloblastoma 
development. For example, oral administration of IPI-926 
or PF-5274857 can reduce tumor development, leading to 
a  longer  lifespan  in  mouse  medulloblastoma  models.171,172 
However, an early clinical trial on a medulloblastoma patient 
using GDC-0449 yielded only a transient therapeutic effect, 
due to an SMO mutation occurring soon after treatment.173 
The outcome data of current medulloblastoma clinical trials 
are not available, but there is still a high expectation.

There  is  evidence  to  support  that  rhabdomyosarcoma 
is  very  responsive  to  Hh  signaling  inhibitors.  First,  gene 
expression  analyses  revealed  elevated  Hh  target  gene 
expression  in  embryonic  rhabdomyosarcomas.111  Second, 
preliminary  studies  used  forskolin  or  SMO  inhibitor  to 
shrink tumors in mouse models.174 In addition, evidence for 
Hh signaling in meningiomas and SCLC is quite clear, and

Hh signaling inhibitors should be effective in these tumor 
types as well.

Hh signaling, cancer stem cell,  
and residual cancer cells
Increasing  evidence  indicates  that  Hh  signaling  is  critical 
for cancer stem cell maintenance and function.138,175,176 For 
example, leukemia stem cell maintenance and expansion are 
dependent on Hh signaling.138,175 The effect of Hh signaling 
on a normal hematopoietic stem cell population, however, is 
still quite controversial, with some showing effects but others 
with no effects.138,177–180 Based on cancer stem cell theory, it 
is anticipated that Hh signaling activation exerts resistance 
to cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy.181 Several studies 
have indeed shown that Hh signaling activation is associ-
ated  with  chemotherapy  or  radiotherapy  resistance.182–183 
Hh  signaling  inhibitor  IPI-926  enhances  delivery  of  the 
chemotherapeutical drug gemcitabine in a mouse model of 
pancreatic cancer. Relevance to the cancer stem cell theory is 
the link between Hh signaling activation and cancer relapse 
from drug resistance.

Based on the published data, we propose that Hh signaling 
may help maintain the stemness of cancer stem cells, which 
are generally insensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 
There  is  evidence  to  indicate  that  Hh  signaling  regulates 
expression of cancer stem cell-related markers, such as alde-
hyde dehydrogenase, Bmi1, snail, Wnt2, PDGFRα, jagged-1, 
CD44, and c-MET.135,155,184–188 The level of Hh expression is 
often  higher  in  the  cancer  stem  cell  population  in  several 
cancer  types.189–193 Thus,  we  have  reasons  to  believe  that 
inhibition of Hh signaling may be effective in reducing the 
number of cancer stem cells, which may play an important 
role in chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy play an important role 
in the clinical care of cancer patients, but resistance to these 
treatments remains a major obstacle in cancer patient care. 
Recent studies revealed a few examples for the role of Hh 
signaling  in  chemotherapy  and  radiotherapy  resistance. 
Resistance  to  docetaxel  is  a  major  clinical  challenge  for 
prostate cancer patients. A recent study revealed an impor-
tant role of Hh signaling on docetaxel resistance in prostate 
cancer.194 Combination of notch and Hh signaling inhibitors 
was  able  to  reverse  docetaxel  resistance  both  in  cultured 
cells and in xenografts. Activation of Hh signaling via PI3 K 
is also reported in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer,195 and 
a  combination  of  Hh  signaling  inhibitor  GDC-0449  with 
tamoxifen significantly reduced cell colony formation and 
tumor development in xenografts. In addition, activated Hh 

signaling  is  shown  to  be  responsible  for  drug  resistance 
in  ovarian  cancer,  cervical  cancer,  and  myeloid  leukemic 
cells.196–198 A recent study also suggests that Hh signaling 
may be associated with antiepidermal growth factor receptor 
therapy (targeted therapy) resistance observed in head and 
neck cancer.144 The exact mechanisms by which Hh signal-
ing activation confers drug resistance are not entirely clear, 
but it is reported that Hh signaling can regulate expression 
of several drug resistance-related genes such as ABCG2 and 
MDR.198,199 The cancer stem cell theory can also explain some 
of the mechanisms.

Overcoming recurrence to radiotherapy is also very chal-
lenging, but recent studies suggest that inhibiting Hh signal-
ing may help mitigate radiotherapy resistance in pancreatic 
and head/neck cancer. For pancreatic cancer, we found that 
a combination of Hh signaling inhibitor BMS833932 (see 
Table 1 for details) and radiation could significantly reduce 
the  number  of  lymph  node  metastasis.135  Similarly,  high 
expression of Gli1 is reported to be associated with lymph 
node metastases and tumor progression after radiotherapy in 
squamous cell carcinomas of the head/neck.200

Summary and future perspectives
In summary, the link of Hh signaling activation to a variety 
of human cancer implies the relevance of studying Hh signal-
ing to human health. Rapid advancement in the discovery of 
novel Hh signaling inhibitors has provided many opportu-
nities for developing novel cancer therapeutic strategies. It 
is not surprising to learn that several major challenges still 
exist to prevent the use of Hh signaling inhibitors in clinics. 
These challenges include a lack of basic understanding of 
the molecular mechanisms by which Hh signaling mediates 
carcinogenesis; no clear criteria to identify the right tumors 
for therapeutic application; only a few reliable, physiologi-
cally  relevant,  and  reproducible  mouse  models  for  cancer 
metastases  to  test  and  optimize  drug  dosages  in  order  to 
minimize side effects; and a lack of clear strategies to miti-
gate drug resistance. Over the last 3 years, research in this 
area has greatly improved, as indicated in this review. It is 
anticipated that additional novel therapeutic strategies will 
be developed for cancer clinical trials using Hh signaling 
inhibitors in the next few years.
