Abstract

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder
that occurs in 1 of 4000 births and is characterized by benign and malignant tumors.
Cardiovascular defects also contribute to NF1, though the pathogenesis is still unclear. Deficiency
in neurofibromin (encoded by Nf1) in mice results in mid-embryonic lethality owing to cardiac
abnormalities previously thought to be secondary to cardiac neural-crest defects. Using tissue-
specific gene inactivation, we show that endothelial-specific inactivation of Nf1 recapitulates key
aspects of the complete null phenotype, including multiple cardiovascular abnormalities involving
the endocardial cushions and myocardium. This phenotype is associated with an elevated level of
ras signaling in Nf1−/− endothelial cells and greater nuclear localization of the transcription factor
Nfatc1. Inactivation of Nf1 in the neural crest does not cause cardiac defects but results in tumors
of neural-crest origin resembling those seen in humans with NF1. These results establish a new
and essential role for Nf1 in endothelial cells and confirm the requirement for neurofibromin in the
neural crest.

Neurofibromin has ras GTPase-activating activity and can downregulate ras signaling. The
absence of this activity is thought to underlie some or all aspects of NF1 in humans. NF1 is
characterized by proliferation and malignant transformation of neural-crest derivatives.
Affected individuals also have disorders that seem unrelated to the neural crest, including
hypertension, renal artery stenosis, higher incidence of congenital heart disease, especially
valvular pulmonic stenosis, and vascular abnormalities in the central nervous system known
as moya-moya1,2. NF1 functions as a tumor-suppressor gene, and loss of heterozygosity in
somatic tissues has been associated with tumor formation3.

Attempts to produce animal models of NF1 have been hampered by the fact that inactivation
of Nf1 in mice leads to mid-gestation lethality from cardiovascular abnormalities. These
defects include structural malformations of the outflow tract of the heart and enlarged
endocardial cushions3–5, which are the anlage of cardiac valves. Normally, neural-crest
cells migrate to the outflow region of the heart and contribute to the endocardial cushions as
early as embryonic day (E) 10.5 (Fig. 1a,b). Neural-crest defects can result in abnormal
morphogenesis of the heart6, and cardiac abnormalities in Nf1−/− embryos have been
attributed to the loss of neurofibromin function in cardiac neural-crest cells3,4. But the
majority of cells in the forming endocardial cushions are derived from underlying
endothelial cells that undergo epithelial–mesenchymal transformation (Fig. 1c–e). Hearts of
Nf1−/− embryos have abnormal epithelial–mesenchymal transformation5. This could result
from defective signaling by the neural crest or myocardium or from abnormal differentiation
of the endothelium.

We used a conditional gene inactivation approach to ablate neurofibromin function
specifically in the endothelium. A conditional allele of Nf1 (Nf1tm1Par, herein called Nf1flox)
is susceptible to Cre-mediated recombination in vivo (Fig. 1f) and is a phenocopy of the null
allele7. We crossed Nf1flox mice with Tek–cre transgenic mice (also called Tie2-Cre) in
which expression of Cre recombinase is driven by an endothelial-specific promoter/
enhancer8. Endothelial-specific inactivation of Nf1 (Nf1ec) recapitulates the cardiovascular
phenotype observed in Nf1−/− embryos. We examined cardiac anatomy of wild-type, Nf1−/−
and Nf1ec embryos from eight litters (Fig. 2 and Table 1). In comparison with wild-type
embryos (Fig. 2a,e), Nf1−/− (Fig. 2b,f) and Nf1ec (Fig. 2c,g) embryos had enlarged
endocardial cushions. Hearts of Nf1ec embryos also had ventricular septal defects (Fig. 2g),
double outlet right ventricle (data not shown), thinned myocardium (Fig. 2k) and pericardial
effusions (Fig. 2c and data not shown), which were similar to those seen in Nf1−/− embryos.

The myocardial defects that we observed were secondary to endothelial dysfunction and
were not reproduced by tissue-specific inactivation of Nf1 in myocardial cells (data not
shown). Signaling between the endocardium and myocardium is required for proper
myocardial development9. Likewise, an endothelial-derived neurofibromin-dependent
paracrine signal may be required by neural-crest cells for proper development of neural-
crest-derived structures. Nevertheless, our data indicate a genetic requirement for
neurofibromin in endothelial cells. These observations may explain why individuals with
NF1 have a higher incidence of valvular pulmonic stenosis, hypertension and other
cardiovascular disorders2.

Neurofibromin deficiency in endocardial cells results in altered ras signaling.
Immunohistochemistry identified phosphorylated MAPK (P-MAPK) in the hearts of wild-
type and neurofibromin-deficient embryos at E11.5. Occasional endothelial cells positive for
P-MAPK were present in the region of the endocardial cushions of hearts of wild-type
embryos (Fig. 3a,c). Expression was more robust and was present in more endothelial cells
lining the endocardial cushions in hearts of Nf1−/− embryos (Fig. 3b,d). Activation of
MAPK suggests that Nf1 deficiency results in elevated ras signaling in endocardial cells,
though other regulators of MAPK phosphorylation and other ras-GAPs exist. Using a ras
activation assay, we determined that endothelial cell–specific loss of neurofibromin leads to
ras activation in Nf1ec embryos (Fig. 3e). These data suggest that ras signaling is normally
downregulated as endothelial cells mature into valve leaflets. Neurofibromin is required for
this downregulation. It has been suggested that defects in erbB3 and PDGFα receptor
signaling can lead to developmental defects of the endocardial cushions10,11. But the genes
encoding these receptors as well as erbB2, erbB4 and neuregulin are expressed normally in
Nf1-deficient embryos (ref. 5 and M.M. Lakkis and J.A.E., unpublished results). Likewise,
mutations in Sox4, Pax3, Sema3c, Itga4 and members of the Tgfβ family have been

implicated in developmental cardiac defects that include endocardial-cushion
abnormalities12–16. These genes also seem to be expressed normally in Nf1−/− embryos
(E10.5–13.5; M.M. Lakkis, A.D.G., M.M.L. and J.A.E., unpublished results).

Recently, several mouse lines have been generated that exhibit defects in endocardial-
cushion morphogenesis14,17–20. Nfatc1 knockout mice die in utero with hypoplastic
valves17,20. Nfatc1 activity is regulated by phosphorylation and sub-cellular localization.
The ras signaling pathway can affect nuclear localization of Nfat isoforms in myocytes21
and T cells22. An elevated level of ras signaling in Nf1−/− endocardial cells affects Nfatc1
nuclear localization. Nfatc1 was located in the cytoplasm of wild-type endocardial cells at
E9.5 (Fig. 3f). At later time points, it becomes localized to the nucleus17,20. Nfatc1 was
prematurely localized to the nucleus in Nf1−/− endocardial cells at E9.5 (Fig. 3g).
Expression of a constitutively active form of ras in endothelial cells from embryonic
endocardial-cushion explants (Fig. 3h,i) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Fig. 3j,k)
was sufficient to enhance Nfatc1 nuclear localization. We propose that increased ras activity
in neurofibromin-deficient endocardial cells leads to Nfatc1 activation. This may contribute
to the cardiovascular defects seen in mouse embryos lacking Nf1 in endothelial cells and to
vascular defects observed in individuals with NF1, though our data do not exclude the
possible contribution of other downstream pathways regulated by Nf1.

These results show that neurofibromin is required in endothelial cells, but do not rule out a
simultaneous requirement in the neural crest during cardiac development. Because neural-
crest derivatives are affected in individuals with NF1 and in mice with disruption of Nf1
(refs. 3,4,23,24), we used a cre–lox fate-mapping strategy to examine cardiac neural-crest
migration in wild-type and Nf1 mutant embryos25,26. Cardiac neural-crest cells populated
the outflow tract of hearts from E12.5 wild-type and Nf1 mutant embryos (Fig. 4a,b).
Although the gross morphology of hearts from Nf1−/− embryos is abnormal3–5, the
abundance and location of neural-crest cells was similar to that seen in hearts of wild-type
embryos (Fig. 4). Although it is possible that subtle abnormalities of the neural crest exist,
cardiac defects in Nf1−/− mice occurred despite apparently normal neural-crest migration.

To determine if Nf1 function is required in the neural crest, we carried out tissue-specific
Nf1 gene inactivation. We used three independent lines of transgenic mice expressing Cre
recombinase in neural-crest cells. In each case, previous fate-mapping experiments have
confirmed expression of these transgenes in neural-crest cells fated to populate the heart and
other neural-crest derivatives25–27. We examined embryos derived from appropriate
crosses between Nf1flox mice and Mpz–cre (three litters at E13.5), Pax3–cre (six litters at
E13.5, five newborn litters) and Wnt1–cre (five litters at E13.5, six newborn litters).
Because we obtained similar results with all neural-crest transgenic cre lines, we refer to
them collectively as Nf1nc.

Nf1nc embryos were viable throughout gestation, though Nf1−/− littermates are not viable
after E13.5 (refs. 3,4). At birth, 9 of 67 pups (13% versus the expected 12.5%) were Nf1nc.
At E13.5, cardiac development in Nf1nc embryos was normal (Fig. 1d,h,l), but newborn
Nf1nc pups were not normal. Newborn Nf1nc pups were smaller than wild-type (Fig. 5a,b)
and did not initiate normal respiration. Consistent with the tissue-specificity of our Cre-
expressing transgenic mice, there was hyperplasia of tissues of neural-crest origin, including
massively enlarged sympathetic ganglia (Fig. 5d). These abnormal structures, seen in all five
Nf1nc pups examined, consisted of axons that stained for neurofilament and small cell bodies
with large nuclei that expressed tyrosine hydroxylase (data not shown). This morphology is
consistent with ganglioneuroma or ganglioneurosarcoma, which can develop into malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumors28. We observed hyperplastic tissues with similar appearance
adjacent to the lumbar spine and infiltrating the abdominal omentum and the uterus. In all

cases, the adrenal glands were enlarged (Fig. 5f). There was a marked increase in the
number of adrenal medullary cells, suggesting pheochromocytoma, and a thinning and
distortion of the adrenal cortex (Fig. 5e,f). The adrenal medulla is of neural-crest origin, and
the abnormally abundant cells stained for tyrosine hydroxylase (Fig. 5h). In some cases, we
observed cells positive for tyrosine hydroxylase traversing the cortical boundaries (Fig. 5h).
Hence, Nf1nc pups showed hyperplasia of tissues that are affected in individuals with NF1
and provide a useful model for the study of Nf1 and cancer. We conclude that Nf1 function
in the neural crest is not required for normal development of the heart.

Methods
Mouse breeding and genotyping

We genotyped Nf1+/−, Nf1flox, Pax3–cre, Wnt1–cre, Tek–cre, Mpz–cre, Z/EG and
Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Sor (R26R) mice as described previously4,7,8,25–27,29,30. The
institutional animal care and use committee of the University of Pennsylvania approved all
animal protocols.

Histology and immunohistochemistry

Fixation and immunohistochemistry protocols are available at
http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/mcrc. For detection of neurofilament, we used monoclonal
antibody 2H3 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) at a dilution of 1:25. We used
Phosphop44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody E10 (Cell Signaling
Technology) at a dilution of 1:100. To detect Nfatc1, we used monoclonal antibody 7A6 at a
dilution of 1:50 (BD PharMingen).

Endothelial cell culture

We carried out endocardial-cushion explants from E10.5 mouse embryos and subsequent
adenovirus infection as described previously5. We cultured human umbilical vein
endothelial cells in endothelial growth medium (Clonetics) according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines and co-transfected them with 1 µg of pCDNA3-Nfatc1 and either 2 µg of pCMV-
rasV12 or 2 µg of pCMV using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). We analyzed Nfatc1 localization 48
h after transfection.

Ras activation assay

We used the Ras Activation Assay Kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines
and incubated 1 µg of lysate from E11.5 wild-type or Nf1ec mice with 5 µl of a 50% slurry
of Raf-1 RBD (ras assay reagant)–agarose.

Endothelial-specific Nf1 inactivation disrupts heart development. Sections of hearts from
E13.5 wild-type (a,e,i), Nf1−/− (b,f,j), Nf1ec (c,g,k) and Nf1nc (d,h,l) embryos. Outflow tract
endocardial cushions (a–d, blue arrows) and atrioventricular cushions (e–h, blue arrows) and
high-power magnification of left ventricular myocardium (i–l) are shown. The endocardial
cushions of hearts from Nf1ec embryos (c,g) were enlarged and appeared similar to those of
Nf1−/− embryos (b,f). A ventricular septal defect was seen in hearts of both Nf1−/− (f) and
Nf1ec (g) embryos. The compact layer of the myocardium of Nf1ec embryos (k) was thinned,
as it was in Nf1−/− embryos (j), whereas Nf1nc embryos (l) resembled wild-type (i).

Elevated ras signaling and increased Nfatc1 nuclear localization in hearts of Nf1−/−
embryos. a–d, Activated MAPK (arrows) detected by immunohistochemistsry in sections of
outflow tract (a,b) and atrioventricular (c,d) endocardial cushions from E11.5 wild-type (a,c)
and Nf1−/− (b,d) embryos. e, Higher levels of activated ras were present in Nf1ec embryos as
detected by pull-down assay with the ras binding domain of raf. wt, wild-type. f,g, Nfatc1
was localized to the cytoplasm of endothelial cells from E9.5 wild-type (yellow arrow, f)
embryos and to the nucleus in Nf1−/− littermates (yellow arrow, g). h,i, Nfatc1 was in the
cytoplasm of endothelial cells cultured from wild-type endocardial-cushion explants infected
with adenovirus expressing lacZ (h) but in the nucleus of cells infected with rasV12 virus
(i). j,k, Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were transfected with Nfatc1 alone (j) or
Nfatc1 plus rasV12 (k), which resulted in nuclear localization of Nfatc1 (arrow, k).

Fate mapping of cardiac neural crest. a,b, Hearts of E12.5 wild-type (a) and Nf1−/− (b)
embryos stained for β-galactosidase activity. Cardiac neural-crest cells are labeled blue by
Cre-mediated activation of lacZ in R26R reporter mice30. Red arrows point to labeled cells
populating the outflow tract of the developing heart. c,d, Cross-sections through hearts at the
level of the truncus show labeled blue cells forming the septum between the aorta and
pulmonary artery in both wild-type (c) and Nf1−/− (d) embryos. e,f, Red arrows point to
labeled neural-crest cells invading the outflow tract endocardial cushions in the conus region
of the right ventricular outflow tract in wild-type (e) and Nf1−/− (f) embryos. pa, pulmonary
artery; ao, aorta; rv, right ventricle; lv, left ventricle.

Nf1nc mice live longer than Nf1−/−embryos and develop tumors of neural-crest origin. a,b,
Comparison of newborn wild-type (a) and Nf1nc (b) littermates. c,d, Sagittal sections of
newborn pups showed normal sympathetic ganglia in wild-type embryos (arrow, c) and
massively enlarged ganglia in Nf1nc embryos (arrows, d). e–h, Adrenal gland (ad) of wild-
type (e,g) and Nf1nc (f,h) embryos showed hyperplastic adrenal medullary cells reminiscent
of pheochromocytoma in Nf1nc pups. The cells formed a large mass extrinsic to the adrenal
gland (yellow arrows, f). Immunohistochemistry showed medullary (m) cells positive for
tyrosine hydroxylase surrounded by cortex (c) in wild-type embryos (g), whereas cells
positive for tyrosine hydroxylase were seen invading the cortex and surrounding tissues in
Nf1nc embryos (yellow arrows, h).
