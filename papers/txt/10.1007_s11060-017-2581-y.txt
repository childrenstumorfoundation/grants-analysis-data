Abstract  Medulloblastoma (MB) is recognized as com-
prising four molecular subgroups with distinct transcrip-
tional profiles, clinical features, and outcomes. Previous 
studies demonstrate that pediatric MBs present with sub-
group-specific MRI manifestations. We hypothesized that 
combination of anatomical localization and conventional 
features based on MR imaging can predict these subgroups 
in adult MBs. MR Imaging manifestations of 125 adult 
patients with MB were analyzed retrospectively based on 
pre-operative MRI scans. MB molecular subgroups were 
evaluated by the expression profiling array and immuno-
histochemistry. A pediatric MB cohort of 60 patients were 
analyzed for comparison with data of adult patients. Multi-
ple logistic regression analysis revealed that tumor location

(P < 0.0001) and pattern of enhancement (P = 0.0048) were 
significantly correlated with molecular subgroups in adult 
MBs. Ninety-two percent of adult MBs were correctly pre-
dicted by using logistic regression model based on the ana-
tomical localization patterns and pattern of enhancement. 
Exclusively intra-cerebellar growth, localization in the ros-
tral cerebellum, and no brainstem contact were specific to 
adult SHH-MBs. Group 4-MBs in adult were characterized 
by minimal/no enhancement compared with other two sub-
groups. Infant SHH-MBs represented significant different 
localization patterns compared with SHH tumors in children 
and adults. We identified that molecular subgroups of adult 
MBs could be well predicted by tumor localization patterns 
and enhancement pattern. Our study also provided important 
evidence that MB subgroups in adult possibly derived from 
different cellular origins.

Introduction
Medulloblastoma (MB) consists of four molecular sub-
groups (WNT, SHH, group 3, and group 4) with obvious 
differences in clinical outcomes. In pediatric patients, the 
WNT tumors have an excellent prognosis and should be 
treated with reduced radiation/chemotherapy, while Group 
3-MBs and TP53-mutated SHH-MBs have worse outcome 
and need novel therapies [4, 8, 14, 18, 21, 27]. Because of 
the difference in response to therapy, tailored therapy for 
each subgroup is urgently needed. Additionally, MBs in 
adult show significantly different clinical features and out-
comes in comparison to their pediatric counterparts [9, 13, 
19, 26, 27]. In adult, Group 4-MBs are associated with worse

prognosis, while there is no significant difference between 
WNT and SHH-MBs [9, 19, 26].

The molecular classification of MB can provide important 
guidance to clinical treatment, however, it is not routinely 
used in the clinical practice to improve outcomes of patients. 
One of the reasons hampering its use is that the methods 
used for subgrouping require technical optimization: (i) gene 
expression profiling is widely used for MB subgroups analy-
sis, while it is limited by the needs of high quality RNA and 
high cost [10, 15]; (ii) Immunostaining of several markers 
have been proposed to perform subgrouping, however, sev-
eral challenges also remain in making immunohistochem-
istry (IHC) technique common to use in clinical, including 
variability in antibody batches, sample preparation methods, 
staining procedures, and inter-observer reliability [3, 14, 15].
Although imaging manifestations of MB are heterogene-
ous, recent studies demonstrate possible MRI features corre-
late for tumor subgroups in pediatric MBs, and may become 
a surrogate for genomic testing of classification [16, 17, 23, 
25]. Considering its widespread use in clinical practice, MR 
imaging will be a convenient assisted approach if MB clas-
sification could be performed based on MRI. However, due 
to the low incidence, MRI features of adult MB are still not 
well described [1, 12], and whether the MR imaging also 
could be used to predict MB molecular subgroups in adult 
is still not known. Therefore, our study aimed to identify 
possible relation between MRI features and MB biology, and 
to reveal novel hints regarding the origins of MB subgroups 
in adult.

Patients and methods
Patient characteristics

A retrospective institutional data base search was conducted 
with institutional review board of Beijing Tian Tan Hospital 
approval and waiver of consent. All procedures performed 
in studies involving human participants were in accordance 
with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national 
research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration 
and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. 
This article does not contain any studies with animals per-
formed by any of the authors.

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 
125 adult patients (male/female ratio 1.82:1; age range 
18–60 years) with a final pathological diagnosis of MB from 
2003 to 2016 at Beijing Tian Tan Hospital. Patients with 
both pre-operative MR imaging and surgical tissue avail-
able for molecular analysis were included. An independent 
pediatric cohort of 60 MBs (male/female ratio 2.07:1; age 
range 1.2–14 years) with the same with the same inclusion 
criteria was also assembled from Beijing Tian Tan Hospital.

Molecular analysis

In the adult cohort, expression profiling array (n = 13) and 
IHC (n = 112) were used to establish the MB molecular sub-
groups, as we described previously [26]. In the pediatric 
cohort, total RNA (100 ng) from fresh-frozen tissue was 
analyzed using the Panomics QuantiGene Plex 2.0 RNA 
assay system (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Twenty-
two MB subgroup-specific signature genes were selected 
for molecular classification analysis [10]. Two housekeeping 
genes (ACTB and GAPDH) were included for normaliza-
tion. All of the experiments were performed following the 
user manual of QuantiGene Plex Assay (Panomics). Nor-
malized expression ratios were generated by dividing the 
background-subtracted expression values by the geometric 
mean of the housekeeping genes. Unsupervised hierarchi-
cal cluster analysis was used to delineate distinct sample 
clusters.

Imaging technique and analysis

All patients were obtained brain MRI before surgery using 
1.5 or 3T machine (Signa or Discovery 750; General Elec-
tric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The follow-
ing sequences were obtained including axial and coronal T2 
FSE (TR/TE, 2700/100 ms), axial fluid-attenuated inversion 
recovery (TR/TE, 9000/120 ms; inversion time, 2200 ms), 
precontrast T1 spin-echo and contrast-enhanced T1 spoiled 
gradient-recalled echo (TR/TE, 8/3 ms; 1-mm section thick-
ness, 0 skip), followed by 2 planes of contrast enhanced T1 
spin-echo (TR/TE, 600–700/20 ms; 5 mm section thickness, 
0.5 skip). Review and evaluation of the imaging data were 
reviewed independently by three experienced neuroradiolo-
gists (Q.P., X.Z., X.W.), who are blinded to clinical, patho-
logic, and molecular data. Consensus for discordant readings 
was decided chief neuroradiologists (L.A.).

Radiologic evaluation

Based on pre-operative MR imaging, tumor locations were 
defined as cerebellar hemisphere, midline vermis/4th ven-
tricle or cerebellar peduncle/cerebellopontine angle cistern 
(CP/CPA). The anatomical localization patterns, presented 
in previous study [23], were described using spatial dis-
tribution with regard to four compartments: main tumor 
localization of hindbrain compartments, main localization 
in cerebellar compartments, main vertical localization in 
cerebellar compartments, and association with brainstem 
compartments.

The MR imaging features were analyzed including: 
tumor margin, enhancement characteristics, cysts/cavities, 
peritumoral edema, hemorrhage/mineralization, necrosis, 
tumor size and intracranial metastases. Tumor margin was 

1 3J Neurooncol (2017) 135:353–360 

characterized as ill-defined if >50% of the margin could not 
be distinguished from the surrounding cerebellar paren-
chyma based on all imaging sequences. The enhancement 
pattern was defined as minimal/none if <10% was estimated 
to enhance, solid if enhancement was present in more than 
90% of the tumor volume, heterogeneous if varying degrees 
of enhancement were seen in 10–90% of the tumor volume. 
The presence of hemorrhage/ mineralization was evaluated 
by gradient-echo MRI. When gradient-echo imaging was not 
available, CT scan was used to detect areas of hemorrhage/
mineralization.

Neurosurgical evaluation

Intraoperative diagnosis regarding primary tumor locations 
(cerebellar hemisphere, midline vermis/4th ventricle, or CP/
CPA) and areas of brain invasion independently reviewed by 
four neurosurgeons (F.Z., B.W., X.W. and P.L.).

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using statistics soft-
ware (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Statistics, 
Version 20.0; IBM, Armonk, New York) with an a priori 
significance level of P value = 0.01. Statistical analyses were 
performed by using the Fisher exact test, χ2 test and Pearson 
correlation analysis for categoric data. A multivariable logis-
tic regression model was developed to identify significant 
predictors of the MB subgroup. Pseudo R-squared goodness 
of fit ascertained by using the Cox and Snell method.

Results
Tumor staging, histology, and molecular subgroup

In this study, 125 adult MBs consisted of 17 WNT tumors 
(14%), 64 SHH tumors (51%), and 44 Subgroup 4 tumors 
(35%),  and  no  subgroup  3-MB  exited  (Supplementary 
Fig. 1). SHH-MBs in adult occurred predominately in the 
cerebellar hemispheres (69%, 44/64), while 22% (14/64) 
grew in midline vermis/4th ventricle, and 9% (6/64) were 
located the CP/CPA. WNT-MBs mainly located in midline 
vermis/4th ventricle (71%, 12/17), and 29% grew in CP/CPA 
(5/17). All Group 4-MBs (100%, 44/44) located at midline 
vermis/4th ventricle.

Sixty pediatric MBs were classified into four subgroups, 
including 8 WNT-MBs (13%), 17 SHH-MBs (28%), 15 
Group 3-MBs (25%), and 20 Group 4-MBs (33%; Supple-
mentary Fig. 2).

Anatomical localization patterns of adult MBs

We characterized anatomical localization patterns of 125 
adult MBs using pre-operative MRI (Table 1). 69% of SHH-
MBs showed exclusively intra-cerebellar growth and their 
overall distribution differed significantly from other two 
subgroups (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1c, d). Intracerebellar part only 
in hemisphere was characteristic of SHH tumors (40/64, 
63%). In contrast, tumor parts affecting the cerebellum were 
mostly located in the vermis in the Group 4 tumors (36/44, 
81%; Fig. 1e, f), while 47% WNT-MBs (8/17) were grew 
exclusively outside the cerebellum (P < 0.0001). Forty-eight 
percent of the SHH-MBs (31/61) burden exclusively in the 
rostral cerebellum (Fig. 1 c3, d3), but none of the other two 
subgroups had their main tumor burden exclusively in this 
localization (P < 0.0001). We further analyzed the associa-
tion of MBs to different brainstem compartments. Interest-
ingly, WNT-MBs and Group 4-MBs always had brainstem 
contact (Fig. 1a, b, e, f), and tumors mostly contacted both 
the cochlear and cuneate nucleus [75% (11/17) and 82% 
(36/44); respectively]. Conversely, only 25% (16/64) SHH-
MBs had brainstem contact and mainly touched the cochlear 
nucleus (P < 0.0001).

Conventional MRI features of adult MBs

Conventional MRI features of molecular subgroup in adult 
are listed in Table 2. Group 4-MBs were characterized 
by minimal/none enhancement pattern (50%; P < 0.0001; 
Fig. 1f; Supplementary Fig. 4), compared with WNT- and 
SHH subgroups (0 and 9%; respectively). Cyst/cavities was 
predominately characteristic in WNT- and SHH-MBs (70 
and 68%, respectively) groups, but not in Group 4-MBs 
(41%; P = 0.008). Meanwhile, 81% SHH-MBs and 53% 
WNT-MBs showed obvious peritumoral edema in cerebel-
lum or brainstem (Fig. 1a–d), but only 36% Group 4 tumors 
had this feature (P < 0.0001). The other MR imaging fea-
tures, including tumor margin, hemorrhage/ mineralization, 
size, or intracranial seeding, were not characteristic of spe-
cific molecular subgroups.

Models for determining molecular subgroups of adult 
MBs

Multivariable logistic regression showed that locations 
(midline  vermis/4th  ventricle,  cerebellar  hemisphere 
and CP/CPA, P < 0.0001) and pattern of enhancement 
(P = 0.0048) were predictors of adult MB subgroups. Two 
logistic regression models based on different MR imaging 
patterns were used for determining molecular subgroups. 
With the logistic regression model based on location and 
pattern of enhancement, 79% of tumors were appropri-
ately classified, including WNT-MBs (24%), SHH-MBs

(86%)  and  Group  4-MBs  (91%).  This  multivariable 
model demonstrated a goodness of fit as assessed by the 
pseudo R-squared goodness of fit (Cox and Snell method) 
of 0.669. With the logistic regression model based on 
anatomical localization patterns and pattern of enhance-
ment, 92% of tumors were appropriately classified (Sup-
plementary Fig. 3), including WNT-MBs (65%), SHH-
MBs (95%) and Group 4-MBs (98%). The multivariable 
model demonstrated a goodness of fit as assessed by the 
pseudo R-squared goodness of fit (Cox and Snell method) 
of 0.795.

Neurosurgical findings in adult MBs

Surgical inspection regarding the tumor location was 100% 
concordant with the pre-operative MR imaging result. All 
Group 4-MBs (44/44) and 76% WNT-MBs (13/17) expanded 
into the fourth ventricle, whereas only 8% SHH-MBs (5/64) 
grew  intraventricularly  (P < 0.0001).  Meanwhile,  76% 
WNT-MBs (13/17) were found obviously adherent to the 
4th ventricle floor at surgery, compared with only 34% for 
Group-4 MBs (15/44) and none for SHH-MBs (P < 0.0001). 
Interestingly, 59% WNT-MBs (10/17) were found expanded 
into the foramen of Luschka, but only 30% Group-4 MBs 
(13/44) and none for SHH-MBs had the foramen of Luschka 
involved (P < 0.0001).

Anatomical localization patterns and conventional 
features of pediatric MBs

In the pediatric cohort, SHH-, WNT- and Group 4-MBs also 
had significantly different distribution on each localization 
pattern (P < 0.01, respectively; Supplementary Table 1). Of 
all various conventional MRI features, Group 4-MBs were 
also characterized by minimal/none enhancement pattern 
(60%) compared with two other subgroups (P < 0.0001, Sup-
plementary table 2). The other MR imaging features were 
not characteristic of specific molecular subgroups in this 
cohort.

Comparison of localization patterns and features 
between adult and pediatric MBs

Attributed to the same subgroup, there was no significant 
difference of localization patterns or conventional fea-
tures between adult and pediatric MBs (Supplementary 
Table 3–8). Notably, SHH-MBs in infants, children, and 
adults represented distinct anatomical localization obviously 
(Table 3). Most SHH-MBs in children and adults showed 
exclusively intra-cerebellar growth (68, 69%; respectively), 
while only 13% infant SHH-MBs (1/8) grew totally inside 
the cerebellum (P = 0.002). As the tumor parts affecting 
the cerebellum, SHH-MBs in children and adults always 
located in the hemispheres (56 and 63%; respectively).

Contrarily, 50% of infant SHH-MBs (4/8) located in the 
vermis (P = 0.004). Moreover, SHH-MBs in elder patients 
tended to present more often located only in the rostral cer-
ebellum compared with infant SHH-MBs (P = 0.036). In 
addition, there was no significant difference of MRI features 
among three age groups. (Supplementary Table 9).

Discussion
Previous studies in pediatric MBs have demonstrated that 
different molecular subgroups present with specific imag-
ing features [16, 17, 23, 25]. Meanwhile, MR imaging study 
could provide significant insights to the precise cells of ori-
gin of human MB, which have already shown distinctive 
developmental origins of MB molecular subgroups in mice 
[5, 6, 20, 24]. However, due to the rare occurrence, little is 
known about the relationship between molecular subgroups 
and imaging characteristics of adult MBs. To fill the gap, we 
represent the first and largest study, to investigate subgroup- 
specific localization and MRI features in adult MBs. Our 
results demonstrate that most of adult MB subgroups could 
be well distinguished by anatomic localization patterns and 
pattern of enhancement based on MRI.

SHH-MBs in adult present with distinctive localization 
from WNT- and Group 4-MBs. In our study, most SHH-
MBs presented with exclusive intracerebellar growth, espe-
cially with the cerebellar hemisphere involvement. This 
MRI-based specific localization can be a significant predic-
tor for adult SHH-MB (Supplementary Fig. 3). Furthermore, 
we suggest that a majority of adult SHH-MBs may derive 
from intra-cerebellar origins as they may appear without any 
growth out the cerebellum. Our finding may also support 
the prior study that the third population of stem/precursor 
cells—white matter stem cells may be cells of origin of some 
adult MBs [11]. Moreover, all of adult SHH-MBs grew in 
the rostral or rostro-caudal cerebellum, but this was never 
the case in WNT- or Group 4 MBs. These specific locali-
zation patterns evaluate that adult SHH-MBs are distinct 
tumors from other two subgroups and likely have a different 
cell of origin. These results also confirm previous studies 
that granule neuron precursor cells (GNPCs) derived from 
the upper rhombic lip formed SHH-MBs in mice [20, 24].
The spatial distribution of WNT-MBs is heterogeneous 
and still controversial in pediatric MBs. Previous studies 
described that all of pediatric WNT-MBs locate in the mid-
line [5, 22]. Conversely, two recent reports demonstrated 
that WNT tumors mainly occurred along the CP/CPA (50, 
75%) [16, 17]. In our cohort, most of adult WNT-MBs and 
all pediatric WNT-MBs grew in the middle line, only 30% 
adult WNT-MBs located at CP/CPA. The common charac-
teristic of all WNT-MBs in our study was brainstem involve-
ment. This finding can provide the potential evidence that 

359

brainstem precursors could be cells of origin for WNT-MBs. 
In addition, we also found 9% adult SHH-MBs located in 
CP/CPA. Most of them could be distinguish from CP/CPA 
WNT tumors with characteristic of the caudal-cerebellum 
growth.

The origin of Group 4-MBs are less well characterized 
because of its unclear molecular pathogenesis and lack 
of appropriate animal models to study. Interestingly, the 
localization of Group 4-MBs in adult showed remarkable 
consistency (Supplementary Fig. 4). All Group 4 tumors 
grew into the 4th ventricle with both the cochlear and cune-
ate nucleus contact. Meanwhile, most of Group 4 tumors 
occured in specific site with involvement of inferior vermis 
and cisterna magna. Therefore, we hypothesis that the cell 
of origin for Group 4-MBs in adult possibly originate from 
superficial layer cells of tuber vermis or inferior medullary 
velum (Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, we found that 
Group 4 tumors in adult present with minimal/no enhance-
ment and less intratumoral cysts on MR imaging, compared 
with other two subgroups. Based on these, we conclude that 
minimal/no enhancing tumors with both the cochlear and 
cuneate nucleus contact can be well recognized as Group 4 
subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Our study also included a pediatric cohort to make valid 
comparisons between adult and pediatric patients. Although 
localization and features based on MRI were similar between 
adult and pediatric MBs attributed to the same subgroups, 
the significant differences of localization pattern were found 
in age-related SHH-MBs. Infant SHH-MBs always grew in 
vermis and expanded into 4th ventricle, which were particu-
larly specific from SHH-MBs in old patients (>3 years old). 
Furthermore, the childhood and adult SHH-MBs were more 
often located in rostral cerebellum than infant SHH-MBs. 
Since most SHH tumors occur in infant and adult patients, 
our finding proved that adult SHH-MBs are totally different 
from infant SHH-MBs with characteristic localization and 
distinct cellular origin. Previous studies prove that SHH-
MBs are gnomically distinct in infants, children, and adults 
[2, 7, 13]. Recent study identifies four different subtypes of 
SHH MB across different age groups have disparate biology 
and outcomes [2]. Thus, we suggest that different therapeutic 
strategy for adult SHH-MBs are needed in future clinical 
trials and may have the potential for clinical benefit.

Future large-scaled, multi-centered retrospective stud-
ies are needed to further confirm our study, and the tumor 
size should be within a set limit to accurately correlate with 
anatomical localization. A second limitation of our study 
is that the molecular-subgroup were classified by immuno-
histochemistry. To overcome this limitation, future studies 
using fresh frozen tumor tissues followed by real-time PCR 
assay or nanoString assay for molecular analysis are needed 
[10, 15]. In addition, adult Group 3-MBs are not included in 
this study because of rare incidence [8, 19, 26]. The imaging

features of this subgroup in adult are still unknown, and need 
to be analyzed in future studies.

In conclusion, our data identified the specific localization 
and MRI features of MB subgroups in adult, and provided 
evidence for profound implications regarding the differ-
ent cellular origin. As to be the widespread non-invasive 
method for clinical diagnosis in brain tumors, MR imaging 
correlates of each MB subgroup will undoubtedly improve 
benefits of translating molecular classification into clinical 
arena for prognostic evaluation.
