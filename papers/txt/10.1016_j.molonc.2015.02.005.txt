No consensus treatment regime exists beyond surgery for malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumours (MPNST), and the purpose of the present study was to ﬁnd new approaches
to stratify patients with good and poor prognosis and to better guide therapeutic interven-
tion for this aggressive soft tissue cancer.
From a total of 67 MPNSTs from Scandinavian patients with and without neuroﬁbromatosis
type 1, 30 MPNSTs were investigated by genome-wide RNA expression proﬁling and 63
MPNSTs by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, and selected genes were submitted to
analyses of disease-speciﬁc survival.
The potential drug target genes survivin (BIRC5), thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), and topoisom-
erase 2-alpha (TOP2A), all encoded on chromosome arm 17q, were up-regulated in MPNST
as compared to benign neuroﬁbromas. Each of them was found to be independent prog-
nostic markers on the gene expression level, as well as on the protein level. A prognostic
proﬁle was identiﬁed by combining the nuclear expression scores of the three proteins.
For patients with completely resected tumours only 15% in the high risk group were alive
after two years, as compared to 78% in the low risk group.
In conclusion, we found a novel protein expression proﬁle which identiﬁes MPNST pa-
tients with inferior prognosis even after assumed curative surgery. The tested proteins
are drug targets; therefore the expression proﬁle may provide predictive information

Introduction

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) is a rare
and aggressive soft tissue cancer of neuroectodermal origin
(Nielsen et al., 2013; Zhu and Parada, 2002). The disease typi-
cally strikes patients in early adulthood, and nearly half of
the patients are diagnosed with the hereditary genetic disor-
der of von Recklinghausen, neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1).
NF1 is caused by germline mutations in the tumour suppres-
sor gene NF1 which leads to increased signalling through the
RAS/ERK pathway, and inactivating mutations in the NF1
gene is found in both sporadic and NF1-associated MPNST
(Bottillo et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2014). The 5-year overall survival
after an MPNST diagnosis lies in the range between 20 and 50%
(Kolberg et al., 2013), and there are currently no standardized
treatment protocols other than surgery. Due to the rareness of
the disease, systematic clinical trials to obtain robust and sta-
tistically signiﬁcant information about treatment response
among MPNST patients are difﬁcult to perform, and so far,
no conventional chemotherapeutic drugs have shown consis-
tent improvement of disease outcome (Katz et al., 2009).

In addition to NF1 inactivation, alterations of several other
genes and their encoded products have been implicated in the
tumourigenesis of MPNST (Carroll, 2012). Concurrent inactiva-
tion of the genes TP53 and NF1 in mouse models results in the
formation of tumours similar to the MPNSTs seen in humans
(Cichowski et al., 1999; Vogel et al., 1999). The frequency of
TP53 point mutations in human MPNSTs is debated (Nigro
et al., 1989; Lothe et al., 2001; Verdijk et al., 2010), but genomic
loss from chromosome arm 17p, including TP53, is common
(Brekke et al., 2010). Cell cycle genes have been found impli-
cated in MPNST, in particular frequent deletions and rear-
rangements of CDKN2A (Berner et al., 1999; Nielsen et al.,
1999). Two recent high throughput seqencing studies of hu-
man MPNSTs veriﬁed the ﬁndings on NF1, TP53, and CDKN2A,
but in general they showed that there were very few recurrent
mutations in MPNST (Lee et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). A
striking exception was reported for the two genes SUZ12 and
EED, whose gene products are part of the polycomb repressor
complex 2 (PRC2). These were found to be frequently lost or
mutated in both sporadic and NF1 associated MPNST (Lee
et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). Inactivation of PRC2 was shown
to drive differential gene expression, especially for Ras target
genes (De Raedt et al., 2014).

Microarray based studies of MPNSTs have reported charac-
teristic genome and transcriptome patterns, altered activity of
molecular pathways and single gene changes (Holtkamp et al.,
2004; Miller et al., 2006; Rahrmann et al., 2013; Watson et al.,
2004; Yang et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011). A number of miRNAs
have also been found to be differentially expressed (Sedani
et al., 2012). Typical of the referred studies is the limitation

of sample size, and thus, the frequencies of the aberrations
identiﬁed vary among the studies, and conclusive data often
remain unknown. A number of previous studies using FFPE
material have analysed protein expression in MPNST,
including studies on EGFR and ERBB2 expression (Holtkamp
et al., 2008; Keizman et al., 2009; Rahrmann et al., 2014;
Tabone-Eglinger et al., 2008; Zou et al., 2009), TP53 (Brekke
et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2009), BIRC5 (Ghadimi
et al., 2012; Tabone-Eglinger et al., 2008), TOP2A (Skotheim
et al., 2003), as well as FOXM1, MYC and SOX5 (Yu et al.,
2011). In several of these studies, an association was found be-
tween protein expression and prognosis. However, the num-
ber of patients included is still a challenge, the end-points
used varies among studies and the stage of the disease at sam-
pling is not always referred, and therefore, the clinical use of
these prognostic data remain absent.

MPNSTs often show complex karyotypes, with chromo-
some 17 as one of the most frequently altered chromosomes
(Brekke et al., 2010; Lothe et al., 1996; Mertens et al., 2000;
Schmidt et al., 1999; Yu et al., 2011). Deletions of chromosome
arm 17p and the proximal part of 17q, containing the TP53 and
NF1 genes, respectively, are frequently observed in both spo-
radic and NF1-associated MPNST (Fletcher et al., 1999; Koga
et al., 2002a, 2002b; Legius et al., 1993; Lothe et al., 1995;
Menon et al., 1990), whereas gain or ampliﬁcation at the distal
part of 17q is even more common, found in 40e70% of all
MPNSTs (Brekke et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2000; Yu et al.,
2011).

Here, we aimed to identify clinically useful prognostic bio-
markers, which may contribute to improved treatment design
and outcome for MPNST patients, by performing genome-
wide RNA expression analysis followed by investigating up-
regulated genes at 17q that encode proteins representing pu-
tative treatment targets.

Material and methods

2.1.

Patients and samples

Fresh frozen tumour tissue from eight neuroﬁbromas and 30
MPNSTs (17 with NF1 and 13 with sporadic disease), and
formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE)
tissue material
from 63 MPNST patients (28 NF1 and 35 sporadic; 25 overlap-
ping with the fresh frozen samples) was obtained from pa-
tients who were diagnosed during 1980e2002 at reference
sarcoma centres at Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden,
and the Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital,
Oslo, Norway (Brekke et al., 2009) according to the guidelines
given by the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (Nielsen et al.,
2013). A part of the samples were also evaluated by the CHAMP

study group of pathologists (Mertens et al., 2000). Clinical data
are summarized in Table 1. The study was approved by the
South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority and the
Regional Ethics Committee at Lund University according to
national legislation.

2.2.

RNA isolation



RNA was isolated from fresh frozen tissue samples by stan-
dard Trizol methodology. Samples were grinded in a mortar
with liquid nitrogen and further dissolved and homogenized
with a pellet pestle mortar in 1 ml Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), followed by phase separation by chloroform and
precipitation using 2-propanol. The RNA pellets were dis-
C. The RNA concentration
solved in RNase free water at 55
was measured by UV spectroscopy (NanoDrop 1000, Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) and quality was deter-
mined by using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technol-
ogies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 32 of 38 samples had a RIN-value
of 7 or better. Three samples had RIN-values 3e5, however
these were still included based on the ﬁnal evaluation of the
quality parameters from the gene expression array data and
the clustering of these samples with the other MPNST samples
(see Figure 1A).

2.3.

Gene expression analysis

Gene expression analysis was performed using the Applied
Biosystems 1700 microarray platform and the Human Genome
Survey Microarray V2.0 containing 32,878 unique 60-mer oligo-
nucleotide probes (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies,
Foster City, CA). From each sample, 2 mg RNA was ampliﬁed,
labelled and hybridized as described in the manufacturer’s
protocol. For the initial data analysis we used the ABarray soft-
ware
(http://bioconductor.org/packages/1.9/bioc/
html/ABarray.html) to run quality check and basic statistical
analysis. Quantile normalized and log2 transformed expres-
sion data were used in our downstream statistical analysis.

Flag values were replaced by using the Signiﬁcance Analysis
of Microarrays Excel Add-in application (version 3.02; http://
www-stat.stanford.edu/wtibs/SAM/) and the k nearest neigh-
bours algorithm (k ¼ 10). Probes with signal-to-noise ratios
less than three in half of the samples and probes with ﬂagged
intensity values in more than 20% of the samples were
removed, leaving us with a dataset containing measurements
from 18,796 probes available at the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, Series GSE66743).
Gene expression intensity values were centred over the me-
dian value across all samples. We used the ABI Human
Genome Survey Microarray Version 2 annotation ﬁle from
GEO (platform GPL2986) for downstream analysis, and the
12,484 probes annotated by Entrez Gene ID’s were included.
SAM application and t-test statistics with a two class unpaired
response format were used to test for the signiﬁcance of differ-
entially expressed genes between deﬁned groups. Principal
component analysis was performed in Partek Genomics Suite
6.6 (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). Gene set enrichment ana-
lyses were performed using the internet tools provided on the
DAVID website (Huang et al., 2009).

2.4.

Immunohistochemistry



In situ protein expression analysis performed on 4 mm sec-
tions of the TMA was done according to the DAKO Envision
protocol (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) as described (Brekke
et al., 2009), with the following adjustments: for the TOP2A
antibody (NCL-TOPOIIA, Novocastra, USA, 1:5 dilution),
heat induced epitope retrieval was performed in a pressure
C in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) according
cooker for 1 min at 120
to the manufacturer’s recommendation; for the BIRC5 anti-
body (ab469, Abcam, Cambridge, UK, 1:400) and the TK1
antibody (ab57757, Abcam, 1:100) epitope retrieval was per-
formed by heating in a microwave oven for 5 min at 850 W
followed by 15 min at 100 W. Citrate buffer (pH 6$0) was
used for BIRC5, and TriseEDTA buffer (pH 9.0) was used
for TK1.
The stained TMA sections were scanned at 400 magniﬁ-
cation using the Nano-Zoomer Digital Pathology scanner
(Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu,
Japan). Scoring
was done by two of the authors independently (MK and MH)
and quality controlled by a reference pathologist (BD). Nuclear
and cytoplasmic staining was scored from 0 to 5 according to
the distribution of positive cells (0 ¼ 0%, 1 ¼ <1%, 2 ¼ 1e10%,
3 ¼ 11e33%, 4 ¼ 34e66%, and 5 ¼ 67e100%), and from 0 to 2 ac-
cording to staining intensity (0 ¼ negative, 1 ¼ weak, and
2 ¼ strong). The group sizes and survival properties for the pa-
tients in each of these staining categories were analysed indi-
vidually, and two ﬁnal categories were assigned before
downstream analyses (see Supplementary Figure 4).

The target speciﬁcity of the antibodies was tested on West-
ern blots as previously described (Brekke et al., 2009) in two
MPNST cell lines (ST88-14 and STS26T) and a panel of cell lines
from several other cancer types (Supplementary Figure S1).
The MPNST cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Nancy Rat-
ner. The identity of the cell lines was validated by genotyping
in our lab according to the protocol of the AmpFLSTR Identi-
ﬁler PCR Ampliﬁcation Kit (Applied Biosystems), and the geno-
types are available upon request.

Statistical analysis

Comparison of gene expression among patients with high or low
protein expression was done using ManneWhitney U test.
Disease-speciﬁc survival curves were analysed using the
KaplaneMeier method and the Breslow test was used to compare
the equality of the survival functions. For ordinal parameters

with more than two categories, the P-value for linear trend is pre-
sented. Finally, we used Cox proportional hazards regression
modelling with Wald test to provide univariate and multivariate
hazard-ratios (HR) and conﬁdence intervals (CI), and we deﬁned
distinct clinical subgroups of MPNST based on these results. All
statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software
version PASW 18.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).

Results

Differentially expressed genes in MPNST vs

3.1.
neuroﬁbromas

Gene expression values were included for 12,484 probes in 30
MPNSTs and eight neuroﬁbromas. The overall gene expres-
sion in the neuroﬁbromas was clearly different from that in
the majority of the MPNSTs (Figure 1A). A two-class unpaired
SAM analysis of the gene expression proﬁles identiﬁed 437 of
the 12,484 genes as down-regulated in MPNST compared with
neuroﬁbromas, and 345 genes as up-regulated, using a false
discovery threshold of 1% (Q  0.01). The top 100 up- and
down-regulated genes are listed in Supplementary Table S1A
and S1B, respectively.

Functional annotation clustering of the signiﬁcantly differ-
entially expressed genes between MPNST and neuroﬁbromas
showed the strongest enrichment of genesets containing cell
cycle, cell division and kinetocore/chromosome-condensation
associated genes (Supplementary Table S2A). The most signiﬁ-
cantly enriched pathway genesets (KEGG pathways) included
extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, complement/
cell
coagulation cascade,
cycle, and DNA replication
(Supplementary Table S2B).

Since MPNSTs typically have a high degree of DNA copy
number alterations, we also investigated genesets according
to the chromosomal distribution, and we found that up-
regulated genes in MPNST were overrepresented on chromo-
some arms 17q, 6p, 4q, and 9q, while they were underrepre-
sented on 11q, 22q, 21q, and 11p (Figure 1B). 17q was the
region with the strongest enrichment of up-regulated genes,
harbouring 9.5% of these genes as compared to the expected
4.5% (Binominal distribution test, cumulative probability:
P (X  9.5%) ¼ 8$10
 5 (Figure 1C)). Among the 100 most up-
regulated genes, eight were encoded on 17q: TOP2A (rank 2),
BIRC5 (rank 3), COL1A1 (rank 32), NME1 (rank 64), CACNA1G
(rank 66), TK1 (rank 75), CDC6 (rank 80), and PRR11 (rank97)
(Supplementary Table S1A). BIRC5 and TK1 are represented
by two different probes on the AB1700 oligonucleotide array
that recognize alternative transcript variants, where Probe#1
represents the reference transcript in both cases.

We were not able to identify any signiﬁcant differences in
gene expression between MPNSTs from patients with NF1
and from non-NF1 patients; all genes had a Q-value above
0.25 (data not shown).

3.2.

Clinical outcome by gene expression levels

In Kaplan-Meyer analyses including 29 MPNST patients, ﬁve of
the eight genes on chromosome arm 17q identiﬁed in the pre-
vious section, BIRC5, CDC6, NME1, TK1, and TOP2A, showed a
signiﬁcant association with disease outcome when the pa-
tients were dichotomized above or below median expression
across all samples (Supplementary Figure S2). We also per-
formed an unbiased genome wide Cox regression analysis
for 10 years survival including 3340 genes on the AB1700 array
that had a standard deviation across all MPNST samples of
more than 1. The 43 genes that obtained an absolute d-score
2 are listed in the Supplementary Tables S3A and S3B, in

addition to the eight 17q genes identiﬁed in the previous sec-
tion. The three genes BIRC5, TK1, and TOP2A were the only 17q
genes that obtained a Q-value below 0.25, and these were
selected for further validation on the protein level.

Differential expression of proteins BIRC5, TK1, and

3.3.
TOP2A in MPNST tissue

Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein expression of BIRC5, TK1,
and TOP2A was analysed by IHC on TMA sections containing
tissue samples from 63 MPNSTs (representative samples are
shown in Figure 2). Grouping of tumour samples into two ﬁnal
categories with high and low staining is explained in section
3.4. below.

We analysed the association between gene expression and
protein expression (ManneWhitney U test) and found that
samples with high levels of nuclear TOP2A and nuclear
BIRC5 had signiﬁcantly higher gene expression levels of the
corresponding genes, while nuclear TK1 was weakly associ-
ated with TK1 gene expression (Supplementary Figure S3).
No signiﬁcant associations were found between gene expres-
sion and cytoplasmic staining (data not shown). For this
reason, and because nuclear staining is easier to score in a
routine clinical setting, cytoplasmic staining was not included
in subsequent analysis. The staining distribution and inten-
sity scores
staining are summarized in
Supplementary Table S4. There were no statistically

3.4.
TOP2A protein expression

For BIRC5 and TK1 both increasing number of positive nuclei
(staining distribution) and increasing staining intensity were
associated with worse prognosis, and two ﬁnal IHC categories
of tumour samples with high or low staining were deﬁned
by the sum of
the distribution and intensity score
(Supplementary Figure S4A and B). For TOP2A, only staining
distribution was associated with prognosis, therefore the
two ﬁnal IHC categories were deﬁned by the percentage of
positive nuclei only (Supplementary Figure S4C). High staining
for BIRC5, TK1, and TOP2A showed signiﬁcant association to
poor disease-speciﬁc survival in univariate Kaplan Meier and

Cox regression analyses (Figure 3, Table 2). Multivariate Cox
regression analysis showed that
there was redundancy
among the different proteins, as none of the individual pro-
teins remained signiﬁcant (Table 2), although the overall Cox
model of the three proteins was signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.02). Howev-
er, we found that when the patients were stratiﬁed by high or
low nuclear staining of BIRC5, TOP2A added signiﬁcant prog-
nostic information to substratify the patients with low
BIRC5, whereas TK1 added signiﬁcant prognostic information
to the patients with high BIRC5 expression in their tumours
(Figure 4A). Thus, the two combinations low BIRC5/low
TOP2A and high BIRC5/low TK1 predicted good outcome,
while the combinations low BIRC5/high TOP2A and high
BIRC5/high TK1 predicted poor outcome (HR: 3.92; 95% CI:
1.79e8.57; Table 3; Figure 4B). This proﬁle, referred to as an
IHC risk proﬁle, was independently signiﬁcant when adjusted
for patient age, gender, tumour size, site, grade, NF1-status,

and surgical remission (HR: 4.60; 95% CI: 1.47e14.4; Table 3).
Among the 35 patients with complete surgical resection,
only 15% in the high risk group were alive two years after
MPNST diagnosis, as compared to 78% in the low risk group.
Even after ten years, 70% were still alive in the low risk group
(Figure 4C). All other combinations of the three proteins were
also tested, but these combinations did not separate the pa-
tients into equally distinct prognostic groups.

For 24 patients with matching IHC and CNV data, the per-
centage of patients with copy number gain on chromosome
arm 17q was slightly, but not signiﬁcantly, higher in the high
risk group as compared to the low risk group (86 vs 65%, P¼ 0.6).

Discussion and conclusions

Discussion

MPNSTs are highly aggressive neoplasms with no recommen-
ded treatment options beside surgery. In a recent review and

meta-analysis (Kolberg et al., 2013), we found that the
outcome from NF1-associated MPNST has improved slightly
over the last decades, whereas no improvement was seen
for sporadic cases; the ﬁve-year overall survival is now close
to 50% for both patient groups. In order to improve MPNST
outcome, biomarkers that identify high risk patients are
needed, as well as novel drug targets in order to offer these pa-
tients targeted treatment. A handful of studies have described
potential drug targets in MPNST (Ghadimi et al., 2012;
Holtkamp et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2012; Peacock et al., 2013;
Wu et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2011), but very few have been vali-
dated in independent series, and none has so far been imple-
mented in clinical use.

The gene expression data presented in this study reveal
many potential markers for MPNST beyond the 17q genes
we have focused on here; some of them have been suggested
by earlier studies. Miller and colleagues highlighted CNP,
PMP22, and NGFR as down-regulated, and SOX9 and TWIST1
as up-regulated in MPNST as compared to benign Schwann
cells (Miller et al., 2006). These ﬁndings could be veriﬁed in

our data, with the exception of SOX9, and PMP22 was found
among our top 100 down-regulated hits. Levy and co-
workers found that Tenascin XB (TNXB) was down-regulated
in MPNST vs plexiform and dermal neuroﬁbromas, while
Tenascin C (TNC ) was up-regulated (Levy et al., 2007). Our
data conﬁrm these ﬁndings, and interestingly TNXB was the
28th gene on our top 100 down-regulated list. TNC was also
identiﬁed as up-regulated in MPNST by Karube and colleagues
(Karube et al., 2006), along with keratin 18 (KRT18), survivin
(BIRC5), and the collagen VIa3 (COL6A3), while IGFBP6 was re-
ported to be down-regulated, all these ﬁndings are in agree-
ment with our data and IGFBP6 was even found on our top
100 down-regulated list. In a recent study, AURKA was identi-
ﬁed as overexpressed in MPNST (Patel et al., 2012), and a mod-
erate overexpression was also seen in our samples. EGFR has
been found to be up-regulated in MPNST in several previous
studies (Holtkamp et al., 2008; Rahrmann et al., 2014;
Tabone-Eglinger et al., 2008), but this was not conﬁrmed in
our samples. However, a high percentage of MPNSTs have pre-
viously been shown to lack expression of EGFR (Watson et al.,
2004), and it is possible that EGFR is important for tumourigen-
esis in only a subset of these tumours, supported by the
ﬁnding that only about 35% of MPNSTs have increased gene
dosage of EGFR (Brekke et al., 2010; Du et al., 2013; Holtkamp
et al., 2008), therefore we need a higher number of tumour

samples than included in the present study to determine the
role of EGFR in MPNSTs. On our top 100 list of up-regulated
genes in MPNST only one gene has a higher ranking than
BIRC5 and TOP2A, KIAA0101, the importance of this gene is
not further validated in this study, and to our knowledge it
has not been described in MPNST previously. However,
KIAA0101 has been identiﬁed as upregulated and a potential
prognostic marker in several studies on other cancer types
(Xie et al., 2014), and might also prove to be important in
tumorigenesis of MPNST in the future.

From the current transcriptome data we found that chromo-
some arm 17q has the highest relative amount of up-regulated
genes, and several of these genes carried prognostic informa-
tion. We have previously found that chromosome arm 17q
was one of the most frequently gained genomic regions in
MPNST (Brekke et al., 2010; Lothe et al., 1996), and we and others
have suggested that increased tumour mRNA levels of the two
genes TOP2A and BIRC5 have the potential to be markers for
poor prognosis in MPNST (Ghadimi et al., 2012; Karube et al.,
2006; Kresse et al., 2008; Levy et al., 2004; Peacock et al., 2013;
Skotheim et al., 2003; Storlazzi et al., 2006). A high level of
TOP2A protein has also been shown to be associated with
poor outcome (Skotheim et al., 2003). Although prognostic
gene expression proﬁles and PCR based tests have been sug-
gested for many cancers, very few have found their way into

M O L E C U L A R O N C O L O G Y 9 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 1 1 2 9 e1 1 3 9

1137

clinical practice. We therefore aimed to develop an IHC test that
can immediately be used in routine labs.

Nuclear staining is best suited for reproducible visual
scoring, and we identiﬁed a prognostic proﬁle deﬁned by nu-
clear expression of the three 17q encoded proteins BIRC5,
TOP2A and TK1, all of which are also potential drug targets.
Topoisomerases are essential components of the DNA replica-
tion machinery where they are responsible for controlling and
altering the topology of the DNA. Clinical trials with etoposide
for MPNST have shown promising results (Kinebuchi et al.,
2005; Steins et al., 2002), and primary data collection for a
phase II study using this drug in combination with ifosfamide,
doxorubicin, and radiation therapy was recently completed,
but the ﬁnal results are still pending (www.clinicaltrials.gov;
NCT00304083). Single agent topoisomerase inhibitors are un-
likely to have a strong effect on survival, given the experience
from use of these drugs in soft-tissue sarcomas including
MPNST for decades. However, therapy using TK1 or BIRC5 in-
hibitors in treatment of MPNST has not been explored to our
knowledge, and combination therapy including such inhibi-
tors might prove successful.

The antiapoptotic protein BIRC5, also known as survivin,
has previously been proposed as a potential drug target in
MPNST (Karube et al., 2006), and a series of strategies directed
against BIRC5 are currently in clinical trials in other cancer
types, including antisense oligonucleotides, immunotherapy,
and small molecule inhibitors (Ryan et al., 2009; Sioud et al.,
2013). In addition, MPNST cell lines treated with the survivin
inhibitor sepantronium bromide (YM155) showed reduced
proliferation (Ghadimi et al., 2012). In support of our ﬁnding,
a recent study found that high mRNA levels of BIRC5 was asso-
ciated with poor outcome in paediatric MPNST (Alaggio et al.,
2013). It should be noted that in one previous study, high levels
of BIRC5 were also observed in benign tumours of the periph-
eral nervous system, schwannomas and neuroﬁbromas
(Sasaki et al., 2002), in contrast to our results.

For some time, viral TK1 has served as a target in treatment
of a number of virus-induced diseases using drugs such as
zidovudine (AZT), acyclovir, and ganciclovir. TK1-directed
treatment has proven so effective that attempts have also
been made to introduce viral TK1 into cancer cells by gene
therapy followed by exposure to the antiviral drugs (Oliveira
et al., 2012; Packer et al., 2000). TK1 is also an important acti-
vator of the prodrug intermediate 5’-ﬂuorodeoxyuridine (5-
FdU) to the cytotoxic 5’-ﬂuorodeoxyuridine monophosphate
(5-FdUMP), which is a suicide substrate for thymidylate syn-
thetase (TYMS). A high serum level of TK1 has been demon-
strated to be a marker of poor prognosis for several cancers
(Aufderklamm et al., 2012), including breast cancer, colorectal
cancer, lung cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The ﬁnding
of high levels of TK1 in MPNSTs from patients with poor prog-
nosis suggests that drugs directed towards TK1, or that
are activated by TK1, may be useful for treatment of these
patients.

4.2.

Conclusions

In this study, we identiﬁed three molecular markers, BIRC5,
TK1 and TOP2A that signiﬁcantly stratify patients into a
good and poor prognostic group both on the mRNA and

protein level. Furthermore, as BIRC5, TK1 and TOP2A are
drug targets, future clinical trials for MPNST patients could
be designed to explore the beneﬁt of targeting these markers
using their combined protein expression to predict treatment
response.
