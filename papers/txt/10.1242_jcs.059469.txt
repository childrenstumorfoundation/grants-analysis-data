Summary
Organization of the plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells is accomplished by the specific localization of transmembrane or
membrane-associated proteins, which are often linked to cytoplasmic protein complexes, including the actin cytoskeleton. In this study,
we identified Sip1 as a Drosophila orthologue of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) binding protein 50 (EBP50; also known as the Na+/H+
exchanger  regulatory  factor  NHERF1).  In  mammals,  EBP50/NHERF1  is  a  scaffold  protein  required  for  the  regulation  of  several
transmembrane receptors and downstream signal transduction activity. In Drosophila, loss of Sip1 leads to a reduction in Slik kinase
protein abundance, loss of Moesin phosphorylation and changes in epithelial structure, including mislocalization of E-cadherin and F-
actin. Consistent with these findings, Moesin and Sip1 act synergistically in genetic-interaction experiments, and Sip1 protein abundance
is dependent on Moesin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Sip1 forms a complex with both Moesin and Slik. Taken
together, these data suggest that Sip1 promotes Slik-dependent phosphorylation of Moesin, and suggests a mechanism for the regulation
of Moesin activity within the cell to maintain epithelial integrity.

Introduction
Establishment  and  maintenance  of  epithelial  integrity  through
specification  of  apical-basal  cell  polarity,  organization  of  the
cytoskeleton and establishment of adhesive junctions is essential
for  the  development  and  function  of  all  metazoans.  The
cytoskeleton is particularly important for organization of the cell
membrane via linkage to transmembrane or membrane-associated
proteins.  In  turn,  this  organization  is  required  to  regulate  both
epithelial integrity and signaling pathways that control cell fate
and cell proliferation. Notably, disruption of epithelial integrity
and  polarity  are  initial  steps  in  the  progression  towards
tumorigenesis (Mullin, 2004).

Mammalian ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM), which are three
paralogous proteins, interact with both transmembrane proteins and
the actin cytoskeleton within specific domains of the cell cortex to
organize  the  plasma  membrane  (Amieva  et  al.,  1994;  Bretscher,
2002; Franck et al., 1993). Examples of this role include localization
of  ezrin  to  apical  microvilli  in  epithelial  cells  of  the  developing
intestine (Berryman et al., 1993; Berryman et al., 1995; Saotome
et al., 2004), enrichment of radixin in the microvilli of liver bile
canaliculi (Amieva et al., 1994) and localization of moesin to the
membrane of endothelial cells and some polarized epithelial cells
(Berryman et al., 1993). ERM proteins include several functional
domains including the N-terminal 4.1 ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM)
domain, a coiled-coiled region and a C-terminal actin-binding region
(Bretscher,  2002).  They  are  generally  thought  to  have  a  role  in
regulating epithelial integrity via linkage with the actin cytoskeleton
(Bretscher, 2002; Speck et al., 2003), but other studies also point
to a role in regulation of signaling pathways (e.g. RhoA) that control

cytoskeletal assembly and organization (Speck et al., 2003). ERM
proteins are regulated by intramolecular interactions between the
N-terminal  FERM  domain  and  C-terminal  domain  (Bretscher,
2002; Gary and Bretscher, 1993; Gary and Bretscher, 1995; Nguyen
et  al.,  2001),  which  in  turn  are  regulated  in  part  by  changes  in
phosphorylation (Berryman et al., 1995; Bretscher, 1989; Hirao et
al., 1996; Matsui et al., 1998; Matsui et al., 1999; Nakamura et al.,
1995; Nakamura et al., 1999; Pietromonaco et al., 1998; Reczek
and  Bretscher,  1998;  Simons  et  al.,  1998).  For  example,
phosphorylation  of  the  conserved  C-terminal  threonine  (T558  in
moesin) residue is required for activation of ERM proteins and thus
regulates their ability to interact with other binding partners (Matsui
et al., 1998). In Drosophila, phosphorylation of this conserved Thr
residue is dependent on the sterile 20 family kinase Slik (Carreno
et al., 2008; Hipfner et al., 2004; Kunda et al., 2008), although the
kinase responsible has not been identified definitively in mammalian
cells (Belkina et al., 2009; Hipfner et al., 2004; Matsui et al., 1998;
Matsui et al., 1999; Oshiro et al., 1998; Pietromonaco et al., 1998;
Yokoyama et al., 2005).

EBP50/NHERF1is a membrane-cytoskeletal linking protein that
is  localized  to  the  apical  surface  of  mammalian  epithelial  cells
(Fouassier  et  al.,  2001;  Kreimann  et  al.,  2007;  Weinman  and
Shenolikar,  1993;  Weinman  et  al.,  1995).  Although  originally
identified as a regulator of the Na+/H+ exchanger, subsequent studies
have shown that EBP50/NHERF1 interacts with ERM proteins and
can  serve  as  a  scaffold  to  link  them  to  the  cytoplasmic  tail  of
transmembrane proteins, as well as to other membrane-associated
cytoplasmic proteins such as PDZK1 (Gisler et al., 2003; Morales
et al., 2004; Reczek et al., 1997). Thus, EBP50/NHERF1 is believed

to have a key role in ERM-mediated membrane organization. Loss
of heterozygosity for EBP50/NHERF1 has been reported to occur
in  over  50%  of  breast  tumours,  and  EBP50/NHERF1  mutations
are  associated  with  tumour  aggressiveness,  suggesting  that
EBP50/NHERF1 has tumour-suppressor functions (Dai et al., 2004;
Pan et al., 2006). Interestingly, there is also evidence from breast
tumour cell lines that overexpression and mislocalization of ezrin is
correlated with invasiveness (Elliott et al., 2005; Sarrio et al., 2006).
To  better  understand  the  functional  relationship  between
EBP50/NHERF1 and ERM proteins, we have characterized the role
of Drosophila Sip1, an EBP50/NHERF1 orthologue. Specifically,
we have tested the in vivo functions of Sip1 in relation to the sole
ERM orthologue, Moesin, in flies. We show that Sip1 is required
for  the  normal  localization  and  abundance  of  Slik  kinase,  the
activation of Moesin and the abundance of E-cadherin (Shotgun in
Drosophila) and F-actin. On the basis of these results, we propose
that  Sip1  functions  with  Slik  kinase  to  promote  phosphorylation
and activation of Moesin to regulate epithelial integrity.

Results
Sip1 is a Drosophilaorthologue of the mammalian
EBP50/NHERF1 protein
Sip1  was  identified  in  a  yeast  two-hybrid  interaction  screen
(Formstecher  et  al.,  2005)  as  a  protein  that  binds  to  a  Moesin
construct containing either the FERM domain alone or to one that
lacks the C-terminal actin-binding domain. The interacting region
of Sip1 delineated by interaction with the two Moesin fragments
corresponds to residues 217-296, a region that is C-terminal to the
PDZ domain of Sip1 (Fig. 1). This interaction domain was defined
as the region of overlap of a total of 13 Sip1 clones found in the
two screens (data not shown).

A BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) search of the human protein
Refseq database using the Drosophila Sip1 protein sequence as a
query  reported  that  the  closest  human  homologues  were
EBP50/NHERF1  and  NHERF2.  Drosophila Sip1  was  slightly
more similar to human NHERF1 based on the fact that the single
PDZ  domain  in  Sip1  is  57%  identical  and  81%  similar  to
EBP50/NHERF1 PDZ domain 2, compared with 45% identical and
60% similar to human EBP50/NHERF1 PDZ domain 1 (Fig. 1).
By comparison, Drosophila Sip1 was 53% identical (73% similar)
and 40% identical (57% similar) to human NHERF2 PDZ domain
2 and domain 1, respectively (Fig. 1). A reciprocal BLAST search,
using the human EBP50/NHERF1 against the Drosophila protein
database, found that Sip1 had the most significant alignments. A
sequence alignment of the PDZ domain of Sip1 was compared with
PDZ1  and  PDZ2  domains  from  human,  mouse,  rat  and
Caenorhabditis elegans (supplementary material Fig. S1). The C-
terminal  region  or  ‘EB  domain’  of  EBP50/NHERF1,  which  has
previously been shown to bind ezrin in mammals (Fig. 1) (Finnerty
et al., 2004; Reczek and Bretscher, 1998) is also conserved in Sip1.
There was 23% identity (61% similarity) between the EB domain
of  Sip1  and  human  EBP50/NHERF1  (Fig.  1  and  supplementary
material Fig. S1). There was 28% identity (67% similarity) between
the  EB  domain  of  Sip1  and  human  NHERF2  (Fig.  1).  The  high
degree of similarity in the PDZ and EB domains suggests that Sip1
is  a  Drosophila orthologue  of  EBP50/NHERF1  and  that  these
domains  in  Sip1  will  probably  adopt  similar  structures  to  their
mammalian counterparts.

We identified a P-element insertion allele, Sip106373 (Spradling
et al., 1999) that displays homozygous lethality just before, or shortly
after, embryonic hatching to the larval state. Animals homozygous

(NP_524712) protein with human EBP50/NHERF1 (NP_004243) and
NHERF2 (NP_001123484). Drosophila Sip1 (CG10939) contains only a
single N-terminal PDZ domain (shaded region), which is most similar to the
second PDZ domain in human EBP50/NHERF1. The percentage amino acid
identity and similarity are indicated between the PDZ domains by vertical
arrows. The percentage identity and similarity between the EB domain of Sip1
and human EBP50/NHERF1 is indicated by vertical arrows. The C-terminal

and Moesin is indicated by the dark horizontal line (Y2H).

for  the  Sip106373 allele  are  fully  rescued  to  the  adult  stage  by
expressing a UAS-Sip1 transgene under the control of the T80Gal4
driver. T80Gal4 is expressed ubiquitously throughout development
starting at embryonic stage 11 (Hrdlicka et al., 2002). This result
suggests  that  the  P-element  insertion  specifically  affects  Sip1
function.

To better examine Sip1 function, we raised a polyclonal antibody
that specifically recognizes this protein (Fig. 2). Within the developing
embryonic  epithelia,  Sip1  partially  overlaps  with  the  plasma
membrane with some cytoplasmic staining. In contrast to the septate
junction marker coracle, Sip1 is not highly associated with the plasma
membrane (Fig. 2A-C). Sip1 staining was not apparent in Sip106373
embryos  (Fig.  2D-F)  indicating  that  this  is  a  strongly  inactivating
mutation  and  that  the  antibody  is  specific  to  Sip1  protein.  Upon
immunoblot analysis, Sip1 protein was found to be absent in Sip106373
embryos (data not shown). Interestingly, we observed very intense
Sip1 staining in the apical region of the hindgut epithelium, which
was reminiscent of the expression pattern of EBP50/NHERF1 in renal
epithelial cells (Ingraffea et al., 2002; Morales et al., 2004) (Fig. 2G-
I).  Similarly,  in  the  wing  imaginal  epithelium,  Sip1  was  localized
apically and overlapped with F-actin staining (Fig. 2J-L). In embryos,
Sip1  and  Moesin  staining  overlapped  at  the  apical  membrane,  as
would be expected if these two proteins interact (Fig. 2M-O). Sip1
protein was also localized to the apical membrane in epithelial follicle
cells (supplementary material Fig. S2A-C) and colocalized with the
pattern of phosphorylated Moesin staining (supplementary material
Fig. S2).

Genetic interactions between Sip1 and Moesin
To  investigate  the  functional  relationship  between Sip1  and  Moe
(the gene encoding Moesin) we tested genetic interactions between
mutations of Sip1 and Moe. Expression of a UAS-Moe transgene
under  control  of  the  MS1096  GAL4 driver,  which  is  expressed
throughout  the  dorsal  surface  of  the  wing,  had  no  discernable
phenotype  (Fig.  3B).  However,  when  a  UAS-inducible  Sip1
expression  line,  EP2037,  was  expressed  using  this  Gal4  driver,
cuticular vesicles were formed along the L3 wing vein (Fig. 3E,
arrowhead) and some ectopic vein material was observed (Fig. 3E,
arrow).  These  vesicles  suggest  that  cells  expressing  Sip1 are

staining is lost in Sip1 embryos (E), suggesting that this Sip1 allele is
a null mutation and that the antibody is specific. The gain and black
level settings are identical in B and E. (G-I) Within the embryonic
hindgut, there is bright Sip1 staining (H) that colocalizes with
Moesin at the apical membrane (I). Sip1 protein is also expressed in
third instar larval imaginal discs (K) where it colocalizes with
filamentous actin (L) staining, and is apical to coracle (not shown).

extruded from the wing epithelium (Gibson and Perrimon, 2005).
Immunoblots  and  RT-PCR  confirmed  that  the  EP2037 line
expressed Sip1 upon induction, and UAS-Sip1 transgenic lines give
similar  phenotypes  (data  not  shown),  indicating  that  these
phenotypes are a consequence of Sip1 overexpression.

We  next  examined  the  effects  of  co-expression  of Sip1 (using
the EP2037 line) and specific Moe transgenes that encode either
wild type, activated or inactivated forms of the protein (Speck et
al., 2003). Expression of either wild-type Moe or the inactivated
allele  MoeT559A alone  had  no  dominant  phenotype  (Fig.  3B,D),
whereas expression of the constitutively activated MoeT559D allele
(Speck  et  al.,  2003)  produced  wings  that  had  a  wild-type  vein
pattern, but were curved up slightly at the edge, suggesting that the
dorsal surface of the wing is reduced in size (Fig. 3C). Co-expression
of  wild-type  Moe with  Sip1 moderately  enhanced  the  venation
defects observed with Sip1 alone (Fig. 3F, arrow and arrowhead),
and produced wings that were curved upward, as observed with the
activated  MoeT559D allele,  suggesting  that  Moe and  Sip1 are
synergistic in their functions. Consistent with this hypothesis, co-
expression of activated Moe (MoeT559D) and Sip1 produced wings
that were dramatically smaller in size and displayed large blisters
(Fig. 3G, arrow) and cuticular vesicles (Fig. 3G, arrowhead). This

effect on wing development was more severe than that observed
with expression of either transgene alone. By contrast, co-expression
of inactivated Moe (MoeT559A) and Sip1 resulted in adult wings that
were  wild  type  in  appearance  (Fig.  3H),  suggesting  that  the
functional  interaction  between  Sip1  and  Moesin  involves
phosphorylation at this conserved threonine residue.

We have shown previously that Moesin is required to maintain
epithelial integrity, and that it does so by negatively regulating the
RhoA  signaling  pathway  (Speck  et  al.,  2003).  To  further  test
interactions  between  Sip1 and  Moe,  we  asked  whether  Sip1 was
also involved in RhoA regulation by examining the effect of the
genetic dosage of Rho1 (the Drosophila RhoA orthologue) on Sip1
phenotypes. Sip106373 homozygotes did not survive past hatching.
However, in Rho1720 heterozygotes, the percentage of Sip1 mutants
surviving  to  adulthood  increased  to  an  average  of  27.8±5%,
suggesting that Rho1 and Sip1 function antagonistically.

Loss of Sip1 leads to defects of the adherens junctions
and actin cytoskeleton
We  next  examined  the  effects  of  Sip1 mutations  in  developing
epithelia.  As  Sip106373 is  late  embryonic  lethal,  we  used  somatic
mosaic analysis to remove Sip1 function in small groups of cells

apparent affect on adult wing morphology. (C) Expression of an activated Moe transgene (UAS- MoeT559D) produces wings that are curved upwards at the edges
(not apparent in this preparation) but otherwise normal. (D) Expression of an inactive Moe transgene (UAS-MoeT559A) results in wings that look completely like the
wild type. (E) Expression of the Sip1 EP line, EP2037, under the MS1096 Gal4 driver produces wings with blisters that are apparent along vein L3 (arrowhead) as
well as slight venation defects (arrow). (F) Co-expression of both Moe and Sip1 (EP2037) under control of the MS1096 GAL4 driver results in wings that have vein
defects and are curved upwards at the edges. There is extra vein material on vein L3 (arrowhead) and vein L4 does not reach the wing margin (arrow). (G) Co-
expression of activated MoeT559D and Sip1 produces wings that are smaller in size and are very warped, with large blister-like (arrow) and vesicle-like structures

within  developing  tissues,  such  as  the  imaginal  discs  and  the
follicular  epithelium  (Xu  and  Rubin,  1993).  No  changes  were
observed  in  the  relative  amount  or  localization  of  Moesin  (or
phosphorylated Moesin), or in the polarity markers E-cadherin and
F-actin  in  imaginal  epithelial  cells  (data  not  shown).  Thus,  Sip1
does not appear to be required for Moesin function in these larval
tissues, or perhaps has redundant functions with another, unknown,
protein.

In contrast to the imaginal disc epithelium, loss of Sip1 function
in the follicle cells that surround the developing oocyte and associated

nurse cells had severe phenotypes (Fig. 4). Initially, we examined F-
actin as a marker for overall cytoskeletal morphology. In wild-type
cells, apical F-actin encircled the apical domain in a characteristic
honeycomb-like pattern in association with adherens junctions (Fig.
4C). By contrast, in stage 13 follicle cells, F-actin within Sip1 mutant
clones was dramatically redistributed into long fibre-like structures
(Fig.  4C,  arrow)  and  E-cadherin  staining,  a  marker  for  adherens
junctions,  was  strongly  reduced  (Fig.  4F).  We  also  noted  that  E-
cadherin was depleted on the edges of wild-type cells that border the
clonal region (Fig. 4F, arrow) suggesting that the adherens junctions

are also disrupted in borders between wild-type and Sip1 follicle cells.
By contrast, the localization of the septate junction markers coracle
and Fasciclin III are not altered in Sip1 mutant clones (Fig. 4I,J).

Interactions between Sip1, Moesin and Slik
To better understand the functional relationships between Moesin,
Slik and Sip1, we examined the effects of mutations in each on the
other components in the follicular epithelium. Slik has been shown
to regulate the activity of Moesin by controlling phosphorylation of
a threonine residue close to the C-terminus (Hipfner et al., 2004). In
Sip1 mutant  follicle  cell  clones,  anti-Slik  staining  was  strongly
depleted and appeared to be mislocalized relative to adjacent wild-
type  cells  (Fig.  4M).  There  was  less  cortical  Slik  staining  and  no
apparent  cytoplasmic  Slik  staining  in  Sip1 mutant  cells  (Fig.  4M,
arrows). These changes in Slik localization were observed from stage
9-10 onward. Consistent with the mislocalization of Slik, activated
Moesin staining was absent within Sip1 mutant clones in stage 13
follicle cells (Fig. 5C), as assayed using a phospho-specific antibody
for Moesin (Karagiosis and Ready, 2004). By contrast, a pan-Moesin
antibody did not show an obvious change in the abundance of Moesin
in Sip1 mutant cells (Fig. 5F), indicating that Moesin expression and
stability are not significantly affected by loss of Sip1. These results
suggest that Sip1 is required for phosphorylation of Moesin in follicle
cells via its effects on Slik localization or stability.

Previous studies have shown that loss of ezrin has a dramatic
effect  on  EBP50/NHERF1  localization  in  mammalian  intestinal
epithelia  (Saotome  et  al.,  2004).  Consistent  with  the  notion  that
Sip1 is functionally homologous to EBP50/NHERF1, we found that
loss  of  Moesin  function  had  a  dramatic  effect  on  the  subcellular
localization and overall abundance of Sip1within the mutant cells
(Fig. 6C). Additionally, loss of Slik resulted in increased staining

for  Sip1,  which  appeared  to  be  present  not  only  on  the  plasma
membrane, but also within the cytoplasm of follicle cells (Fig. 6F).
The change in the abundance of Sip1 in Slik mutant cells was first
apparent at stage 8-9.

The  genetic 

interactions  described  suggest  a  complex,
interdependent  relationship  between  Moesin,  Sip1  and  Slik.  To
examine this further, we used co-immunoprecipitation experiments
to  ask  whether  these  proteins  form  complexes  in  Drosophila
cultured cells and epithelial tissues. To determine whether Moesin
and Sip1 were in a complex, as suggested by the two-hybrid data,
we  expressed  a  MYC-tagged  Sip1 transgene  in  pupal  imaginal
epithelia  and  found  that  it  specifically  co-immunoprecipitated
endogenously  expressed  Moesin  (Fig.  7A).  To  explore  these
interactions further, we expressed epitope-tagged Sip1 in cultured
S2 cells and found that it specifically pulled down both Moesin and
Slik kinase (Fig. 7B), suggesting that both proteins form a complex
with Sip1. Taken together with the genetic experiments, these results
suggest  that  Sip1  promoted  Moesin  function  by  affecting  its
interactions with the Slik kinase. Although further experiments will
be  required  to  define  the  precise  relationships  between  these
proteins, a possible model for how Sip1 regulates Moesin function
is presented in Fig. 8.

Discussion
Previous studies of EBP50/NHERF1 suggested a key role for this
protein  in  regulating  transmembrane  protein  localization  and
retention  at  the  plasma  membrane.  In  this  study,  we  have  taken
advantage of the genetic tools available in Drosophila to identify
and  characterize  some  of 
the
EBP50/NHERF1  orthologue  Sip1.  Searches  of  the  Drosophila
genome  suggest  that  Sip1  is  the  single  fly  orthologue  of

in  vivo  functions  of

of co-immunoprecipitated endogenous Moesin protein. The control lane

MYC antibody. Moesin co-immunoprecipitated with Sip1, suggesting that
these proteins form a complex in vivo. (B) An UAS HA-tagged Sip1 transgene

Expressed Sip1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody.
Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted to specifically detect both

precipitating Moesin and Slik are observed in the Sip1 immunoprecipitates but
not in the mock immunoprecipitate (no HA antibody control) lane.

EBP50/NHERF1, whereas in mammals there are two paralogues,
EBP50/NHERF1 and NHERF2. Thus studies in Drosophila should
have  fewer  potential  genetic  redundancy  problems  than  those  in
mammalian systems.

It is interesting to note that the single PDZ domain in Sip1 has
higher similarity to human EBP50/NHERF1 PDZ2 (81%) than to
PDZ1  (60%).  Although  differential  ligand  specificity  has  been
observed  between  PDZ1  and  PDZ2  in  EBP50/NHERF1,  several
ligands, including CFTR, Gqa, and SRY-1, appear to bind to both
domains (Weinman et al., 2006). Thus, although having a single
PDZ  domain  might  decrease  the  range  of  ligands  to  which  Sip1
can bind, Sip1 should nonetheless be able to interact with a range
of transmembrane and membrane-associated ligands. At this time,
we have not yet identified other Sip1 ligands, but it is possible that
several PDZ domains in mammals have been adapted to deal with
the greater complexity of the mammalian proteome compared with
that in flies and worms. However, a clear functional difference is
that Sip1 should not be able to act as a scaffold to bring together
two ligands, as has been proposed in a few instances for the NHERF
proteins (Weinman et al., 2006). Such a function could be provided
by other Sip1 binding partners, or might simply not be needed in
the fly. Further studies of Sip1 binding partners should address these
intriguing questions.

Fig. 8. Possible model for Sip1 in Slik-dependent activation of Moesin.
Inactive, folded Moesin in the cell cortex might associate with PIP2 in the
plasma membrane, inducing a conformational change that results in partial
unfolding of Moesin. This event, or other modifications such as
phosphorylation of residues in the FERM domain (Krieg and Hunter, 1992),
allow Moesin, Sip1 and Slik to form a complex that results in phosphorylation
of the C-terminal Thr residue and full activation of Moesin.

Collectively, our data suggest a novel activity for Sip1, namely
that it facilitates Slik-dependent phosphorylation and activation of
Moesin.  Both  genetic  and  biochemical  evidence  support  this
conclusion. Clonal analysis indicates that Sip1 is required for normal
subcellular localization and abundance of Slik (Fig. 4M) and normal
phosphorylation  of  Moesin  (Fig.  5C)  without  affecting  overall
Moesin  abundance  (Fig.  5F).  In  addition,  Sip1  appears  to  be
upregulated in slik mutant cells (Fig. 6F), suggesting that Slik and
Sip1 have an interdependent relationship. Co-immunoprecipitation
experiments in pupae and in cultured S2 cells indicated that Sip1
forms complexes with both Slik and Moesin, although at the moment
it  is  unclear  whether  all  three  proteins  are  present  in  a  single
complex. Taken together, these results suggest that Sip1 functions
to bring Slik and Moesin in close proximity, possibly by acting as
a  scaffold  that  links  these  proteins  together  and  leading  to
phosphorylation of Moesin (Fig. 8). Although our yeast two-hybrid
data indicate that Moesin and Sip1 interact directly, we have not
distinguished  between  the  possibilities  of  direct  versus  indirect
interactions with Slik. It is interesting to note that EBP50/NHERF1
has been shown to form a complex with Ste20-related kinase SLK,
the mammalian orthologue of Slik, via the adapter protein PDZK1
(Gisler et al., 2003; Lalonde and Bretscher, 2009).

One potential problem with this model is that previous work has
suggested that EBP50/NHERF1 is unable to bind the folded, inactive
form of ezrin (Finnerty et al., 2004; Reczek and Bretscher, 1998;
Morales et al., 2007), raising the question of how Sip1 can facilitate
activation of Moesin if it cannot bind the inactive, folded form. A
possible  answer  to  this  question  comes  from  recent  observations
that ERMs are regulated by several factors that might operate in a
step-wise  fashion.  Specifically,  previous  studies  have  suggested

either a two-step mechanism involving binding of PIP2 to the FERM
domain, followed by phosphorylation of the conserved C-terminal
Thr (Fievet et al., 2004; Yonemura et al., 2002), or a ‘rheostat’-like
mechanism that allows for several intermediate states of unfolding
and activation (Li et al., 2007). Proposed components of the rheostat
mechanism  include  binding  of  the  FERM  domain  to  PIP2  and
phosphorylation, not only of the C-terminal Thr, but of other residues
as well. Thus, we propose that interaction of a Sip1-Slik complex
with Moesin probably requires previous partial unfolding of Moesin
through one or more of these mechanisms (Fig. 8).

Although  a  role  for  EBP50/NHERF1  in  promoting  ERM
phosphorylation has not been proposed previously, several aspects
of our findings and conclusions are consistent with previous studies
in mammalian systems. Sip1 binds Moesin in both two-hybrid and
co-immunoprecipitation  analyses,  as  has  been  observed  for
EBP50/NHERF1 in mammalian cells (Finnerty et al., 2004; Morales
et al., 2004; Morales et al., 2007; Nguyen et al., 2001; Reczek and
Bretscher, 1998). Consistent with this result, loss of Moesin and/or
ezrin results in mislocalization of Sip1/EBP50 in both the fly and
in  the  mouse  (Fig.  6C)  (Saotome  et  al.,  2004).  In Ebp50 mutant
mice, there is a decrease in phosphorylated ERM proteins in the
kidney  and  intestinal  epithelia  (Morales  et  al.,  2004).  EBP50  is
suggested to be necessary to stabilize active phosphorylated ERM
proteins  at  the  apical  membrane  (Morales  et  al.,  2004),  but  this
observation  would  also  be  consistent  with  the  model  whereby
EBP50/Sip1 promotes ERM phosphorylation. Assuming that this
is true, what remains unclear is the identity of the responsible kinase
in  mammalian  cells.  Although  Rho  kinase  has  been  proposed  to
phosphorylate this residue (Matsui et al., 1998; Shaw et al., 1998;
Tran Quang et al., 2000), subsequent studies have raised questions
about  this  proposal  (Hipfner  et  al.,  2004;  Matsui  et  al.,  1999;
Takahashi et al., 1997), and no alternative kinase has been identified.
The  overall  conservation  of  ERMs  and  Sip1/EBP50/NHERF1
between flies and humans strongly suggests that there is an as yet
unidentified  sterile  20  kinase  family  member  involved  in  ERM
phosphorylation in mammalian cells.

The requirement of Sip1 for promotion of Moesin activity is also
supported by the observation that reduction of the Rho1 gene dosage
partially  suppresses  the  lethality  of  the  Sip1 mutant  animal.
Previously, we have shown that Moesin regulates epithelial integrity
via downregulation of Rho1 signaling (Speck et al., 2003). Similarly,
Slik  hypomorphic  defects  are  rescued  by  a  reduced  Rho1  gene
dosage (Hipfner et al., 2004), suggesting that Slik regulates Rho1
signaling  via  phosphorylation  and  activation  of  Moesin.  Taken
together, these results suggest that Sip1, Slik and Moesin function
synergistically to negatively regulate Rho1 pathway activity, and
emphasize the importance of the functional interaction between Sip1
and Moesin for proper epithelial morphogenesis.

Support for this model comes from the genetic interaction we
observed between Sip1 and Moe. Co-expression of an activated Moe
transgene strongly enhances the effects of Sip1 expression (Fig. 3G),
whereas expression of the inactive, non-phosphorylatable MoeT559A
allele suppresses Sip1 hypermorphic phenotypes (Fig. 3H). These
results  are  consistent  with  Sip1 and  Moe acting  synergistically.
Furthermore, the observation that the non-phosphorylatable T559A
allele suppresses Sip1 expression phenotypes could suggest that co-
expression  of  this  form  inactivates  Sip1,  possibly  through  direct
interaction,  although  we  were  unable  to  demonstrate  increased
complex  formation  in  co-immunoprecipitation  experiments  (data
not shown). In addition, the strong synergistic genetic interactions
between Sip1 and the phosphomimetic form of MoeT559D suggests

that Sip1 either interacts specifically with phosphorylated Moesin,
or promotes Moesin phosphorylation (Fig. 3G).

It is interesting to note that either reduced or increased levels of
Sip1 expression have dramatic effects on epithelial integrity. Loss
of  function  Sip1  clones  in  follicle  cell  epithelia  result  in
reorganization  of  the  actin  cytoskeleton  and  loss  of  E-cadherin
localization, strongly suggesting that adherens junction integrity is
affected (Fig. 4C,F). In addition, ectopic expression of Sip1 in the
adult wing leads to the formation of vesicles (Fig. 3E), which is
indicative of defects in cell adhesion (Prout et al., 1997; Walsh and
Brown,  1998).  In  mammalian  cells  it  has  also  been  shown  that
reduced ezrin levels result in the loss of cell adhesion complexes
(Hiscox and Jiang, 1999; Takeuchi et al., 1994). This suggests that
the  production  of  Sip1  protein  must  be  tightly  regulated  within
epithelial  cells  to  regulate  epithelial  integrity,  probably  through
regulation of the interaction between Slik and Moesin.

We consistently observed strong effects of loss of Sip1 function
within the follicle cell epithelia, but not in the columnar epithelial
cells  of  third  imaginal  wing  discs,  indicating  a  differential  cell
requirement for Sip1 activity. This might be linked to changes in
cell  morphology,  because  follicle  epithelial  cells  are  initially
cuboidal, but undergo dramatic changes in cell shape beginning at
stage 9. At this point, the follicle cells located over the growing
oocyte  migrate  posteriorly  and  become  columnar,  whereas  the
follicle  cells  over  the  nurse  cells  become  squamous  (Horne-
Badovinac and Bilder, 2005). The majority of the defects that we
observed in the follicle cells, whether located over the oocyte or
nurse cells, occur at or following, stage 9. These changes in cell
shape  would  require  alteration  in  both  cell  adhesion  and  the
organization of the actin cytoskeleton, which contribute to the force
required  for  the  migration  (Horne-Badovinac  and  Bilder,  2005).
Thus, these cells might be particularly susceptible to perturbations
that affect regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics or linkage between
the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton. Another, not mutually
exclusive, factor is that follicle cells are no longer mitotically active
at  the  stages  we  observed  (Horne-Badovinac  and  Bilder,  2005),
whereas the wing imaginal discs undergo mitosis throughout their
development  (Milan  et  al.,  1996).  Perhaps  there  are  independent
mechanisms for regulating the interactions with Slik and Moesin
in  actively  dividing  cells.  A  third  possibility  is  that  an  unknown
protein acts redundantly to Sip1 to regulate the activity of Slik and
Moesin in the third instar imaginal disc tissue.

A crucial question that remains to be answered regarding Sip1,
Moesin  and  Slik  is  how  their  activities  are  co-regulated  in
developing  epithelia.  Our  previous  work  (Hughes  and  Fehon,
2006)  clearly  suggests  that  regulation  of  Slik  kinase  activity  is
important in developing epithelial cells. The results presented here
indicate that the effect of Slik on Moesin activity, and therefore on
epithelial  integrity,  could  be  regulated  by  Sip1.  Furthermore,
because our previous studies have shown that Slik also regulates
the  tumour  suppressor  Merlin  (Hughes  and  Fehon,  2006),  these
results raise the possibility that Sip1 could control proliferation in
epithelial tissues. As we can now study the EBP50/NHERF family
in Drosophila, it should be possible to identify other gene pathways
that are involved in the activity and localization of Sip1.

Materials and Methods
Drosophila stocks
The  UAS-overexpression  line  EP2037  was  obtained  from  S.  Eaton  (EMBL).  The
UAS-Sip1  transgene  was  created  by  subcloning  a  Sip1 PCR  fragment  (5⬘ primer,
CGG GAT CCT CCA CGC CCA CTT CCC CGA AG; 3⬘ primer, CGC TGC AGT
CAG AGC TTC TGA ATG ATG TCG) from the full-length cDNA LD07731 into a

pBS II SK+ N-terminal MYC tag shuttle vector (LaJeunesse et al., 1998). This was
subsequently subcloned into a pUAST transformation vector (Brand and Perrimon,
1993). Germline transformation was carried out as described (Rubin and Spradling,
1982) and four independent lines were generated. All other stocks and mutant alleles
were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center.

Co-immunoprecipitation assays
A mild lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM
EGTA, 10 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche)
was used for immunoprecipitation. The protein complex associated with MYC epitope-
tagged  Sip1  protein  was  immunoprecipitated  using  an  anti-MYC  antibody
[Developmental  Studies  Hybridoma  Bank  (DHSB)]  linked  to  protein-G  beads
(McCartney and Fehon, 1996) or mouse anti-HA (Sigma) linked to protein-A beads.
For the anti-MYC experiment, the control immunoprecipitation uses protein-G beads
alone  incubated  with  the  respective  Drosophila lysates,  and  the  control
immunoprecipitation  with  anti-HA  Sip1  was  performed  on  transiently  transfected
Schneider 2 cells, using protein-A beads alone (without anti-HA). Schneider 2 cells
were  transiently  transfected  using  DDAB  (Han,  1996).  Lysates  for  anti-HASip1
immunoprecipitates  were  crosslinked  with  1%  formaldehyde  upon 
lysis
(Niranjanakumari et al., 2002). Immunoprecipitates were incubated at 4°C for 3 hours,
washed extensively in mild lysis buffer, spun down and boiled in 2⫻ SDS sample
buffer, run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot
analysis using appropriate primary antibodies (described below) were visualized using
an infrared imaging system (Odyssey; LI-COR).

Sip1 antibody production
Polyclonal antibodies recognizing Sip1 were raised in guinea pigs against amino acids
1-296.  Sip1  sequences  were  generated  by  polymerase  chain  reaction  using  the
following  primers:  5⬘-CGGGATCCATGTCCACGCCCACTTCCCCG-3⬘ and  5⬘-
CGGGATCCATGTCCACGCCCACTTCCCCG-3⬘. This product was excised with
BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pGEX2. The cloned
Sip1 coding sequence was confirmed by sequencing.

Induction of somatic mosaic clones and immunolocalization
Larvae or female adults of the genotype 42DFRT P(pM)/42DFRT Sip06373; hsFLP/+
or  42DFRT  Ubi-GFPnls/42DFRT  Sip06373;  hsFLP/+ or  42DFRT/42DFRT  Sip06373;
hsFLP/+ were heat shocked (45 minutes at 37°C, 45 minutes at 25°C, 45 minutes
at 37°C) at 36-48 hours after egg laying for the imaginal discs or at 2 days of age
for adult females. Larval wing discs were dissected and prepared as described (Hughes
and Fehon, 2006). Ovaries from adult females that were 2-4 days post heat shock
were dissected in S2 medium and fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Hughes and Fehon,
2006)  or  10%  trichloroacetic  acid  (TCA;  specifically  for  the  phospho-Moesin
staining (Hayashi et al., 1999) or for F-actin (Bateman et al., 2001). Embryos were
fixed  and  prepared  for  immunofluorescence  as  described  previously  (Hughes  and
Krause, 2001). Antibodies were used as follows: rabbit anti-Moesin D44 at 1:20,000
(D. Kiehart, Duke University, Durham, NC), rabbit anti-phospho-Moesin at 1:10,000
(Karagiosis and Ready, 2004), rabbit anti-phospho ERM (Cell Signaling) (Chorna-
Ornan et al., 2005), guinea pig anti-Sip1 at 1:1000 (tissues) or 1:10,000 (immunoblot),
guinea pig anti-merlin at 1:10,000 (McCartney and Fehon, 1996), mouse anti-Coracle
at 1:500 (Fehon et al., 1994), mouse anti-MYC 9B11 at 1:2000 (Cell Signaling), rat
anti-E-cadherin at 1:200 [DCAD2 (Oda et al., 1997)], mouse anti-fasciclin III at 1:1000
(7G10; DHSB) and mouse anti-b-tubulin at 1:5000 (immunoblot; E7, DHSB), mouse
anti-MYC  (immunoblot;  1:10,000,  Cell  Signaling)  and  rat  anti-HA  at  1:500
(immunoblot;  Roche).  GFP  was  visualized  directly.  Immunostained  tissues  were
mounted in ProLong (Invitrogen) and imaged using either a LSM 410 or LSM 510
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) using a plan-Apo ⫻63, NA 1.4 lens.
Figures were compiled in Photoshop 7.0.1 (Adobe).

Analysis of adult wing phenotypes
Flies of the appropriate genotypes were raised at 25°C. Adult wings were prepared
as described (LaJeunesse et al., 2001). Images of wings were taken using a Spot RT
camera mounted on an Axioplan2ie microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) using a
Fluar ⫻5, NA 0.25 lens and processed in Photoshop 7.0.1 (Adobe).
