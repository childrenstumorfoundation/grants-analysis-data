Abstract
Purpose The  present  investigation  was  undertaken  to
characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  and  oral  bioavailability
of Kendine 91 in mice and to compare it with other HDAC
(histone deacetylases) inhibitors.
Methods After  administration  of  a  single  intravenous
dose (10 mg/kg) or a single oral dose (50 mg/kg) blood and
tissues samples were collected and analysed by HPLC/MS/
MS.
Results Elimination  half-life  was  higher  than  that  of
SAHA  (5.87  vs.  0.38 h  after  intravenous  (IV)  administra-
tion  and  10.29  versus  0.75 h  after  oral  administration).
Absolute  oral  bioavailability  was  found  to  be  18%.  Total
body  clearance  (7.72 l/h/kg)  was  greater  than  the  hepatic
blood Xow of 5.4 l/h/kg in mice and larger than glomerular
Wltration rate in mice (0.84 l/h/kg). Tissue levels and distri-
bution  volume  indicate  a  high  capacity  of  Kendine  91  to
distribute into tissues.
Conclusions This  preliminary  pharmacokinetic  evalua-
tion prompts us to believe that it is worth pursuing further
development of Kendine 91 as an anticancer drug.

Introduction

The  transcriptional  activity  of  certain  genes  is  modulated
by  the  acetylation  state  of  core  histones.  Histone  acetyl-
transferases  (HAT)  can  stimulate  gene  transcription  by
histone  acetylation,  inducing  an  open  chromatin  state.
Changes on the chromatin structure promote the access of
transcription  factors  to  the  promoter  regions  and  result  in
the activation of gene transcription [1, 2]. Histone deacety-
lases (HDACs) are catalytic enzymes that control the struc-
ture  of  chromatin  via  removal  of  the  acetyl  inserted  in
lysine  residues  of  histones  [3]  by  HAT.  The  most  exten-
sively studied post-translational modiWcation of histones is
the acetylation of lysine.

Preclinical  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  use  of
HDAC  inhibitors  (HDACis)  induces  cytodiVerentiation,
cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in transformed cells [4] and
shows a promising antitumuor activity both in vivo and in
vitro,  suggesting  that  the  HDACis  may  be  potentially
important novel anticancer therapeutics [5].

Among the wide variety of HDAC inhibitors synthesized
to date, some of them are already in clinical trials and one
of them, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA or Vori-
nostat) [6], has recently been commercialized. SAHA is a
hydroxamic acid–based HDACi that induces diVerentiation
and  apoptosis  in  diVerent cell  lines [6, 7]. SAHA inhibits
HDAC,  which  results  in  the  accumulation  of  acetylated
histones  of  type  H2a,  H2b,  H3,  and  H4  through  a  direct
interaction  with  the  catalytic  site  of  the  enzyme  [6].
Unfortunately SAHA has low solubility and low permeabil-
ity,  being  classiWed  as  class  IV  by  the  biopharmaceutics

classiWcation system (BCS), which implies that SAHA may
not be well absorbed and may not reach the target receptor [8].
Out  of  this  study  we  have  designed  and  synthesized  a
new family of HDAC inhibitors [9], Kendine 91 being the
most  promising  candidate.  Its  chemical  structure  is  pre-
sented in Fig. 1. Among the members of this new family of
HDACis, Kendine 91 shows the most promising activity in
the treatment of solid tumours and haematologic malignan-
cies. Kendine 91 acts as a potent and speciWc histone deace-
tylase  inhibitor  in  HCT  116  and  MOLT  4  human  cancer
cell lines [9].

To  appropriately  design  future  clinical  trials  that  will
achieve plasma concentrations of Kendine 91 suYcient to
induce  antitumuor  activity,  preclinical  pharmacokinetic
studies  are  needed.  The  present  investigation  was  under-
taken  to  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  and  oral  bio-
availability of Kendine 91 in mice.

Materials and methods

Chemicals and reagents

Kendine  91  was  synthesized  in  the  Organic  Chemistry
group of the University of the Basque Country (San Sebas-
tian, Spain) [9]. Simvastatin, used as internal standard (IS)
was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Metha-
nol  (gradient  HPLC  grade)  was  obtained  from  Scharlau
(Barcelona,  Spain).  Propylene  glycol,  formic  acid,  ortho-
phosphoric  acid  85%,  sodium  di-hydrogen  phosphate  1-
hydrate  and  tert-butyl  methyl  ether  (MTBE)  were  pur-
chased  from  Panreac  Química  (Barcelona,  Spain).  Ultra-
pure  water  was  obtained  from  a  Milli-Q®  Plus  apparatus
(Millipore).  Other  chemicals  were  all  of  analytical  grade.
Plasma was obtained from Centro Vasco de Transfusiones
(Galdakao, Spain). Female balb/c nude mice weighing 18–
22 g  (5 weeks  of  age)  were  purchased  from  the  Harlam
Interfauna Ibérica S.L (Barcelona, Spain).

Drug administration and sample collection

Animals were handled in accordance with the Principles
of  Laboratory  Animal  Care  (http://www.history.nih.gov/
laws).  Mice  were  quarantined  for  approximately  1 week

prior to the study. They were housed under standard condi-
tions and had ad libitum access to water and standard labo-
ratory rodent diet. Kendine 91 was dissolved in a mixture
of propylene glycol, ethanol and water. Mice were grouped
Wve per time point and were administered a single intrave-
nous dose (10 mg/kg) through tail vein. At predeWned times
(pre-dose, 0.08, 0.25, 0.5,1, 2, 3, 6, 8 and 12 h) mice were
killed by CO2 overdose. For oral administration (50 mg/kg
dose),  animals  were  maintained  in  fasted  conditions 12 h
before dose administration. Four hours after administration,
animals were fed with standard laboratory rodent diet. After
0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h, mice were
killed  by  CO2  overdose.  At  pre-dose  time,  samples  were
also collected. In both cases (intravenous and oral adminis-
tration) blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture
and tissues of interest (liver, heart, lung, kidney and mus-
cle)  were  extracted.  Blood  samples  were  centrifuged  for
5 min at 8,000 rpm at 4°C and the plasma and tissues were
kept frozen at ¡80°C until analysis.

Analytical method for determining Kendine 91 in plasma 
and tissues

Kendine 91 level in plasma and tissues was determined by
HPLC/MS-MS  according  to  a  method  described  and  vali-
dated previously [10]. BrieXy, separation was performed on
a  C8  column,  with  a  mobile  phase  consisting  of  methanol
and aqueous 10 mM formic acid (73:27 v/v). Both analyte
and  internal  standard  (simvastatin)  were  determined  using
electrospray ionization and the MS data acquisition was via
MRM  in  positive  scanning  mode.  QuantiWcation  was  per-
formed using the transitions m/z 444 ! 169 and 441 ! 325
for Kendine 91 and simvastatin, respectively. Liquid–liquid
extraction  was  employed  for  the  sample  preparation  with
tert-butyl  methyl  ether.  Tissue  samples  were  accurately
weighed and homogenized in phosphate buVer solution pH
7.4.  Tissue  homogenates  were  processed  as  were  plasma
samples, and analysed by HPLC. Recovery of Kendine 91 in
tissue samples relative to plasma samples was obtained by
comparing the chromatographic response of Kendine 91 in
the  tissue  samples  with  the  chromatographic  response  of
Kendine  91  in  the  plasma  samples.  This  factor  was  later
used to calculate the Kendine 91 concentration in unknown
tissue samples from calibration curves obtained with plasma
samples.  Liver,  heart,  lung,  kidney  and  muscle  recoveries
were 0.7, 0.67, 0.74, 0.77 and 0.40, respectively. The analyt-
ical  method  was  validated  with  respect  to  linearity,  accu-
racy, precision, recovery and stability.

Pharmacokinetic analysis

Plasma  concentration  data  of  Kendine  91  were  obtained
from mice and were pooled to provide mean concentration

data.  The  same  was  carried  out  for  tissue  concentrations.
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  calculated  by  a  non-
compartment  method  using  WinNonlin  4.1  (Professional
Version 4.1;  Pharsight  Corp;  Mountain  View, CA, USA).
Maximum  plasma  concentration  (Cmax)  and  the  time  to
reach  Cmax  (Tmax)  were  estimated  directly  from  the
observed concentration versus time proWles. The area under
the curve of plasma concentration versus time curve up to
the last quantiWable time point, AUC0–t was obtained by the
linear trapezoidal method. The AUC0–t was extrapolated to
inWnity  (AUC0–1)  by  adding  the  quotient  Clast/Kel,  where
Clast represents the last measured concentration and Kel rep-
resents the apparent terminal rate constant.  Kel was calcu-
lated  by  the  linear  regression  of  the  log-transformed
concentrations of the drug in the terminal phase. The half-
life  of  the  terminal  elimination  phase  was  obtained  using
the  relationship  t1/2 = 0.693/Kel.  Systemic  clearance  was
calculated by the relationship CL = D £ F/AUC0–1, where
D is the dose of the compound and F the fraction of dose
absorbed.
The apparent volume of distribution was obtained from
the equation Vdz = D £ F/(AUC0–1 £ Kel). For intravenous
administration,  the  volume  of  distribution  at  the  steady-state
(Vss)  was  calculated  with  the  equation  Vss = MRT £ Cl.
Mean residence time (MRT) was determined by division of
AUMC  (area  under  the  Wrst  moment  curve)  by  AUC0–1.
Absolute oral bioavailability (F) was calculated from plasma
data  using  the  relationship  F = [doseIV £ AUC0–1,oral/
dose oral £ AUC0–1,IV] £ 100. From tissue levels, the factor
Fr  was  calculated  using  the  relationship  Fr = [doseIV £
AUC0–t,oral/dose oral £ AUC0–t, IV].

Results

Intravenous administration

The plasma concentration-time proWle of Kendine 91 after
intravenous administration is illustrated in Fig. 2.  Follow-
ing  a  10 mg/kg  IV  dose,  plasma  concentration  reached
3,715 ng/ml  at  5 min  and  then  declined  triexponentially
with time. The compound was detectable in plasma for up
to  12 h.  Data  were  analysed  according  to  a  noncompart-
mental analysis using WinNonlin and the relevant pharma-
cokinetic  parameters  were  computed  (Table 1).  The
elimination half-life was found to be 5.87 h. The mean total
body clearance was 7.72 l/h/kg and the volume of distribu-
tion  at  steady-state  was  6.3 l/kg.  Table 1  also  shows  the
pharmacokinetic parameters of other HDACis (SAHA, EX-2,
PXD 101, LBH-589 and SB 639) [8, 11]. In comparison
to other HDACis, Kendine 91 shows the highest elimina-
tion half-life. Plasma clearance of Kendine 91 was higher
than that of SAHA and EX-2, but lower than that of PXD

101,  LBH-589  and  SB639.  Kendine  91  mean  residence
time (MRT) was 0.82 h.

Figure 3 shows the tissue concentrations of Kendine 91
versus time in tissue homogenates after intravenous admin-
istration. Kendine 91 was present in liver, heart, lung, kid-
ney  and  muscle  until  8 h  after  administration.  Highest
values of AUC0–t of Kendine 91 were found in kidney and
heart.  The  tissue-speciWc  pharmacokinetic  parameters  are
presented in Table 2.

Oral administration

The  blood  concentration-time  proWle  of  Kendine  91  after
oral  administration  is  illustrated  in  Fig. 4.  Following  oral
administration at 50 mg/kg, mean maximal plasma concen-
tration of 4,234 ng/ml was observed. Concentrations were
detectable up to 24 h. A second maximum was observed in
the plasma level proWle, which could be due to enterohe-
patic  circulation  although  this  must  be  conWrmed  with
additional  studies.  Comparison  of  the  pharmacokinetic
parameters of Kendine 91 and the other HDACis [8, 11] are
presented  in  Table 1.  Elimination  half-life  increased  to
10.29 h compared to IV administration. The volume of dis-
tribution (Vdz) reached a value of 114.66 l/kg. The oral bio-
availability of Kendine 91 was estimated to be 18%, higher
than  bioavailability  of  the  other compounds  except  EX-2.
Kendine 91 mean residence time (MRT) was 3.46 h. Con-
centration-time  proWles  of  Kendine  91  after  oral  adminis-
tration in diVerent tissues are shown in Fig. 5. In all tissues,
concentrations were detected up to 24 h. The tissue-speciWc
pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in Table 2.

Discussion

Anticancer therapy needs to be improved with new mole-
cules that present higher eVectiveness and a more favour-
able  safety  proWle  than  the  commercialized  compounds.

Development  of  candidates  in  anticancer  therapy  needs  a
careful  exploration  and  understanding  of  the  pharmacoki-
netic disposition. This is important since the in vivo phar-
macokinetic  behaviour  and  PK-PD  correlation  can  act  as

surrogates  for  the  clinical  eVectiveness  of  the  compounds
[8]. In the process of  optimization of new candidates,  the
pharmacokinetic proWle has to be either equal to or better
than those attributed to existing drugs. Vorinostat (SAHA)

Fig. 4 Plasma concentration-time proWle of Kendine 91 after an oral
dose of 50 mg/Kg. (Error bars represent SD, n = 5)

is a HDAC inhibitor recently approved by the FDA. How-
ever, this compound presents a limited oral bioavailability
and  a  very  short  elimination  half-life  in  animals  [11]  and
humans [12]. It is desirable to Wnd another molecule in the
HDAC  inhibitor  class,  with  improved  physicochemical,
pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  properties  with
respect to SAHA.

The present work represents the Wrst report of the in vivo
pharmacokinetics  of  Kendine  91  in  an  animal  model,  the

mouse.  Intravenous  and  oral  administrations  were  per-
formed and the  oral  bioavailability  was  calculated. More-
over,  time  correlation  proWles  of  Kendine  91  levels  were
obtained in liver, heart, lung, kidney and muscle. The phar-
macokinetic  parameters  of  Kendine  91  were  compared  to
other  HDAC  inhibitors  [8,  11]  SAHA,  EX-2,  PXD  101,
LBH-589 and SB693. The pharmacokinetic comparison of
these compounds indicates that after IV and oral adminis-
tration,  elimination  half-life  of  Kendine  91  (5.87  and
10.29 h after IV and oral administration, respectively) was
much longer than that of SAHA (0.38 and 0.75 h after IV
and  oral  administration),  EX-2  (1.54  and  4.21 h  after  IV
and oral administration), PXD 101 (1.21 and 1.34 h after IV
and  oral  administration),  LBH-589  (1.37  and  2.90 h  after
IV  and  oral  administration)  and  SB693  (1.67  and  1.64 h
after  IV  and  oral  administration)  (Table 1).  MRT,  which
better describes the drug’s time course, was 0.82 and 3.46 h
for  intravenous  and  oral  administration,  respectively.  No
data  about  MRT  of  the  other  compounds  are  available.
Plasma  clearance  of  Kendine  91  after  IV  administration
was equivalent to that of SAHA (7.72 vs. 6.73 l/h/kg), but
lower than that of PXD 101 (11.6 l/h/kg), LBH-589 (18.3 l/
h/kg) and SB639 (15.8 l/h/kg). After oral administration, no
data of plasma clearance were reported for SAHA and the

other  inhibitors  [8,  11].  Nevertheless,  from  the  reported
plasma concentration-time proWle, it seems that it was not
possible to calculate due to its fast concentration decrease
in  plasma  levels.  However,  the  levels  of  Kendine  91
remained above the limit of quantiWcation up to 12 h post
doses after intravenous administration and up to 24 h post
doses  after  oral  administration.  Results  suggest  that  Ken-
dine  91  presents  improved  features  with  respect  to  other
inhibitors.

After oral administration, absorption of Kendine 91 from
mouse  gastrointestinal  tract  was  rapid;  Kendine  91  was
detected  in  plasma  from  the  Wrst  blood  sampling  point
(0.08 h). Absolute oral bioavailability was found to be 18%
at 50 mg/kg oral dose which was higher than that of SAHA
(8%)  [11],  PXD  101  (7%)  [11],  LBH-589  (5%)  [11]  and
SB639  (13%)  [8].  Although  these  values  correspond  to
mice,  oral  bioavailability  of  SAHA  in  human  at  doses  of
200 and 400 mg administered during the fasting state was
43% [13]. The modest oral bioavailability of Kendine 91 in
mice could be due to a poor absorption in the gastrointesti-
nal tract and/or small intestine or hepatic Wrst-pass metabo-
lism  when  administered  orally.  Kendine  91  presents  very
low water solubility and the dissolution process in the gas-
trointestinal  Xuid  could  limit  the  intestinal  absorption.
Phase I metabolism involves hydrolysis, reduction, and oxi-
dation of drugs. These reactions expose or introduce a func-
tional group (–OH, –NH2, –SH, or –COOH) to drugs and
usually results in an increase in the hydrophilicity of drugs
[14]. Phenyl groups are present in Kendine 91; thus theoret-
ically, one may expect that these groups would be modiWed
and  could  justify  a  Wrst-pass  eVect  in  the  intestine  and/or
the liver. Further studies are needed to know if the low bio-
availability  is  caused  by  poor  absorption  or  Wrst-pass
metabolism or both.

Examination of the concentration versus time curve for
Kendine  91  following  oral  administration  suggests  an
enterohepatic  circulation  since  several  maximums

plasma levels were detected. The enterohepatic circulation
of drugs may play an important role in the kinetic behav-
iour  [15,  16],  since  it  determines  a  greater  portion  of  the
AUC and an increase in half-life. However, enterohepatic
circulation must be conWrmed with additional studies, such
as the use of bile duct cannulated animals.

Kendine  91  total  body  clearance  (7.72 l/h/kg)  was
greater  than  the  hepatic  blood  Xow  of  5.4 l/h/kg  in  mice
[17]  and  larger  than  glomerular  Wltration  rate  in  mice
(0.84 l/h/kg)  [18].  This  suggests  that  clearance  could  be
attributed  to  a  combination  of  diVerent  elimination  path-
ways such as degradation/metabolism, glomerular Wltration
and/or others, like bile excretion. Tissue levels of Kendine
91 in liver and kidney support the idea of the contribution
of these organs to the drug elimination from the body.

After  IV  administration,  Kendine  91  tissue  levels
(Fig. 3) were still detected up to 8 h in liver, heart, lung and
muscle  and  up  to  12 h  in  kidney.  Tissue  levels  were
detected up to 24 h in all assayed tissues after oral adminis-
tration (Fig. 5). Fr values (Table 2) show the relative bio-
availability,  measured  in  terms  of  tissue  levels,  ranging
from 0.35 h in muscle to 0.49 h in heart. The higher half-
life  of  Kendine  91  after  oral  administration  that  could  be
due  to  enterohepatic  circulation,  could  justify  higher  bio-
availability  when  measured  from  tissue  levels  than  when
measured  from  plasma  levels.  The  highest  concentrations
of  Kendine  91  were  found  in  the  kidney,  which  suggests
that this new drug could be eliminated via this organ. The
second highest concentration was found in heart tissue, fol-
lowed by liver, lung and muscle. This pattern was found for
both  IV  and  oral  administration.  In  almost  all  tissues,  the
elimination  rate  paralleled  rather  closely  than  in  plasma,
which  indicates  that  unexpected  accumulation  should  not
occur in these tissues with repeated administration.

Distribution  volume  and  tissue  levels  of  Kendine  91
indicate extensive drug distribution in speciWc tissues. The
high lipid solubility of this new molecule could favour its

access to tissues. This  is  highly  convenient  for increasing
exposure of cancer and premalignant cells to optimal con-
centrations  of  drug,  suggesting  that  this  antitumour  com-
pound  could  be  useful  for  the  treatment  not  only  of
haematologic  malignancies  but  also  of  solid  tumours,  for
whose Kendine 91 presents biologic eVects.

Tissue  homogenates  have  been  extensively  used  to
determine drug concentration in tissues, although this does
not take into account the fact that tissues are made of dis-
tinct compartments: interstitial Xuid, cells and cell compart-
ments in which the drug is not necessarily distributed in a
homogeneous  fashion.  Moreover,  measurements  in  tissue
homogenates  do  not  give  any  information  on  whether  the
drug is actually available for activity [19]. In addition, it is
very diYcult to determine the concentration of a drug at the
receptor site. However, whole tissue concentrations can be
of  value  in  initial  studies  during  drug  development  to
overall distribution of the drug. This study is the Wrst phar-
macokinetic evaluation of this new molecule, and the infor-
mation provided by the tissue concentration-time proWle is
highly  useful  for  gaining  knowledge  on  the  capacity  of
Kendine 91 to access diVerent organs, and therefore to be
considered in a plausible treatment of solid tumours located
in those tissues.

In summary, the present study describes the pharmaco-
kinetics of Kendine 91, a novel HDAC inhibitor, in mice.
After IV and oral administration to mice, elimination half-
life  of  Kendine  91  was  higher  than  that  of  SAHA,  a
recently FDA approved HDAC inhibitor. After oral admin-
istration,  plasma  concentrations-time  proWle  indicates  a
possible  enterohepatic  circulation  although  this  must  be
conWrmed with additional studies. Tissue levels and distri-
bution  volume  indicate  high  capacity  to  distribute  into
tissues. Antitumour activity of Kendine 91 and this prelimi-
nary pharmacokinetic evaluation prompts us to believe that
it is worth pursuing further development of Kendine 91 as
an anticancer drug.
