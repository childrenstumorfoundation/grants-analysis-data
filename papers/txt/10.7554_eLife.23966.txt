Abstract The Hippo-YAP pathway is a central regulator of cell contact inhibition, proliferation
and death. There are conflicting reports regarding the role of Angiomotin (Amot) in regulating this
pathway. While some studies suggest a YAP-inhibitory function other studies indicate Amot is
required for YAP activity. Here, we describe an Amot-dependent complex comprised of Amot, YAP
and Merlin. The phosphorylation of Amot at Serine 176 shifts localization of this complex to the
plasma membrane, where it associates with the tight-junction proteins Pals1/PATJ and E-cadherin.
Conversely, hypophosphorylated Amot shifts localization of the complex to the nucleus, where it
facilitates the association of YAP and TEAD, induces transcriptional activation of YAP target genes
and promotes YAP-dependent cell proliferation. We propose that phosphorylation of AmotS176 is a
critical post-translational modification that suppresses YAP’s ability to promote cell proliferation
and tumorigenesis by altering the subcellular localization of an essential YAP co-factor.

Introduction
Angiomotin (Amot) was originally identified as an angiostatin-binding protein involved in the regula-
tion of endothelial cell polarization, migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis (Kikuno et al., 1999;
Levchenko et al., 2003; Troyanovsky et al., 2001). Amot is expressed as two isoforms generated
by alternative splicing, full-length Amot-p130 (referred to as Amot in this manuscript) and truncated
Amot-p80, which lacks the 409-amino acid N-terminus (Ernkvist et al., 2006). Amot, Angiomotin-
like 1 (AmotL1) and Angiomotin-like 2 (AmotL2) compose the Motin family of proteins, which share
an N-terminus with conserved glutamine-rich domains and PPxY motifs, and a C-terminus containing
conserved coiled-coil (CC) and PDZ-binding domains (Bratt et al., 2002; Nishimura et al., 2002;
Zheng et al., 2009). Although structurally similar, the functions of Motin family members appear to
be distinctive, as divergent spatiotemporal and expression levels have been described across human
and mouse tissues and cell lines for each of the family members (Moleirinho et al., 2014).

Functionally, Amot is required for endothelial cell migration, by binding to the Syx:Patj/Mupp1
polarity complex to localize RhoA activity to the leading edge of migratory cells (Ernkvist et al.,
2009). It has also been implicated in epithelial cell polarity, as an inhibitor of the GTPase-Activating
Protein (GAP) Rich1 and shown to compromise the integrity of tight junctions by promoting Rich1-
mediated hydrolysis of Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (Wells et al., 2006; Yi et al., 2011). Amot reg-
ulates collective migration of epithelial cells as part of a signaling axis composed of Merlin-Amot-
Rich1 and the Rac1 small GTPase (Das et al., 2015). At tight junctions (TJ), TJ-associated Merlin
inhibits Rac1 activation through the Amot-Rich1 axis, relocalizing Merlin to the cytoplasm during cell
migration and releasing Rac1 from a suppressed state (Das et al., 2015; Yi et al., 2011). Amot also

eLife digest Cells in animals and other multi-cellular organisms need to know when and where
they should grow and divide. Individual cells communicate with their surrounding environment and
each other via signaling pathways such as the Hippo-YAP pathway, which stimulates cells to grow
and therefore influences the size of organs. When the Hippo part of the pathway is active it causes a
protein known as YAP to move out of a compartment in the cell called the nucleus. Inside the
nucleus, YAP helps to activate genes that promote cell growth. If the Hippo pathway can no longer
respond to cues from the environment, YAP becomes over-active and can contribute to the
development of various cancers. Therefore researchers are trying to better understand how it is
regulated.

Many signals both from inside and outside the cell influence YAP activity. For example, some
signals block YAP from entering the nucleus, whereas others cause YAP to be broken down entirely.
Several studies have recently identified a signal protein called angiomotin as a regulator of YAP.
However, the studies provide conflicting reports as to whether angiomotin promotes or inhibits cell
growth.

Like many other proteins, angiomotin can be tagged with a small molecule called a phosphate

group that can alter its activity. Moleirinho, Hoxha et al. studied human cells containing versions of
angiomotin that mimic different forms of the protein with or without the phosphate. The
experiments indicate that when a phosphate is attached at a particular position (known as serine
176), angiomotin predominantly interacts with YAP and another protein called Merlin at the cell
surface. On the other hand, when angiomotin does not have a phosphate attached to it, all three
proteins can move into the nucleus, where YAP is able to activate genes and promote cell growth.

Overall, these findings indicate that adding a phosphate group to angiomotin can act as a switch

to regulate where in the cell it and YAP are found and thus, whether YAP is active. Future
experiments will investigate which enzymes add the phosphate group to serine 176, and when they
are able to do so.

directly binds to YAP, a central effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, via 106LPTY109/239PPxY242
motifs present in the N-terminal domain of Amot-p130 and WW domain present in YAP (Yi et al.,
2013, 2011; Zhao et al., 2011).

The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, originally characterized in Drosophila, is highly conserved in
mammals and regulates organ size, cell contact inhibition, proliferation, apoptosis and polarity
(Ramos and Camargo, 2012; Yi and Kissil, 2010; Yu et al., 2015). At the core of the mammalian
pathway, MST1/2 promote phosphorylation of WW45 (also known as Sav1), Lats1/2, and MOB1
(MOBKL1A/B). Once activated, Lats1/2 phosphorylates the primary downstream effector YAP, pro-
moting ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation by a SCFbeta-TRCP E3 ligase and sequestering
YAP from the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional co-activator (Hao et al., 2008;
Zhao et al., 2010b, 2007). Among the different transcription factors activated by YAP, the DNA-
binding TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors are thought to mediate a YAP-driven pro-prolifer-
ative gene expression program (Galli et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2010b, 2007).

YAP’s involvement in cancer has been demonstrated in several tissues, including liver, intestine,
heart, pancreas, and brain (Yu et al., 2015; Guerrant et al., 2016). Importantly, recent studies
revealed YAP plays a key role in developing resistance to RAF- and MEK-targeted therapies in lung
and colon cancer cells (Lin et al., 2015) and cancer relapse in KRAS-driven colon and pancreatic can-
cers (Kapoor et al., 2014; Shao et al., 2014). Upstream of the core kinase cassette is the tumor sup-
pressor Merlin (moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein), which is inactivated in Neurofibromatosis type 2
(NF2) (McClatchey et al., 1998). Functions for Merlin have been described in the nucleus (Li et al.,
2014, 2010) as well as at the plasma membrane (Yin et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2010).

In the mouse-liver, homozygous deletion of Nf2 results in tumor formation. However, heterozy-
gous deletion of Yap significantly suppresses the loss-of-Nf2 phenotype, thus implicating YAP as a
major downstream effector of NF2 (Zhang et al., 2010). Analysis of liver-specific Nf2 knockout mice
and Nf2:Amot double knockout (DKO) mice showed Amot is required for hepatic ductal cell

proliferation and tumor formation in the context of either Nf2 loss or DDC (3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-
1,4-dihydrocollidine)-induced injury. Additionally, substantially increased expression of Amot was
observed in NF2-null human schwannomas samples, which primarily displayed localization of Amot
in the nucleus (Yi et al., 2013). Further evidence demonstrated that in renal cell carcinoma (RCC),
Amot promotes the proliferation of renal epithelial and RCC cells, and is crucial for YAP transcrip-
tional activity by promoting its nuclear localization (Lv et al., 2016). However, it has also been
reported that Amot functions as a negative regulator of YAP activity, as direct association of Amot
junctions (Leung and Zernicka-Goetz, 2013;
and YAP results in translocation to cytoplasm/cell
Zhao et al., 2011). Moreover, a number of studies suggest that Amot acts as a scaffold protein to
promote localization of YAP, as well as other Hippo/YAP core kinases, to the cytoplasm/cell junc-
tions/actin cytoskeleton and promote Lats1/2-mediated phosphorylation of YAP (Chan et al., 2011;
Dai et al., 2013; Paramasivam et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011). One possible explanation for these
opposing regulatory functions of Amot could be attributed to post-translational modifications. Phos-
phorylation of Ser175 on human Amot (corresponding to Ser176 in mouse) at the conserved HVRSLS
motif by Lats1/2 has been reported as a key post-translational modification controlling Amot func-
tion and association with YAP (Hirate et al., 2013; Moleirinho et al., 2014). Here we show that
Amot-p130 functions as a scaffold protein mediating YAP and Merlin association and that phosphor-
ylation of Amot at Ser176 induces translocation of the complex from the cytoplasm and nucleus to
the plasma membrane. This relocalization of the Amot/YAP/Merlin complex significantly impacts the
activity of YAP and regulates YAP’s ability to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. These
results uncover an unrecognized layer of regulation in the Hippo-YAP pathway and resolve questions
regarding the seemingly opposing functions of Amot.

Results

Amot, YAP and Merlin form a complex that localizes to the nucleus and
cytoplasm
Previous work by multiple groups identified the p130 splice isoform of Angiomotin (Amot) as a bind-
ing partner of YAP and Merlin (Chan et al., 2011; Yi et al., 2013, 2011; Zhao et al., 2011). We first
thought to assess whether Amot-p130, YAP and Merlin form a complex and subsequently whether
this is dependent on Angiomotin phosphorylation. We used HEK293, as they express relatively high
levels of endogenous Angiomotin. First, to determine the interaction between Merlin and YAP,
HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged Merlin and V5-tagged YAP.
Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses using anti-HA or anti-V5 antibodies revealed
association between YAP and Merlin (Figure 1A). The Merlin-YAP interaction was also confirmed in
another independent cell type – the hSC2l immortalized human Schwann cells (Figure 1B). Impor-
tantly, further validation of the association between YAP and Merlin was confirmed at the endoge-
nous protein levels, using antibodies directed against Merlin or YAP (Figure 1C).

As previous studies reported multiple cellular localizations for Merlin and YAP, we sought to
determine the cellular compartments where YAP and Merlin co-localize. Flag-tagged Merlin and V5-
tagged YAP were co-transfected in both HEK293 and hSC2l cells and the localization and associa-
tion of these proteins were examined by subcellular fractionation coupled to IP with an anti-Flag
antibody. These subcellular fractionation studies showed an association between Merlin and YAP pri-
marily in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and to a much lesser extent at the plasma membrane
(Figure 1D–E). Further confirmation of Merlin and YAP co-localization was provided by immunofluo-
rescence (IF) staining, in HEK293 and hSC2l cells, where we observed co-localization of IF signal pre-
dominantly in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 1F). Thus, we conclude that YAP associates with
Merlin, co-localizing mostly in the cytoplasm and nucleus.

YAP-Merlin complex formation is dependent on Amot-p130
Since Amot directly binds YAP and Merlin through two distinct domains (Yi et al., 2013, 2011), we
hypothesized that Amot could act as a scaffold and recruit YAP and Merlin into the same complex.
To confirm this hypothesis we generated HEK293 cells stably expressing a lentiviral short hairpin
RNA specific to Amot (HEK293-shAmot cells). Co-IP experiments with HA-tagged Merlin and V5-
tagged YAP confirmed that in the absence of Amot, the complex is not formed as YAP and Merlin

could no longer be co-immunoprecipitated (Figure 2A). Similarly, knockdown of Amot using an
siRNA smartpool impaired the association of Merlin and YAP (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).

To further validate the scaffolding role of Amot we evaluated whether Amot-80 can support the
interaction between Merlin and YAP. Amot-p80 lacks the 409 amino acid N-terminus present in
Amot, which harbors the PPxY motifs (239PPEY242 and 284PPEY287), and an unconventional LPTY
motif (106LPTY109) that mediate the interaction with YAP (Ernkvist et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2012;
Yi et al., 2013) (Figure 2B). As expected, attempting to IP HA-Merlin or V5-YAP demonstrated that

Amot-p80 was unable to support the association between these proteins (Figure 2C). Moreover,
mutation of the individual PPEY/LPTY motifs or combinations thereof, significantly impaired the
association between Merlin and YAP (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Taken together, these results
show that Amot functions as a scaffold that supports the YAP-Merlin association.

Angiomotin phosphorylation does not impair formation of a YAP/
Merlin complex
Several reports have shown the importance of Amot post-translational modifications in regulating its
function, specifically phosphorylation of Serine 176 (Serine 175 in humans) (Adler et al., 2013a;
Chan et al., 2013; Dai et al., 2013; Hirate et al., 2013; Paramasivam et al., 2011). We therefore
explored whether Amot phosphorylation regulates formation of the Amot/YAP/Merlin complex.
HEK293-shAmot cells were transfected with expression vectors for Flag-Merlin, V5-YAP and either
HA-Amot-p130, HA-Amot-p130S176A (non-phosphorylated mutant) or HA-Amot-p130S176E (phospho-
mimetic mutant) and similar levels of the different Amot alleles were confirmed (Figure 3—figure
supplement 1). IPs were carried out using anti-Flag or anti-V5 antibodies and the presence of Merlin
and YAP was determined by western blotting. These analyses demonstrated that all three forms of
Amot support the formation of the complex, as evidenced by the co-IP of Merlin and YAP

(Figure 3A–C). Further validation of these results were demonstrated by co-IP experiments in which
Amot was IPed using an anti-HA antibody (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). In addition, we exam-
ined whether phosphorylated Amot is still able to bind both YAP and Merlin, by using an antibody
that specifically binds phosphorylated S176 (p-S176). The antibody was used to IP phosphorylated
Amot and co-IP of Merlin and YAP was assessed by western blotting. These experiments showed
that Amot phosphorylated at S176 binds to both YAP and Merlin. Similarly, IP with antibodies
against YAP or Merlin also showed co-IP with phosphorylated Amot (Figure 3D). Collectively, our
findings demonstrate that Amot S176 phosphorylation state does not affect formation of the Amot/
YAP/Merlin complex.

A major regulatory mechanism of YAP localization is through Lats1/2 phosphorylation of Ser127
promoting YAP cytoplasmic sequestration through 14-3-3 binding and concomitant sequestration
from the nucleus (Zhao et al., 2010b, 2007). We therefore evaluated whether YAP phosphorylation
at Serine 127 plays a role in the establishment of the Amot/YAP/Merlin complex. Using similar IP
approaches described above, we found that both phosphorylated YAP and constitutively active
YAPS127A mutant retain their ability to associate with Amot/Merlin (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).
Surprisingly, a YAP mutant where five major phosphorylation sites have been abolished (YAP-5A
[Zhao et al., 2010b]) was no longer associated with the complex (Figure 3—figure supplement
2C).

AmotS176 phosphorylation regulates YAP localization at the plasma
membrane
To determine whether phosphorylation induces a change in the sub-cellular localization of Amot/
YAP/Merlin complex, 293-shAmot cells were transfected with expression vectors for Amot-p130,
Amot-p130S176A or Amot-p130S176E. The transfected cells were fractionated and the presence of
Amot determined by Western blot analysis. In the cells expressing Amot-p130, the majority of this
protein localized to cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and to a lesser extent in the plasma mem-
brane fraction. Interestingly, Amot-p130S176A showed a marked increase in nuclear localization and
almost no presence at the plasma membrane. In contrast, Amot-p130S176E showed a clear shift in
localization towards the cytoplasm and plasma membrane (Figure 4A). Immunoblotting of total cell
extracts confirmed similar expression levels of Amot-p130, Amot-p130S176E and Amot-p130S176A
(Figure 4B). To determine the broader relevance of our findings in HEK293 cells to additional bio-
logical systems, we carried out a similar analysis in human hSC2l Schwann cells and HepG2 hepato-
cellular carcinoma cells. Fractionation studies from these additional cell types followed a similar
distribution pattern to the transfected 293-shAmot cells (Figure 4—figure supplements 1A and
2A).

To complement the biochemical fractionation studies, we assessed localization of the different
Amot proteins by IF staining in the 293-shAmot cells. These analyses confirmed the fractionation

findings, demonstrating a stronger intensity of Amot in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells express-
ing Amot-p130, a shift to nuclear staining in Amot-p130S176A expressing cells and cytoplasmic/
plasma membrane localization in Amot-p130S176E expressing cells (Figure 4C).

We next examined if the status of S176 can regulate localization of the Amot/YAP/Merlin com-
plex. First, we examined Amot/YAP localization using co-IP studies in fractions prepared from 293-
shAmot cells transfected with expression vectors for Amot-p130, Amot-p130S176A or Amot-
p130S176E. In agreement with our previous results, in 293-shAmot cells transfected with Amot-p130
and YAP, Amot co-IPed with YAP mainly in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus with little to no
interaction detected at the plasma membrane (Figure 4D). Importantly, in cells expressing the
Amot-p130S176A allele, the Amot-YAP complex mainly localized to the nucleus with little to no inter-
action detected in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane (Figure 4E). Significantly, in cells expressing
the Amot-p130S176E allele an increase in the Amot-YAP association was detected at the plasma
membrane, in addition to the cytoplasmic fraction. Little to no interaction was detected in the
nucleus (Figure 4F). Thus, the distribution of Amot/YAP complex mimics the distribution observed
for Amot (Figure 4A). In addition to the analysis in the 293-shAmot cells, a similar analysis carried
out in the hSC2l and HepG2 cells confirmed a similar distribution pattern (Figure 4—figure supple-
ments 1B–D and 2B–D).

These findings were extended and confirmed by IF analysis of the YAP-Merlin association in 293-
shAmot cells, where the localization of YAP and Merlin to the plasma membrane is significantly
enhanced in cells expressing the Amot-p130S176E allele (Figure 4G). Overall our findings demon-
strate that while AmotS176 phosphorylation does not impact the formation of the Amot/YAP/Merlin
complex, it mediates the localization of the complex through phosphorylation of Serine 176 that
leads to recruitment of the complex to the plasma membrane or a shift to a nuclear localization in
the hypophosphorylated state.

Phosphorylation of Amot promotes localization to junctional structures
at the plasma membrane
Previous studies showed binding of Amot to the tight junction-associated proteins Pals1 and Patj at
the apical membrane (Ernkvist et al., 2009; Sugihara-Mizuno et al., 2007; Wells et al., 2006;
Yi et al., 2011). To further characterize the mechanisms by which phosphorylated Amot shifts from
the cytoplasm and nucleus to the plasma membrane, we examined the interactions between Amot-
p130, Amot-p130S176A and Amot-p130S176E with Patj, Pals1 and E-cadherin. Using co-IP, we found
that Flag-tagged Patj strongly associates with Amot-p130S176E, compared to weaker or null interac-
tion with Amot-p130 and Amot-p130S176A, respectively. In a reciprocal approach, IP of the different
Amot forms demonstrated a stronger association between Patj and Amot-p130S176E (Figure 5A–C).
Similar results were obtained when examining the association of Pals1 or E-cadherin with Amot.
While we were consistently able to co-IP Pals1 or E-cadherin with Amot-p130S176E, this association
was greatly diminished with Amot-p130S176A or wild type Amot-p130 (Figure 5D–E). These findings
suggest that localization of phosphorylated Amot-p130 to the cell membrane is mediated through
interactions with components of junctional structures, which remain to be identified.

Previous reports concluded that phosphorylation of Amot at Serine 176 reduces the association
between Amot and F-actin (Chan et al., 2013; Mana-Capelli et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2013). To
assess this directly in cells, we employed a co-precipitation approach relying on the high selectivity
and binding affinity of phalloidin to F-actin, previously employed to identify F-actin binding proteins
in cells (Clarke and Mearow, 2013; Fulga et al., 2007). Briefly, biotinylated phalloidin was used to
specifically pull-down F-actin from 293-shAmot cells transfected with expression vectors for Amot-
p130, Amot-p130S176A or Amot-p130S176E and levels of precipitated proteins were examined by
western blotting. As shown in Figure 5F, similar amounts of all Amot proteins were present in the
pull downs (Upper panel). Importantly, similar levels of Actin were present in all pull downs indicat-
ing the expression of the different Amot alleles did not affect cellular levels of F-actin (Lower panel).

Amot phosphorylation regulates YAP-driven cellular proliferation and
transcriptional activities
Given the impact of Amot-p130S176 phosphorylation on localization of the Amot/YAP/Merlin com-
plex, we conducted loss- and gain-of-function studies to gain insight into the functional significance

of this phosphorylation. First, we determined whether AmotS176 phosphorylation modulates cell pro-
liferation. The 293-shAmot cells transfected with expression plasmids for Amot-p130 and Amot-
p130S176A proliferated at increased rates compared to control transfected cells, as determined by
cell counting and BrdU incorporation over a 96 hr period. In contrast, the Amot-p130S176E express-
ing cells exhibited a growth rate comparable to that of the control cells (Figure 6A–B). Similar
results were obtained in hSC2l and HepG2 cells transfected with the different Amot alleles (Fig-
ure 6—figure supplement 1A–B). These findings indicate that expression of Amot can promote the
proliferation of these three different cell types and that this activity is diminished when Amot is phos-
phorylated at Serine 176.

As work from our group and others has shown that Angiomotin functions as a regulator of small
G-proteins from the Rac1/cdc42 family (Wells et al., 2006; Yi et al., 2011), we assessed whether the
increased proliferation observed in the Amot-p130 and Amot-p130S176A expressing cells is mediated
by activation of Rac1. Towards this goal we analyzed the status of active Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) in these
cells compared to control 293-shAmot cells. As expected, transfection with the different Amot
alleles resulted in increased Rac1-GTP levels. However, we found no significant differences in Rac1-
GTP levels between the cells, suggesting the status of Amot serine 176 phosphorylation does not
affect Rac1 activation (Figure 6C).

We next determined whether the observed increased rates of cell proliferations induced by
Amot-p130 and Amot-p130S176A expression are YAP-dependent, by introducing two independent
siRNAs against YAP into these cells. Indeed, the increased proliferation afforded by Amot-p130 and
Amot-p130S176A was completely inhibited by YAP knockdown (Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure sup-
plement 2A). The expression of Amot-p130 and Amot-p130S176A and reduction of YAP levels was
confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure 6B).

Next, we determined if Amot Serine 176 phosphorylation regulates YAP-mediated transcriptional
activation. We used two independent luciferase reporter assays, the HIP/HOP-flash and 8xGTIIC
luciferase reporters (Leask and Abraham, 2006; Zhao et al., 2008). The HIP (Hippo-YAP signaling
incompetent promoter)/HOP (Hippo-YAP signaling optimal promoter)-flash reporters contain,
respectively, seven mutated TEAD-binding sites and multimerized (x8) TEAD-binding sites from the
promoter of YAP’s direct target CTGF (Leask and Abraham, 2006; Zhao et al., 2008). The former
is a negative control for HOP-flash activity (Kim and Gumbiner, 2015). In agreement with our previ-
ously reported findings (Yi et al., 2013), the activity of YAP in the HOP-reporter assay was sup-
pressed in 293-shAmot cells, while the reintroduction of Amot fully rescued YAP activity (Figure 6D–
E). Moreover, the expression of Amot-p130S176A resulted in a substantial increase in the activation
of the HOP-flash reporter when compared to Amot. Significantly, Amot-p130S176E was unable to res-
cue the function of YAP in the 293-shAmot cells (Figure 6D–E). As expected, no significant changes
in activation of the HIP reporter were observed under similar experimental conditions (Figure 6D).
These observations were further confirmed using the GTIIC luciferase system, which has eight copies
of TEAD-binding sequence driving the expression of the luciferase gene (Davidson et al., 1988;
Ota and Sasaki, 2008; Yi et al., 2013) (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B).

To further evaluate the regulation of YAP’s activity by Amot, we investigated the impact of Amot-
p130, Amot-p130S176A and Amot-p130S176E expression in the 293-shAmot cells on known gene tar-
gets of YAP by quantitative real-time PCR. We focused on Areg (amphiregulin) and ApoE (Apolipo-
protein E) as previous findings suggest Amot plays a role in their regulation (Yi et al., 2013). While
expression of both Amot-p130 and Amot-p130S176E had only minor effects on levels of Areg and
ApoE, the expression of Amot-p130S176A significantly induced up-regulation of Areg and ApoE by
2.5, and 3-fold respectively, relative to control cells (Figure 6F). Similar results were obtained in
hSC2l and HepG2 cells transfected with the different Amot alleles (Figure 6—figure supplement
3).

Previously it was shown that Amot is part of transcriptionally active YAP-Tead-containing complex
in the nuclei of adult liver and HEK293 cells (Yi et al., 2013). We hypothesized that Amot exerts its
function in this complex in the dephosphorylated state. To test this, we performed reciprocal IP
assays with antibodies against YAP or pan-Tead. We observed efficient co-IP of YAP and pan-Tead

in the presence of Amot-p130 and Amot-p130S176A but not in the presence of Amot-p130S176E
(Figure 7A). Moreover, we conducted Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with Amot antibodies
in 293-shAmot cells transfected with Amot-p130, Amot-p130S176A or an empty control vector, fol-
lowed by RT-PCR analysis. These experiments showed a striking enrichment and binding of Amot-
p130S176A to the promoter of ApoE and Areg, compared to Amot (Figure 7B). These findings sug-
gest that phosphorylation of Amot serine 176 prevents YAP-mediated transcriptional activation by
inhibiting Amot nuclear function as a co-factor in a YAP-Tead transcriptional complex (Figure 7C).

Discussion
The role of Angiomotin regulating the Hippo/YAP pathway has so far been elusive, mainly due to
conflicting reports suggesting that YAP regulation by Angiomotin is either positive or negative. To
gain a deeper understanding of Amot function, we employed multiple cell types originating from tis-
sues in which dysregulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway is observed under pathological conditions.
Our study reveals that Angiomotin phosphorylation at serine 176 mediates YAP localization. This
post-translational modification is the key event determining a promoting or repressing regulation of
YAP by Angiomotin. We found that phosphorylation at serine 176 does not mediate Angiomotin’s
scaffolding functions but does impact the localization of a tertiary complex composed by Amot, YAP
and Merlin, which is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus for the wild type protein. The serine
176 phosphomimetic mutant (AmotS176E) is recruited to the plasma membrane where it is found co-
localized and associated with Patj, Pals1 and E-cadherin at junctional structures. Our previous studies
indicate that Amot is required for YAP function in the nucleus (Yi et al., 2013). Thus, the relocation
of Amot out of the nucleus and sequestration of Amot/YAP complex to the plasma membrane, func-
tion to prevent YAP from operating as a growth-promoting transcriptional activator. The non-phos-
phorylated mutant (AmotS176A) is preferentially localized to the nucleus, where it facilitates YAP
interactions with TEADs and concomitant activation of target gene transcription.

Angiomotin’s involvement in regulation of Hippo-YAP signaling arises from studies showing that
Amot functions as a scaffold protein for several components of this signaling cascade including YAP,
Merlin, Kibra, Lats, and F-actin (Moleirinho et al., 2014). Our findings extend Amot scaffolding func-
tions to the formation of the YAP-Merlin complex independent of Amot Ser176 phosphorylation,
although it is possible that additional PTMs might regulate the complex specifically at different sub-
cellular localizations. Multiple reports describe the role of AmotS176 phosphorylation on Amot inter-
actions with binding partners and function (Adler et al., 2013b; Chan et al., 2013; Hirate et al.,
2013; Mana-Capelli et al., 2014). While these reports converge towards the idea that Amot serine
176 phosphorylation is mediated by Lats1/2 and that this impacts Amot’s binding to F-actin, they
differ significantly when examining the influence on Amot localization and function. Whilst the dis-
cussion of these differences merits a separate review, we highlight a few points that agree or conflict
with our current findings. In regards to the effect of Amot phosphorylation on binding to F-actin or
YAP, previous reports conclude that serine 176 phosphorylation impairs the interaction between
Amot and F-actin and suggest that this can favor binding to YAP (Chan et al., 2013; Mana-
Capelli et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2013). Our findings suggest that serine 176 phosphorylation does
not impact association with F-actin. However, in agreement with one of these studies (Dai et al.,
2013) our findings suggest that phosphorylation on Amot has little impact on the Amot-YAP associa-
tion. Possible explanations for the differences between our current findings and previous reports
could be attributed to the use of HEK293 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Amot, which

Conversely, phosphorylation of AmotS176 induces cytoplasmic sequestration and plasma membrane localization of the tertiary complex. At the
membrane, the complex associates with the junctional proteins Patj and Pals1 and YAP’s nuclear functions are inhibited. S176 in blue indicates
phosphorylation.

might mask some of the interactions with the mutated alleles. To circumvent this possibility, our
studies incorporated HEK293 cells in which endogenous Amot expression was knocked-down and
the different mutant alleles reintroduced. Additionally, previous studies used different cell types,
which not only could impact the stability of the Amot/YAP interaction but also explain the observed
differences in Amot localization. In MCF10A, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, hypophosphorylated
Amot showed junctional
localization and co-localization with F-actin (Adler et al., 2013b;
Chan et al., 2013). Although we cannot exclude differences in the actin cytoskeleton between the
different cell lines used in those studies, we observe enrichment of AmotS176E to the plasma mem-
brane, in agreement with Hirate et al. (2013), and enrichment of AmotS176A to the nucleus. Further-
more, our studies confirm previous findings and show that Amot is required for YAP activity and that
the AmotS176A mutant displays prominent nuclear function by means of increased levels of YAP tar-
get gene expression,
increased cell proliferation rates and higher colony formation capacity
(Adler et al., 2013b; Chan et al., 2013; Hirate et al., 2013). Importantly, in vivo studies are needed
to clarify the role of Amot in different cell and tissue types. We further extended the analysis of
Amot phosphorylation on the Amot-YAP-Merlin complex, by determining whether its formation
depends on YAPS127 phosphorylation site. In agreement with previous reports showing that the
Amot-YAP interaction is independent of phosphorylation at YAPS127 (Wang et al., 2011;
Zhao et al., 2011), we observed that the YAP-Merlin-Angiomotin complex also occurs indepen-
dently of YAPS127 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and B). Interestingly, mutation of serine in each
of YAP’s five HxRxxS consensus sites (S5A, Zhao et al., 2010b) precluded formation of the complex
(Figure 3—figure supplement 3C). The molecular mechanisms underlying the reduced association
between the S5A and the Amot-merlin complex remain to be elucidated. However, this is not likely
as a result of increased nuclear localization of YAP-S5A, since wild-type Amot can also be found in
the nucleus in complex with wild type YAP. Therefore, it is likely that at least one additional post-
translational modification of YAP could regulate the formation of the Amot-YAP-Merlin complex and
future studies are needed to identify this modification.

We found that AmotS176 phosphorylation induces association of the YAP-Merlin complex with
Patj, Pals1 and E-cadherin, and that plasma membrane sequestration inhibits YAP activity. Several
reports have described the localization of Amot at junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells
(Bratt et al., 2005; Ernkvist et al., 2008; Patrie, 2005; Wells et al., 2006) and its colocalization
with Patj/Pals1 via its C-terminal PDZ-binding motifs (Wells et al., 2006). However, binding to Patj is
not required for Amot’s localization to the plasma membrane, as a mutant lacking the PDZ binding

motifs still localize to the cell cortex (Sugihara-Mizuno et al., 2007). This suggests that an additional
mechanism can regulate Amot membrane localization, which is in agreement with our findings where
phosphorylation of AmotS176 induces localization of Amot-YAP-Merlin complex to the cell cortex. In
HeLa, HEK293 and MDCK cells, Amot mediates YAP localization at the plasma membrane resulting
in suppression of cell proliferation (Chan et al., 2011; Paramasivam et al., 2011; Zhao et al.,
2011). Thus, we propose that phosphorylation of Amot triggers a shift of the YAP-Merlin complex
from the nucleus to the plasma membrane, thus suppressing the nuclear activity of YAP and exerting
cell growth and tumor suppressive functions (Figure 7C).

Amot associates with Merlin and Rich1 at junctional structures and inhibits Rac1 and downstream
signaling into the MAPK pathway (Yi et al., 2011). Our results suggest that AmotS176 phosphoryla-
tion does not impact the ability to modulate Rac1 activity at the cell membrane. Yet, it is possible
that AmotS176 phosphorylation modulates Merlin’s nuclear function. Previous studies showed that
nuclear accumulation of Merlin results in inhibition of the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. In NF2-
mutant tumors, CRL4DCAF1 ubiquitinates Lats, suppressing phosphorylation and activating YAP
(Li et al., 2014, 2010). In light of our findings, we can speculate that in the nucleus, Lats is inacti-
vated by CRL4DCAF1-driven ubiquitylation and becomes unable to phosphorylate Amot, resulting in
an increase of YAP transcriptional activity. However, if Lats remains active and Amot phosphorylation
occurs, Amot-YAP-Merlin tertiary complex translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and
plasma membrane, resulting in suppression of YAP nuclear functions. Future studies will be required
to shed light on this possibility.

Another open question pertains to what mechanism/s regulate Angiomotin/YAP localization.
Lats1/2 are obvious candidates, as they were shown to phosphorylate both YAP and Amot
(Adler et al., 2013b; Chan et al., 2013; Hirate et al., 2013; Mana-Capelli et al., 2014). However,
the role of Lats1/2 in regulation of these proteins and the relationship between Lats, YAP and Angio-
motin is complex. For example, a number of reports suggest that Lats phosphorylates Amot, leading
to reduced binding to F-actin and increased YAP binding and inhibition (Chan et al., 2013; Mana-
Capelli et al., 2014). Moreover, Amot has been proposed to activate Lats2 and increase phosphory-
lation of YAP (Paramasivam et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2013). In contrast, we have previously shown
that in multiple systems, Amot antagonizes the association of Lats and YAP and inhibits phosphoryla-
tion of YAP by Lats (Yi et al., 2013). Given the complexity of the interactions between Amot and
YAP, addressing the role of Lats1/2 in regulating the translocation and activity of the Amot-YAP
complex will require future studies. Another potential regulatory mechanism stems from the lack of
interaction between Amot and YAP-S5A mentioned above. This finding suggests that additional
phosphorylation events could regulate the complex. As a number of other kinases such as AMPK
and CK1delta/epsilon have been shown to phosphorylate YAP (Wang et al., 2015; Zhao et al.,
2010a). Further work will be required to determine the relevant phosphorylation sites and responsi-
ble kinases

In conclusion, our studies suggest a mechanism to explain the previous conflicting observations
regarding the role of Amot by demonstrating that AmotS176 phosphorylation state is a key event
that dictates a positive or negative regulation of YAP by Amot by targeting the Amot-YAP-Merlin
complex to the plasma membrane, sequestration in the cytoplasm or translocation to the nucleus.

Materials and methods

Plasmids and siRNAs
The expression plasmids for HA-Amot-p130, HA-Amot-p130S176A and HA-Amot-p130S176E were a
gift from Dr. Hiroshi Sasaki (Kumamoto University, Japan). The following plasmids were previously
described: psCMV-Pals1-Flag; PATJ-Flag (Wells et al., 2006; Yi et al., 2011); Flag or HA-tagged
Merlin (Kissil et al., 2002, 2003); pCMV-Flag-Amot-p80, pCMV-V5-YAP and pCMV-Amot-130 LPxY/
PPxY mutants (Yi et al., 2011, Yi et al., 2013). The pcDNA4/His-MaxB-YAP-S127A (Plasmid #18988)
and pCMV-Flag-YAP-5SA (Plasmid #27371) were from Addgene. Human Amot-p130 shRNA vectors
have been previously described (Yi et al., 2011). siRNA duplexes targeting human YAP (ID #s20366)
as well as non-targeting control siRNAs (ID #4390843) were from Thermo Fischer Scientific (Carls-
bad, CA). The second siRNA targeting human YAP1 (5 FlexiTube #SI02662954) was purchased from
Qiagen. siRNA targeting human angiomotin (ON-TARGETplus Human AMOT siRNA- smartpool

L-015417-01-0005) or control pool of siRNA (ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting pool-set of 4 LU-
017595-01-0002).

Cell culture, transfection, and infection conditions
HEK293 and HepG2 cells were purchased from the ATCC. hSC2l cells were obtained from the labo-
ratory of Dr. Margret Wallace (Li et al., 2016). All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem
repeat (STR) DNA profiling (DDC Medical). Cells were tested every 3 months for mycoplasma con-
tamination and confirmed free of contamination. Cells were maintained in low glucose Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biolog-
icals) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml Streptomycin) (Gibco), at 37˚C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 (v/v). All experiments were carried out on cells grown to 70–80%
confluency. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
unless stated otherwise. Lentiviral infection of HEK293 cells was performed according to standard
protocols. Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with packaging plasmids VSVG, D8.2, and
either with pLKO.1-GFP or pLKO.1-shAmot constructs. Supernatants were collected 48 hr and 72 hr
after transfection, and cells were infected with 4 mL of viral supernatant containing 4 mL of poly-
brene (8 mg/mL). After 48 hr, transduced cells were selected with puromycin (2 mg/mL) and this
selection maintained for 72 hr.

Antibodies

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
150 cm diameter dishes were transiently transfected with 10 mg of plasmid DNAs using Lipofect-
amine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 hr later cell lysates were collected, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and
lysed with radioimmuno precipitation assay buffer (RIPA: 50 mM Tris-HCl; 150 mM NaCl; 1% NP40;
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 1:25 protease inhibitor cocktail and phos-
phatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). 1 mg of protein was immunoprecipitated with Protein
A/G resins (#20333; #20398; Thermo Scientific) and indicated antibody with gentle rotation at 4˚C,
overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in RIPA buffer, and bound proteins were dis-
sociated in 25 mL of 1x loading dye (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% glycerol, bromophenol
blue). Eluted proteins were separated on SDS/10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Immobi-
lon-P membranes (Millipore). To prevent nonspecific binding, membranes were incubated in block-
ing buffer (5% skimmed dried milk, 33.3 mM Tris-HCl, 16.68 mM Tris base, 138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM
KCl, 0.1% Tween-20) with agitation for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by immediate incubation
with specific antibodies diluted in either 5% BSA or blocking buffer, overnight. Membranes were
then washed three times in washing buffer (33.3 mM Tris-HCl, 16.68 mM Tris base; 138 mM NaCl;
2.7 mM KCl; 0.1% Tween-20), incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with goat anti-mouse HRP-
conjugated antibody (sc-2005; 1:10000) or Protein A-HRP linked (NA9120V; 1: 2000; GE Healthcare)
and protein expression was detected by chemiluminescence using ECL (#RPN2106 or #RPN2236,
GE Healthcare).

F-actin pull down assay
Cells were collected and lysed with actin stabilization buffer (1% Triton-X 100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM
EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 200 pM sodium vanadate, 200 pM NaF, 1 complete protease inhib-
itor cocktail tablet, 0.5 mM ATP and Tris-Buffered Saline, pH 7.4). Biotinylated-phalloidin (5 mg,
Thermo-Fisher Scientific) was added to samples and incubated for 60’ at 4˚C with constant rotation.
Subsequently, 20 mL of streptavidin-coupled magnetic Dynabeads were added, incubated for 60’ at
4˚C with constant rotation. The magnetic beads were isolated with a magnet, washed 3X with PBS
and analyzed as described.

Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as previously described (Li et al., 2010). Briefly, cells
were grown on coverslips and transfected the next day using Lipofectamine. After 48 hr, coverslips
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and incubated in per-
meabilization buffer (0.3% sodium deoxycholate and 0.3% Triton-X in PBS) for 30 min on ice. Cover-
slips were then washed twice in PBS and blocked in 5% goat serum/0.3% Triton-X in PBS for 1 hr at
room temperature followed by overnight incubation with indicated primary antibodies. After three
PBS washes, coverslips were incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (#A11029, 1:400; Life
Technologies), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (#A11011, 1:400; Life Technologies) or both second-
ary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were stained 5 min with 1 mg/mL of DAPI or
Hoechst and mounted in Vectashield. Slides were examined using confocal microscopy (LSM 780;
Carl Zeiss; Plan Neofluar 63x/1.3 NA Korr differential interference contrast M27 objective in water)
at room temperature. Digitalized images were assembled using ZEN 2011 (64 bit) software (Carl
Zeiss).

Sub-cellular fractionation
Cells were incubated on ice for 20 min in ice-cold cytoplasmic buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150
mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 0.5%Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture),
centrifuged at 4000 g for 5’ at 4˚C. Supernatant was kept for the cytosolic and plasma membrane
fractions. The pellet was washed five times with nuclear washing buffer (10 mM HEPES pH7.9, 10
mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M Sucrose, and complete protease inhibitor mixture), lysed on ice for
20 min in 400 ml of RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min at 4˚C. Supernatant was kept
as the nuclear fraction. For the cytosolic and plasma membrane fractions the supernatant was spun
at 200,000 g for 30 min at 4˚C and the resultant supernatant centrifuged again at 13,000g for 5 min
at 4˚C and kept as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed in 500 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH
7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, and complete protease inhibitor mixture) and re-
sedimented at 200,000g for 30 min at 4˚C. The pellet was then resuspended in ice-cold IP buffer (1
M Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 4 M NaCl, 10% (w/v) Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mixture),
incubated on a rocker for 30 min at 4˚C, and cleared by centrifugation at 13,000g for 15 min at 4˚C.
The supernatant was kept as the plasma membrane fraction.

Immunoprecipitation and Rac1-GTP pull-down
HEK293-shAmot cells were transfected with 8 mg of plasmid DNA (empty vector control/ wild type
Amot-p130/AmotS176A/AmotS176E) and 48 hr later lysed in RIPA buffer and precipitated with indi-
cated antibody overnight. Rac1-GTP was pulled down according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Millipore, #17–441).

BrdU incorporation assay
HEK293-shAmot cells were seeded at a cell density of 2  105 cells per well in 6-well plates. On the
following day cells were co-transfected with 40 nM of siRNAs (targeting either YAP or a non-target-
ing siRNA duplex (control)), and 2 mg of plasmid DNA (empty vector control/ wild type Amot-p130/
AmotS176A/AmotS176E) using TransIT-LT1 and TransIT-TKO (Mirus, Fisher Scientific, Illinois) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 hr, cells were trypsinized and 2  104 cells/well were
reseeded in sterile 96-well tissue culture plates. 48 hr, 72 hr, and 96 hr after co-transfection, plates
were processed and analysed using BrdU cell proliferation assay kit following manufacturer’s

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
Extraction of RNA from cell lysates was performed using Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) followed by
cDNA synthesis of 1 mg DNase-digested RNA, using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for
quantitative RT–PCR (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR of the
synthesized cDNA was conducted using SYBR Green 2x Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. 10 ng of each sample were used in each analysis. Real-time quantita-
tive RT-PCR reactions were performed on StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems)
and analysed using StepOne Software v2.2.2. All measurements were conducted three times in tripli-
cate and standardized to the levels of GADPH. Relative changes in gene expression were calculated
according to the 2 DDCT algorithm (Livak et al., 2001). Sequence of the qPCR primers is provided in
Table 1.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and qPCR analysis
20 million HEK293T-shAmot cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at RT. Fixation was
halted with 125 mM glycine for 5 min at RT. Fixed cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Cell pel-
lets were then resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer and chromatin was sheared with sonicator to obtain
0.3–0.5 kb DNA fragments. Angiomotin antibody (5 mg) and Dynabeads Protein A were added to
the cell lysate and incubated overnight at 4˚C. Beads were washed with buffer 1 (150 mM NaCL, 20
mM TrisCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 65% w/v sucrose, 10% Triton-X-100, 20% SDS) and then washed
with TE buffer. DNA was eluted by resuspending the beads in TE/1%SDS. ChIP DNA and Input were
treated with RNase A (5 mg) for 1 hr at 37˚C. Proteinase K (0.5 mg/mL) was added and incubated
overnight at 65˚C to reverse crosslinking. DNA was then purified phenol:chloroform and resus-
pended in a 30 mL of elution buffer. DNA was used for real time-PCR using SYBR Green PCR kit. A
standard dilution curve was obtained for each Input and 1 mL of ChIP DNA was used in each PCR
reaction. Melt curves were analyzed to confirm specificity of the amplified target.
