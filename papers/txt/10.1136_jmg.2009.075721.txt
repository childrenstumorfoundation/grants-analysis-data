ABSTRACT 

Schwannomas and meningiomas are both part of the tumour spectrum of neurofibromatosis 

type 2 (NF2) and are associated with somatic loss of chromosome 22. They are also found 

commonly within the general population, unrelated to NF2. Germline SMARCB1 mutations 

have recently been identified as a pathogenic cause of a subset of familial schwannomatosis 

cases and is a candidate gene for causation of  both schwannomas and meningiomas. 

Recently, Bacci et al reported a germline SMARCB1 mutation associated with familial 

schwannomatosis and multiple meningiomas. They concluded that SMARCB1 mutations can 

predispose to multiple meningiomas. We screened the SMARCB1 gene in a panel of 47 

patients with multiple meningioma unrelated to NF2 and found no germline mutations. We 

conclude that while meningiomas may be associated with the schwannomatosis phenotype, 

SMARCB1 is not a major contributor to multiple meningioma disease.

INTRODUCTION 

Bacci et al recently reported a germline SMARCB1/INI1 mutation associated with familial 

schwannomatosis and multiple meningiomas. [1] They identified a missense p.Glu31Val 

variant in SMARCB1 which segregated with schwannomatosis, multiple meningiomas or both 

conditions and concluded that SMARCB1 mutations predispose to multiple meningiomas. 

The relationship between schwannomas and meningiomas is well established. Both are key 

diagnostic features of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) [2], associated with loss of 

heterozygosity of chromosome 22 and more specifically with mutations in the NF2 gene. [3,4] 

Other genes on chromosome 22, including SMARCB1, have been identified as candidates for 

both schwannomatosis and meningiomas. Previously, we described germline mutations in 

SMARCB1 in a subset of patients with familial and sporadic schwannomatosis (MIM 162091). 

[5] In this cohort of 43 individuals, a single patient in a family with schwannomatosis and a 

SMARCB1 mutation was affected with a spinal meningioma. In a previous screen of 126 

meningiomas, four (3%) carried an identical somatic missense mutation in exon 9 

(p.Arg377His) of SMARCB1. [6] A subsequent study using targeted screening of exons 1, 4, 5 

and 9 of SMARCB1 in 80 meningiomas [7] revealed a single mutation (an insertion of a 

cytosine that resulted in removal of the normal stop codon and elongation of the SMARCB1 

protein by an additional 59 amino acids). Hence, SMARCB1 mutation may be considered a 

rare contributor to the pathogenesis of meningioma formation. 

Previously, we have shown that multiple meningiomas in adulthood are unlikely to be due to 

germline mutations in the NF2 gene (no mutations found in 23 adults with multiple 

meningiomas, including eight familial samples) although mosaic involvement may be quite 

common [8]. We have now investigated the SMARCB1 gene as a potential cause of multiple 

meningiomas.

METHODS 

Patients and samples 

Here we define multiple meningiomas as two or more separate meningiomas in the same 

individual, but include affected relatives if a first degree relative of an individual with more 

than one meningioma has developed a single meningioma. We have now extended our 

analysis of germline DNA samples from patients with multiple meningiomas to 47 individuals 

from unrelated families, including 8 families containing more than one affected individual. 

The NF2 gene was analysed for all exons as previously described [8] but the additional 24 

samples were all tested using direct sequencing and Multiple Ligation Dependant Probe 

Amplification: this combination has been shown by us to have 92% sensitivity [9]. In the 

current study, we have screened this select group of patients with multiple meningiomas 

without pathogenic germline NF2 mutations and without additional evidence of NF2 (no 

vestibular schwannomas and no family history of NF2) or schwannomatosis, for mutations in 

the SMARCB1 gene. Forty seven individuals with multiple meningiomas were included in the 

study. None of the patients have a family history of NF2 and were all are negative for 

pathogenic germline NF2 mutations. Thirty nine patients were sporadic cases and eight were 

from families with more than one affected individual. Tumour samples were available from 

eight individuals (six with a matched blood sample {sporadic} and two with no blood sample 

available {familial}). Approval for this study was provided by the local ethics committee. 

 

Mutational Analysis 

Genomic DNA was extracted from blood lymphocytes of each patient and the SMARCB1 

gene was screened by direct sequencing of exons 1-9, using an ABI Prism 3100 sequence 

analyser (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 

was used to establish exon copy number variations, using the ABI Prism 7900 sequence

detection system (Applied Biosystems). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 22q was determined 

using the microsatellite markers: D22S303, D22S310, D22S446, D22S449, D22S1174, 

D22S275, NF2CA3, and D22S268. PCR products amplified by FAM labelled oligonucleotide 

primers were analysed on an ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). [4]

RESULTS 

We screened blood DNA from 45 patients with non-NF2 related multiple meningiomas and 

tumour DNA was screened from six of these. A further two tumour samples with no matching 

blood were also screened. No SMARCB1 mutations were identified in germline DNA. Two of 

the eight meningiomas tested positive for an NF2 mutation (sporadic) and loss of 

heterozygosity at the NF2 locus. A further sporadic tumour sample was identified with a 

heterozygous deletion of chromosome 22 encompassing SMARCB1 and NF2. No other 

SMARCB1 or NF2 mutations were identified.

DISCUSSION 

Our study shows that SMARCB1 mutations are not commonly associated with the 

development of  multiple meningiomas. Mutations in the SMARCB1 gene are associated with 

a range of cancer syndromes, including the aggressive paediatric cancer syndrome malignant 

rhabdoid tumours (MRT) [10] and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) [11]. Recently, they 

have also been identified in individuals and families with the benign tumour syndrome 

schwannomatosis [4, 11,13,14]. 

 

We have now extended our schwannomatosis cohort to include 28 individuals from 11 

families, with pathogenic SMARCB1 mutations. Only the one patient we previously reported 

had a spinal meningioma resected aged 61 years, but none had cranial meningiomas. It is 

therefore possible that meningiomas are an inconstant feature of SMARCB1 mutation and 

could be part of the schwannomatosis tumour phenotype. We conclude that SMARCB1 is not 

a major contributor to multiple meningioma disease. Definition of the modifiers directing the 

phenotypic expression of meningiomas and schwannomas will have important implications 

for disease management.
