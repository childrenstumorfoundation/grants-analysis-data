Summary Recent studies have identified somatic alterations in the gene encoding for neurofibromin (NF1) in
a subset of glioblastoma (GBM), usually associated with the mesenchymal molecular subtype. To understand
the significance of NF1 genetic alterations in diffuse gliomas in general, we evaluated public databases and
tested for NF1 copy number alterations in a cohort using fluorescence in situ hybridization. NF1 genetic loss
(homozygous NF1 deletions or mutations with predicted functional consequences) was present in 30 (of 281)
(11%) GBM and 21 (of 286) (7%) lower-grade gliomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Furthermore, NF1
loss was associated with worse overall and disease-specific survival in the lower-grade glioma, but not GBM,
Group in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. IDH1 or 2 mutations co-existed in lower-grade gliomas with NF1
loss (36%) but not in GBM. In our cohort studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization, NF1/17q (n = 2) or
whole Ch17 (n = 3) losses were only identified in the GBM group (5/86 [6%]). Tumors with NF1/Ch17 loss
were predominantly adult GBM (4/5); lacked EGFR amplification (0/4), strong p53 immunolabeling (1/5), or
IDH1 (R132H) protein expression (0/5); but expressed the mesenchymal marker podoplanin in 4/5. NF1
genetic loss occurs in a subset of diffuse gliomas, and its significance deserves further exploration.

1. Introduction

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic tumor-predisposing
syndrome caused by germline mutations in the NF1 gene and is
inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion [1,2]. The NF1 gene,
located at chromosome region 17q11.2, encodes neurofibromin,
a tumor suppressor that works primarily by regulating RAS but

also modulates adenyl cyclase [3,4]. NF1 loss generally leads to
increased activity in a variety of pro-tumorigenic pathways,
particularly the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway
(Fig. 1). Patients with NF1 are predisposed to a variety of
tumors affecting the central and peripheral nervous system. In the
central nervous system, the predominant tumor type is pilocytic
astrocytoma, which in this patient population has a propensity to
involve the optic pathways. However, NF1 patients, especially
adults, may develop gliomas of all types and grades [5]. In a large
retrospective study of NF1-associated gliomas classified using
current World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, 27% were
diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas, and 22% were high grade
(ie, anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas) [6].

Cellular pathways affected by neurofibromin loss. Neurofibromin is an important tumor suppressor that negatively regulates RAS by
driving it to the GDP bound state. Neurofibromin loss therefore leads to constitutive RAS activation and MEK/ERK signaling, resulting in
pro-tumorigenic signals. Neurofibromin also has a lesser known function acting through adenyl cyclase (AC) (dotted arrow).

A role for NF1 loss in sporadic astrocytomas has also
been elucidated more recently. Sporadic pilocytic astrocyto-
mas do not have alterations in NF1 [7], but rather BRAF
fusions or mutations [8–11], as well as activating mutations
in other oncogenes [12,13]. However, early clues that
alterations in the NF1 gene may be important
in the
development of diffusely infiltrating gliomas were provided
by mouse models in which Nf1 and Tp53 co-inactivation led
to glioblastoma formation with high,
if not complete,
penetrance [14,15]. More recent large-scale comprehensive
analyses have identified somatic alterations in the NF1 gene
in a subset of glioblastoma [16,17], usually associated with
the mesenchymal molecular subtype [18].

The mesenchymal molecular subtype was initially
identified by gene expression profiling studies of high-
grade gliomas that separated proneural, mesenchymal and
proliferative classes. The mesenchymal signature defined a
group with a relatively worse prognosis and relatively
enriched in recurrent tumors, with frequent up-regulation of
YKL40, CD44, and STAT3 [19]. Recent analysis of data
from lower-grade gliomas (II-III) also highlighted the
relevance of the glioblastoma molecular subtypes with
respect
the
mesenchymal subclass was almost entirely restricted to
glioblastomas in this study.

to biology and prognosis [20]. However,

Germline NF1 mutations may be of many different types,
including mutations altering splicing of mRNA, as well as
nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations [21,22].
Approximately 5% of NF1 patients have constitutional
large gene deletions, which may be associated with a more
severe phenotype [23,24]. Large constitutional deletions may
also have an effect on tumor burden in a subset of patients [25].

At the current moment it is unclear what the role of NF1
genetic alterations, particularly deletions and mutations with
predicted functional effects, is in the sporadic diffuse glioma
subtypes. In the current study, we tested for NF1 copy number
alterations in a cohort of diffuse gliomas, evaluated public
databases, and searched for associations with pathologic and
molecular features.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. The Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis

The cBIOPORTAL for cancer genomics website from
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (http://www.cbioportal.
org/public-portal) was used to analyze The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) data for NF1 alterations in diffuse gliomas (date of
analysis 8 December 2014). Copy number/genotype platforms
listed for the glioblastoma dataset are Affymetrix SNP6 and Agilent
224K/415K [26]. Data for homozygous deletions were obtained
through the GISTIC algorithm. To exclude non-relevant “passen-
ger” mutations or germline variants, we focused on mutations with
predicted functional consequences as specified in cBIOPORTAL
using previously published guidelines by Reva et al. [27]. In brief,
mutations are assigned a functional impact score based on the
extent of conservation of the specific amino acid residues across
and within species. “Medium” and “High” scores (N~1.9) are
predicted to be functional (ie, relevant to disease). Details of
cBIOPORTAL analysis have been previously published [28,29].
Frequencies were compared using the Fisher exact test. Survival
analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the

NF1 alterations in diffuse gliomas

log-rank test per the cBIOPORTAL algorithm. In addition,
available scanned hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides were
reviewed and IDH mutation status was abstracted in the subset of
lower-grade glioma cases with NF1 alterations in cBIOPORTAL.

2.2. Primary tumor samples

A cohort of 130 diffuse gliomas obtained from two tissue
microarrays constructed at Johns Hopkins Hospital were
studied, including 86 glioblastomas (57 adults, 29 pediatric)
and 44 lower-grade diffuse gliomas (grades II-III). Two to four
0.6 mm diameter cores per tumor were evaluated. Clinicopath-
ologic features of these cases have been previously published
[30]. All studies were performed under institutional review
board approval and following all guidelines.

2.3. Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical staining was performed in formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded tissue microarray sections using a
podoplanin antibody (clone D2-40, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA)
1:200). A biotin-free polymer detection kit was used (Bond
Polymer Refine Detection, Leica Microsystems, Bannock Burn,
IL). At least 2 TMA scores per case were required for score
assignment. Scoring was performed by 2 observers (M.A.V.,
F.J.R.) using a three-tiered scale based on staining intensity
(0-3+) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Non-neoplastic gray and white
matter were used as controls.

2.4. Fluorescence in situ hybridization

A custom-made fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
probe targeting the NF1 gene (17q11.2) with a CEP17 probe
control was obtained from Empire Genomics (Buffalo, NY), and
hybridized using previously described methods [31]. Sections
were evaluated using an Olympus PROVIS (Center Valley, PA)
fluorescence scope with appropriate filters. At
least 50
non-overlapping nuclei were evaluated per case. Heterozygous
deletion was defined as a target-to-control ratio of 0.80 or less.
Monosomy was defined as loss of target and control probe in at
least 60% of cells. Chromosome gain was defined as an extra
copy of target and control probe in at least 30% of cells. Scoring
and calls were made by an observer blinded as to the specific
pathology of the specimens (M.A.V.), and confirmed by a
second observer (F.J.R.).

3. Results

3.1. NF1 mutations and homozygous deletions in
glioblastomas and lower-grade gliomas in TCGA

We first looked at genomic data of diffuse gliomas from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the cBIOPORTAL

1325

for cancer genomics website from Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center (http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal) to
determine the frequency of NF1 genetic alterations in diffuse
gliomas of various grades (II-III). Genomic alterations
(mutations with predicted functional consequences and
homozygous deletions) were present in the NF1 gene in 30
(of 281) (11%) glioblastomas with sequencing and copy
number data (homozygous deletion in 5, truncating mutations
in 19, missense mutations with predicted functional effects in
4, in-frame heterozygous deletion in 1, and an additional single
case with a homozygous deletion and a truncating mutation). A
single case had a missense mutation with no predicted
functional effects. None of these tumors had IDH1 or IDH2
mutations. Survival analysis did not demonstrate any differ-
ences when comparing glioblastomas with or without NF1
alterations (Fig. 2A and B). In the lower-grade glioma group,
21 (of 286) (7%) cases with sequencing and copy number data
had inactivating alterations in the NF1 gene (homozygous
deletions in 3, truncating mutations in 15, missense mutations
with predicted functional effects in 3). A single case had a
missense mutation with no predicted functional effects.
Overall and disease-specific survival were worse in low-
er-grade gliomas with NF1 alterations compared to those
without (P = .0001) (Fig. 2C and D).

Histologically, this subgroup of lower-grade gliomas with
NF1 genetic loss included low-grade astrocytoma (WHO
grade II) (n = 10), low-grade oligodendroglioma (n = 2),
oligoastrocytomas (WHO grade II-III) (n = 7), anaplastic
astrocytoma (WHO grade III) (n = 1), and anaplastic
oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III) (n = 1) per ICD-O-3-
HISTOLOGY codes listed in cBIOPORTAL per case.
Permanent H&E slides were available for review in 8 cases
and confirmed a predominance of astrocytic histology,
including the only 2 oligoastrocytomas with available slides.
Of interest IDH1/2 mutations co-occurred in 8 (of 21) (38%)
of these tumors (IDH1 [R132H] in 7, IDH2 [R172K] in 1).
Three (of 5) of these patients with tumors with co-existing
NF1 and IDH1/2 mutations and follow up N1 year were
dead 22 to 46 months after diagnosis. FUBP1 and/or CIC
mutations, typical of oligodendrogliomas, were present in
only three (of 21) of these cases.

When looking at TCGA tumors with copy number alteration
data only, NF1 deletions were present
in (7/563 [1.2%])
glioblastomas compared to lower-grade gliomas (4/512 [0.7%]),
but this did not achieve statistical significance (P = .55, Fisher
exact test).

suitable for identification of tumor areas with genetic
alterations, even focally. In addition, this technique allows
for the identification of large, possibly more deleterious,
deletions. NF1/17q or Ch 17 gains/polysomies were relatively
common and identified in 40 (31%) of 130 cases across tumors
tested, including 2 of 11 diffuse astrocytomas, 6/16 anaplastic
astrocytomas, 7 of 17 oligodendroglial tumors, and 25 (29%)
of 86 glioblastomas (GBM) (8/29 pediatric GBM, 17/57 adult
GBM). Of greater functional interest, NF1/17q (n = 2) or
whole Ch17 (n = 3) losses were only identified in the GBM
group (6% [5/86]) (Fig. 3 and Table 1).

3.3. Clinicopathologic and molecular features of
glioblastomas with NF1 losses

When looking at the GBM subset with NF1/Ch17 loss in the
JHH cohort, the tumors were predominantly adult GBM (4/5).
Pathologic examination revealed that 2 of the 5 tumors were
gliosarcomas (Table 2). The diagnosis of gliosarcoma was
performed using current WHO criteria, specifically demonstrat-
ing distinct glial fibrillary acidic Protein (GFAP)-positive,

reticulin-poor glial neoplastic areas and GFAP-negative,
reticulin-rich sarcomatous areas [32]. Of the remaining 3, one
had small cell features, one was fibrillary, and one was
gemistocytic. Molecular and immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated that these tumors predominantly lacked EGFR
amplification (0/4), strong p53 immunolabeling (1/5), mutant
IDH1 (R132H) protein expression (0/5), or the alternative
lengthening of telomeres phenotype (1/5). Median overall
survival was 32 months (range, 10-118) (Tables 1 and 2).

Given the strong association between NF1 loss and the
mesenchymal phenotype in glioblastoma, we next tested the
samples with an antibody against podoplanin, which is in
broad clinical use and previously used as a marker of the
mesenchymal subtype in paraffin tissues [33]. Podoplanin
immunoreactivity when present was diffuse and varied
primarily in staining intensity, therefore the latter represented
the scoring parameter. Glioblastomas with NF1 loss expressed
podoplanin more frequently (4/5) than other diffuse gliomas
(45% [55/122]), although this was not statistically significant
(P = .18), likely related to the small number of cases of interest
(Fig. 4). Of note, almost all IDH1 (R132H) mutant tumors
(except for two) were podoplanin negative.

4. Discussion

The NF1 gene has emerged in recent years as an
important tumor suppressor gene in gliomas, not only in
those associated with the syndrome but also those that (more
commonly) develop sporadically. Previous analyses of the

TCGA dataset in glioblastoma uncovered a strong associa-
tion between somatic NF1 mutation and the mesenchymal
molecular subtype [18]. The mesenchymal subtype, as the
name suggests, was recognized initially by a gene expression
signature [19]. Subsequent work demonstrated that
this
phenotype is driven by a set of transcription factors (C/EBPβ
and STAT3), which are able to reprogram neural stem cells
along this phenotype [34]. Numerous markers have been
proposed as being useful in characterizing the mesenchymal
molecular subtype. We chose podoplanin in this study
because it is commercially available and routinely used in
many laboratories, and has been proposed by some groups as
a marker useful in proteomic subclassification of glioblas-
toma [33], although it has also been found to label reactive
glial cells in the context of gliomas and other pathologies
[35]. One caveat
is that glioblastoma and other diffuse
gliomas are increasingly recognized as demonstrating
genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, and the small areas
studied in TMAs may not be fully representative of the tumor
expression patterns.

In this study, we evaluated a cohort of diffuse gliomas for
copy number alterations involving the NF1 gene. Heterozy-
gous deletion of
the NF1 gene region/17q or whole
chromosomal loss (monosomy 17) was actually restricted
to a small subset of glioblastomas and were completely
absent in a group of diffuse gliomas of various types and
grades. Although these tumors have relatively distinct
molecular genetic features, the histology was variable. Of
interest, 2 of the cases with NF1/Ch17 loss were histolog-
ically gliosarcomas. Prior cytogenetic studies of gliosarcoma
have demonstrated a similar genetic profile to glioblastoma,
including 7,X,9q, and 20q gain, as well as 9p, Ch10, and 13q
loss [36,37], although 17q loss does not appear to be
particularly common.

Also of interest is that the survival of the patients with the
NF1-deleted group was not necessarily poor, although this
alteration was strictly limited to the glioblastoma group.

Despite the expression of podoplanin by 4 (of 5) of these
cases, the relatively long survival of some of these cases
raises the possibility that these tumors are not all of the
mesenchymal subtype. This subtype has been previously
associated with a high frequency of somatic NF1 loss,
although the alterations identifiable in the TCGA dataset
include point mutations and small deletions. It is unclear if
large deletions identifiable by FISH or whole chromosomal
loss has the same significance but may identify a distinct
subset of glioblastoma. Of interest, two of the tumors in our
dataset with NF1 loss were gliosarcomas, and the survival of
these 2 patients was shorter (10 and 21 months).

When looking at data from the TCGA, deletions
involving the NF1 gene were relatively rare, although
given the higher resolution of the platforms employed,
only homozygous deletions were studied. They were present
in both the glioblastoma and lower-grade glioma group.

in glioblastoma,

Although slightly more frequent
the
difference was not statistically significant. This contrasts
with the absence of NF1 genetic loss in our cohort of lower
grade diffuse gliomas using FISH. This discrepancy could be
explained in part by the fact
large NF1 deletions
identifiable by FISH reflect increased genomic instability in
higher grade gliomas, that is, glioblastoma, and that smaller
NF1 deletions present
in lower-grade gliomas require
platforms with higher resolution using frozen tissue, such
as those used by the TCGA.

that

A clinically important finding when looking at the TCGA
data is that NF1 loss (homozygous deletions or predicted
inactivating mutations) was associated with worse survival in
the lower-grade glioma group. Given the correlation of NF1
loss with the mesenchymal molecular subtype in glioblastoma,
it is possible that sporadic lower-grade gliomas with NF1 loss
represent a group more similar to primary glioblastoma than
other lower-grade gliomas. The predominant histologic type in
this group was diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II), which
suggests that histologic type (but probably not grade) may
account for some of these survival differences. In fact, only 3
pure oligodendrogliomas were present in this group, and CIC
and FUBP1 mutations, typical of oligodendrogliomas [38],
were absent
in the latter. Of interest, IDH1/2 mutations
occurred in approximately a third of these lower-grade gliomas
with NF1 loss, but not in glioblastomas, albeit at a lower
frequency than the lower-grade glioma group as a whole
(~80%). This suggests that the effects of NF1 loss on this
group cannot be ascribed completely to early glioblastomas, at
the pathologic or molecular level, but
it may have
additional prognostic implications. However, characterization
of the full clinical and biologic significance of NF1 genetic
loss in diffuse gliomas, and its cooperation with other genetic
alterations, will require further studies.

In summary, NF1/Ch17 gains occur in a subset of diffuse
irrespective of grade and pathologic subtype.
gliomas,
Conversely, NF1/Ch17 loss identifiable by FISH is restricted
to a small GBM subset, a finding that deserves further
exploration. In TCGA datasets NF1 alterations occur in both
GBM and lower-grade diffuse gliomas and may be
associated with worse outcome in the latter group, which
has prognostic implications.
