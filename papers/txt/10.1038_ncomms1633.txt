 Hereditary  haemorrhagic  telangiectasia  is  a  vascular  dysplasia  syndrome  caused  by 
mutations in transforming growth factor- β  / bone morphogenetic protein pathway genes,  ENG  
and  ACVRL1.  Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia shows considerable variation in clinical 
manifestations,  suggesting  environmental  and / or  genetic  modiﬁ er  effects.  Strain-speciﬁ c 
penetrance of the vascular phenotypes of  Eng       +     /     −       and  Tgfb1       −     /     −       mice provides further support 
for  genetic  modiﬁ cation  of  transforming  growth  factor- β   pathway  deﬁ cits.  We  previously 
identiﬁ ed variant genomic loci, including  Tgfbm2,  which suppress prenatal vascular lethality 
of   Tgfb1       −     /     −        mice.  Here  we  show  that  human  polymorphic  variants  of   PTPN14   within  the 
orthologous  TGFBM2  locus inﬂ uence clinical severity of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, 
as assessed by development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. We also show that 
 PTPN14 ,  ACVRL1  and  EFNB2,  encoding EphrinB2, show interdependent expression in primary 
arterial  endothelial  cells   in  vitro.   This  suggests  an  involvement  of  PTPN14  in  angiogenesis 
and / or  arteriovenous  fate,  acting   via   EphrinB2  and  ACVRL1 / activin  receptor-like  kinase  1. 
These ﬁ ndings contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular pathology of hereditary 
haemorrhagic telangiectasia in particular and to angiogenesis in general.

 The transforming growth factor (TGF)- β  signalling pathway 

is  critical  in  many  common  diseases,  including  fi brosis, 
cancer, cardiovascular and autoimmune disorders 1 . TGF- β  
and BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signalling pathways are 
also  disrupted  in  single  gene  disorders,  including  Loeys – Dietz 
syndrome 2 , thoracic ascending aortic dissections 3 , multiple self-
healing  squamous  epithelioma 4 ,  Marfan  syndrome 3 ,  juvenille 
polyposis  syndrome 5 ,  familial  pulmonary  hypertension 6   and 
hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) 7,8 , with a notable 
theme of the TGF- β  spectrum disorders being variable expressiv-
ity of clinical features 9 . 

 HHT is one of the most common monogenic diseases. It is auto-
somal dominant, aff ects at least 1 in 5,000 individuals worldwide 
and  is  under-reported  due  to  clinical  unfamiliarity  with  the  dis-
ease 7,8 . It is a multivisceral vascular disease with incomplete, age-
dependent  penetrance  of  clinical  features,  caused  predominantly 
by  mutations  in  the  genes   ENG   (HHT1)  or   ACVRL1   (HHT2). 
Th  e encoded proteins, endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 
(ALK1), respectively, are endothelial receptors involved in TGF- β  
superfamily signalling 10,11 . HHT patients typically present during 
adolescence with recurrent nosebleeds or epistaxis, and with cuta-
neous telangiectases, which are clusters of abnormally dilated ves-
sels caused by defective vascular remodelling and capillary break-
down 7,12 .  Th  ese  manifestations  are  highly  penetrant  (85 % )  but 
show  variable  expressivity 13 .  More  serious  visceral  complications 
of HHT are caused by larger arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) 
that  include  pulmonary  (PAVM),  hepatic  and  cerebral  AVMs,  as 
well as gastrointestinal bleeding from mucosal telangiectases that 
can cause severe anemia 14 . 

 Globally, PAVM is found in  ~ 50 %  of HHT patients and causes 
right-to-left  shunting, because the pulmonary capillary fi lter is com-
promised. Th  is allows clots to enter the systemic circulation, that can 
lead to frequent severe complications, oft en at a young age, includ-
ing stroke, transient ischaemic attack and brain abscess 15 . Massive 
haemoptysis and bleeding into the pleural cavity is less common. 
Screening for PAVMs is therefore recommended to HHT patients 
and their asymptomatic relatives. 

 Genotype – phenotype  correlation  studies  have  shown  that  the 
prevalence of PAVM is signifi cantly higher in HHT1 than in HHT2 
(refs  13,16 ). Th  ere are also diff erences in the prevalence of PAVM in 
HHT that are at least partially attributable to population-specifi c vari-
ations in the HHT1:HHT2 ratio 17 . In France and Italy, HHT2 is more 
common  than  HHT1,  with  consequent  lower  incidence  of  PAVM. 
In the Netherlands, HHT1 is the most common form 13 , and in the 
Dutch Antilles, all cases of HHT are HHT1 (ref.  18 ). Th  us, PAVM is of 
higher incidence in Dutch  versus  Franco – Italian populations. 
 Th  ere has been debate as to whether HHT is a disorder of TGF- β  
or  BMP  signalling.  Th  is  superfamily  contains  over  30  related 
ligands,  including  TGF- β s,  BMPs,  growth/diff erentiation  factors 
and activins. Th  e major ligand sub-classes possess distinct and spe-
cifi c type II serine – threonine receptor kinases, but type I receptor 
kinases  are  promiscuous,  can  hetero-oligomerize  with  a  variety 
of type II and I receptors, and are activated by a broader range of 
superfamily  ligands 1 .  TGF- β s  generally  signal   via   the  canonical 
T β RII,  T β RI,  Smad2 / Smad3 / Smad4  pathway  and  BMPs  through 
BMPR2, BMPR1A and / or BMPR1B  via  Smad1 / Smad5 / Smad8. 
 Biochemically, ALK1 was fi rst designated as a TGF- β  type 1 ser-
ine – threonine receptor kinase 19 , and endoglin as a type III TGF- β  
co-receptor 20 . However, endoglin can bind a variety of other super-
family ligands, including BMPs and activin 21 , and the ligand with 
highest affi  nity for ALK1 is BMP9 (ref.  22) , which triggers signalling 
 via  the canonical Smad1 / Smad5 / Smad8 pathway, therefore impli-
cating HHT as a  ‘ BMP disease ’ . Conversely, mouse genetics stud-
ies implicate functional interaction between the  bona fi da  TGF- β  
pathway and endoglin / ALK1. Specifi cally,  Acvrl1       −     /     −       and  Eng       −     /     −       
embryos  manifest  prenatal-lethal  vascular  phenotypes  similar 

to  those  of   Tgfb  r2       −     /     −       ,  Tgfb  r1       −     /     −        and   Tgfb  1       −     /     −      ,  namely  death 
between  9.5  to  11.5  days   post-coitum   due  to  vascular  dysgenesis, 
predominantly of the yolk sac but also within the embryo, in which 
vessels are dilated and leaky, with reduced investment of vessels by 
pericytes 23 – 26 .  Endothelial  targeting  of   Tgfb  r1   or   Tgfb  r2   knock-
out  recapitulates  these  vascular  phenotypes 27 .   Eng       −     /     −        embryos 
secrete reduced endothelial TGF- β 1 protein levels leading to lower 
p-Smad2 levels in adjacent mesothelial cells, suggesting that endo-
glin  regulates  TGF- β 1  production 28 .  In  contrast,   Bmp9       −     /     −        and 
 Bmp10       −     /     −       mice do not display lethal defects in yolk sac develop-
ment.  Bmp10       −     /     −       mice die later in development from defective car-
diac development 29 , and  Bmp9       −     /     −       animals are all viable at birth 
(J-K. Lee, personal communication). 

 Th  e situation is yet more complex since, even within a single cell, 
the ALK1 / Smad1 / 5 / 8 and ALK5 / Smad2 pathways can synergise or 
antagonize each other. It has been demonstrated that ALK1 directly 
antagonizes  ALK5-mediated  P-Smad2  signalling 30 .  Conversely, 
ALK5  is  required  for  ALK1 / Smad1 / 5 / 8 /   signalling  in  endothelial 
cells 30 , and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of endoglin by 
ALK5  can  regulate  ALK1 / Smad1 / 5 / 8  signalling 31 .  Th  erefore,  the 
most likely scenario is that HHT is caused by defects in the delicate 
balance  between  endoglin,  TGF- β  / ALK5 / ALK1  and  BMP / ALK1 
signalling within endothelial cells and their progenitors, with com-
plex  interactions  between  the  various  receptors  and  co-receptors 
that elicit incompletely characterized biological responses in both 
endothelia and adjacent pericyte cells 30 – 33 . 

 A feature of HHT is the large intra-familial range in disease sever-
ity, suggesting that, in addition to the causative  ENG  or  ACVRL1  
mutation,  independent  modifi er  genes  or  environmental  factors 
have a role in clinical severity 13,16 . Wounding or infl ammation may 
be  an  important  environmental  factor  precipitating  development 
of  telangiectases 34 .  Th  e  notion  that  HHT  is  infl uenced  by  modi-
fi er genes is supported by the observation that a mouse model of 
HHT1 shows strain diff erences in disease severity 35 . Identifi cation 
of genetic modifi ers may help in development of targeted therapies. 
We  followed  the  lead  that  diff erent mouse strains show  dramatic 
variation in penetrance of  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       prenatal lethality 36,37 . Previ-
ously, we mapped genetic modifi er loci,  Tgfb  m ’  s, that can suppress 
the  lethal  vascular  phenotype  of   Tgfb  1       −     /     −       ,   resulting  in  viable, 
developmentally normal pups 36 – 38 . Here we demonstrate that the 
human  PTPN14  gene ,  which is located in a region orthologous to 
mouse  Tgfb  m2  (ref.  37  ) , shows genetic association with the presence 
of PAVM in HHT patients. Moreover, we show that small interfering 
RNA (siRNA) knockdown of endogenous  PTPN14 , which encodes 
the  protein,  non-receptor  tyrosine  phosphatase  14  (PTPN14), 
modulates  angiogenesis  in  a  three-dimensional  (3D)  human  pri-
mary endothelial culture system. PTPN14 also supports endothelial 
expression of EphrinB2, a key molecule required for angiogenesis 39 , 
establishment of endothelial arteriovenous identity 40  and recruit-
ment  of  pericytes / smooth  muscle  cells  during  blood  vessel  wall 
assembly 41 .  

 Results  
  Validation of  Tgfb  m2   129   using C57 congenic mice   .   Previously we 
showed that C57 mice that are homozygous null for the  Tgfb  1   tm1N   
allele (henceforth termed  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       mice) all die prenatally from 
vascular  dysgenesis 37 .  However,  on  other  mouse  strains,  namely 
NIH or 129, a variable fraction of  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       pups are viable and 
developmentally  normal  at  birth,  suggesting  the  existence  of 
genetic modifi ers that can suppress the  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       prenatal vascular 
phenotype 37,38 . By classical genetic linkage analysis of a C57  ×  129 
F1 intercross, we mapped a strong 129 suppressor of C57. Tgfb  1       −     /     −       
pre-natal lethality to distal mouse chromosome 1, termed  Tgfb  m2   129 
 (ref. 37) . In order to validate  Tgfb  m2   129   as a modifi er of  Tgfb  1       −     /     −      , 
we  herein  generated  a  C57. Tgfb  m2   129 / 129    congenic 
line  by 
backcrossing F1. C57  × 129.  Tgfb  1       +     /     −       mice through >10 generations

        Figure 1    |         Fine mapping and functional validation of  Tgfbm2  in congenic 
mice. ( a ) F1.C57 / 129. Tgfb1       +     /     −       mice were backcrossed >10 generations 
into inbred C57, at each generation selecting for both the  Tgfb1   tm1N   allele 
and  D1Mit362   129  , using genetic markers. When mice were >99.9 %  C57, 
except for a 26   Mb 129 interval at the telomeric end of chromosome 1, 
littermates were used to generate C57.  Tgfb1       +     /     −       congenics that 
were either homozygous C57 ( Tgfbm2   C57 /  C57 ) or homozygous 129 
( Tgfbm2   129 / 129  ) at  Tgfbm2 .  Tgfb1       +     /     −       intercrosses within the indicated 
mouse strains were assayed for viable  Tgfb1       −     /     −       pups as a percentage 
of wild-type neonates. Whereas  Tgfb1       −     /     −       mice on a C57 ( n     >    400) or 
congenic C57. Tgfbm2   C57 / C57   ( n     =    84) background always die  in utero  from 
vascular dysgenesis,  Tgfbm2   129 / 129   ( n     =    139) rescued C57. Tgfb1       −     /     −       mice 
from invariable prenatal lethality ( P    =    0.02 ;   χ   2  test ), almost to the extent 
observed on a pure 129 genetic background ( n >100, and see earlier 
publication  37 ). ( b )  Tgfb1       +     /     −       mice backcrossed >20 generations to NIH 
selecting only for the  Tgfb1   tm1N   allele were unexpectedly found to harbour 
129 genomic variants at  Tgfbm2.  These mice were segregated by  Tgfbm2  
genotype and assayed for frequency of viable  Tgfb1       −     /     −       pups born on a 
NIH. Tgfbm2   129 / 129   background, compared with that on a NIH. Tgfbm2    NIH / NIH   
background. A similar comparative intercross analysis was undertaken on 
a panel of NIH. Tgfbm3    C57 / C57   mice (lines 3, 4, 6 and 8;  n >100 mice for each 
genotype) that are sensitized to  Tgfb1       −     /     −       prenatal lethality 38 , showing a 
statistically signiﬁ cant association between pup viability and  Tgfbm2   129 / 129   
( P     =    0.0002; logistic regression). All data in ( b ) are normalized relative 
to pup viability of the partner mouse strain homozygous for the NIH 
allele of  Tgfbm2   NIH / NIH   (light grey bars). Dark grey bar shows data for 
NIH mice heterozygous for  Tgfbm2   129 / NIH  . Black bars show data for mice

onto  a  C57  genetic  background,  using  simple  sequence  repeat 
(SSR)  marker-assisted  breeding  to  select  the   Tgfb  m2   129    allele  at

harbouring  26   Mb  of  129  genomic  DNA  around   Tgfb  m2   were 
generated and found to rescue C57. Tgfb  1       −     /     −       embryos from invariable 
prenatal lethality ( Fig. 1a ), providing validation for the existence of 
 Tgfb  m2   129   as a suppressor of  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       embryo lethality.

 Tgfb  1       +     /     −       mice onto another mouse strain, namely NIH / OlaHsd 
(NIH), and selecting only for the  Tgfb  1   tm1N   allele at each genera-
tion ( ≥ 20 generations), we found that some NIH. Tgfb  1       +     /     −       stock 
mice possessed SSR markers characteristic of 129 genomic DNA 
on distal chromosome 1. Fine mapping delineated this 129 region 
to  ~ 1   Mb around  D1Mit362 , that had previously been identifi ed as 
the peak of  Tgfb  m2  by genetic linkage analysis 37  ( Supplementary 
Data 1 ). We designated this 1-Mb interval as the  Tgfb  m2   129   mini-
mal region, and suggest that there had been biological selection 
for preferential inheritance of this region, driven by co-selection 
with the  Tgfb  1   tm1N   allele.

embryos,  we  segregated  NIH. Tgfb  1       +     /     −        mice  according  to  the 
genotype  of   Tgfb  m2 ,  that  is,   Tgfb  m2   129 / 129   ,  Tgfb  m2   129 / NIH    or 
 Tgfb  m2   NIH / NIH  , and tested for  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       prenatal loss. Th  e viability 
of NIH. Tgfb  1       −     /     −       pups was enhanced somewhat by heterozygos-
ity for  Tgfb  m2   129 / NIH  , and to a greater extent by homozygosity at 
 Tgfb  m2   129 / 129   ( Fig. 1b ). However, due to the already high develop-
mental viability of  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       mice when on a NIH background, this 
increase was not statistically signifi cant. We therefore sensitized the 
NIH mice to  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       prenatal loss by breeding in another modi-
fi er  locus,   Tgfb  m3   C57  ,  that  we  previously  reported  to  accentuate 
 Tgfb  1       −     /     −       prenatal loss 38 . Sensitized NIH. Tgfb  m3   C57 / C57   congenic 
lines, 3, 4, 6 and 8 ( Fig. 1b ), which each harbour diff erent intervals 
of C57 genomic DNA at  Tgfb  m3  (K.K.K. and R.J.A. unpublished 
mouse strains) ,  were bred into NIH. Tgfb  m2   129 / 129   mice. Th  ese were 
intercrossed  to  re-generate  homozygosity  at  NIH. Tgfb  m3   C57 / C57   
and segregated by  Tgfb  m2  genotype into either  Tgfb  m2   129 / 129   or 
 Tgfb  m2   NIH / NIH  . Importantly, homozygosity for  Tgfb  m2   129 / 129   sup-
pressed  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       prenatal lethality in every line, showing statistical 
signifi cance when assessed by logistic regression analysis ( Fig. 1b ; 
odds ratio    =    2.03; confi dence interval    =    1.41 – 3.03,  P    =     0.0002; logis-
tic  regression).  Th  e  1-Mb   Tgfb  m2   129    minimal  interval  therefore 
harbours  a   Tgfb  1       −     /     −        suppressor  eff ect,  giving  credence  to  the 
notion that inheritance of  Tgfb  m2  129  on the NIH background was 
driven  by  biological  co-selection  with  the   Tgfb  1   tm1N    allele.  Fine 
genetic  mapping  by  SSR,  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP) 
and sequence analysis refi ned the map location of the  Tgfb  m2  min-
imal region and excluded the nearby  Tgfb  2  gene ( Fig. 2a ), which 
might  otherwise  be  considered  an  obvious  candidate  to  modify 
 Tgfb  1  function. 

 Fine  mapping  analysis  across  the  minimal   Tgfb  m2   129    region 
revealed two major haplotype blocks that were identical to 129S2SV /
 Hsd, the 129 sub-strain used in our laboratory. However, there were 
also two additional haplotype blocks distinct from 129S2SV / Hsd, 
despite  the  fact  that  they  share  more  similarity  to  129S2SV / Hsd 
than either C57 or NIH. We termed these haplotypes  ‘ variant 129 ’  
in  Fig. 2a  and  Supplementary Data 1 . Th  eir existence suggests that

   Figure 3    |         SNPs within  PTPN14  show genetic association with presence 
of PAVM in Dutch HHT patients. ( a ) A total of 534 gene-centric SNPs 
tagging the ﬁ ve syntenic genes of  TGFBM2  at 1q41 , plus 72 TGF β  / BMP 
signalling  ‘ candidate genes ’ , were screened in 721 HHT patients and family 
members. Graph shows the distribution of   – log   10   (P)  values resulting from 
GC analysis of genetic association to PAVM in pooled HHT1 and HHT2.

  To further validate the genetic association to PAVM, we analysed 
the Dutch HHT1 and HHT2 families independently.  rs2936017  and 
 rs2936018 ,  located  within   PTPN14 ,  were  the  only  SNPs  to  show 
nominal evidence of over-transmission to PAVM    +     in both HHT1 
( P     =    0.01  and   P     <    0.01 ,   respectively,  GC  test,   Table  2 )  and  HHT2 
( P     <    0.01 and  P     =    0.001, respectively, GC test,  Table 2 ), demonstrat-
ing replication of genetic association in two unrelated HHT patient 
populations, with causative mutations in two diff erent genes.

the  Tgfb  m2   129   minimal DNA may have derived from another 129 
sub-strain  that  had  been  bred  into  the  colony  earlier  during  the 
propagation of the  Tgfb  1   tm1N   allele 42 .   

   TGFBM2  associates with the presence of PAVM in Dutch HHT   . 
  As homozygous mouse gene knockouts of the causative genes for 
HHT,  Eng  and  Acvrl1,  phenocopy the vascular dysgenesis seen in 
 Tgfb  1       −     /     −        embryos 25,26,40 ,  and  because   Tgfb  m2   suppresses  this 
phenotype ( Fig. 1a,b ), we investigated SNPs within human ortho-
logues of the  Tgfb  m2  genes for genetic association to HHT clinical 
severity. We initially investigated 721 individuals from 137 diff erent 
families who had been molecularly screened for the causative HHT 
mutation and clinically screened for the presence of PAVMs as a 
parameter of severity 13 . 

 Th  e  human  genome  at  1q41  shows  synteny  with  mouse  over 
the   Tgfb  m2   minimal  region  ( Fig.  2b ) ,   and  gene-centric  tag-SNPs 
( n     =    76) covering the fi ve orthologous  Tgfb  m2  genes were selected ,  
together  with  tag-SNPs  ( n     =    15)  covering   SMYD2   and   TGFB2,  
which are located 20   Kb proximal and 1.9   Mb distal to  TGFBM2,  
respectively ( Fig. 2b ) .  Additionally, 443 tag-SNPs were included that 
covered 72  ‘ candidate genes ’  selected on the basis of involvement in 
TGF- β  signalling or responses, and located all around the genome 
( Supplementary Data 2 ). 

 Th  e  fi rst  screen  included  649  Dutch  individuals  of  northern 
European descent and 72 Afro – Caribbean individuals from the 
Dutch Antilles ( Table 1  and  Supplementary Table S1 ). We used 
a  modifi cation  of  the  transmission  disequilibrium  test  (TDT), 
namely Gamete Competition (GC) 43 , to screen for genetic associ-
ation with the presence  versus  absence of PAVM in HHT mutation 
carriers. GC was selected over TDT because of the large, multi-
generational structure of families within this cohort ( Supplemen-
tary  Table  S2  and  S3 ).  A  total  of  29  of  the  534  SNPs  screened 
showed nominal evidence of over-transmission to PAVM    +     HHT 
patients  ( P     <    0.05,  GC  test)  ( Fig.  3a )  and  were  genotyped  in  an 
additional 108 northern European Dutch individuals. Although 
this  smaller  data  set  was  not  signifi cant  alone,  when  pooled 
with  the  fi rst  data  set,  4  of  the  29  SNPs  showed  improvements 
in  P -value in excess of one order of magnitude, all were within 
 TGFBM2,  three within the gene  PTPN14  ( rs2936018, P     =    3 × 10     −    5 ; 
 rs2936017 ,  P     =    2 × 10     −    4 ;  rs3002300 ,  P     =    2 × 10     −    4 ; GC test) and one 
1.7   Mb distal to  PTPN14,  within  USH2A  ( rs700024, P     =    1.6 × 10     −    3 ; 
GC test) ( Fig. 3b ,  Table 2 ). 

 To validate the GC result, we broke up large HHT family struc-
tures into nuclear families and ran TDT in 19 informative family 
trios.  Both   rs2936018   and   rs2936017   within   PTPN14   showed 
signifi cant over-transmission of the minor allele to PAVM    +     HHT 
individuals ( P     =    8 × 10     −    3 ; TDT). Only one other SNP,  rs700024 , was 
similarly found to be associated with PAVM by TDT ( P     =    9 × 10     −    3 ; 
TDT) ( Figs 2b, 3b ).

   PTPN14   genetic  association  is  not  due  to  linked   TGFB2   gene   . 
   PTPN14   SNP   rs2936018   ( P     =    3 × 10     −    5 )  and   USH2A   SNP   rs700024  
( P     =    1.6 × 10     −    3 ) are 2.8   MB and 1.9   Mb, respectively, from the 5 ′  end 
of the  TGFB2  gene ( Fig. 2b ). As variant  TGFB2  is a logical biological 
candidate for modulating TGF- β 1 action and, as one SNP in  TGFB2 
(rs1891467 ) showed nominal evidence of association with PAVM 
in the preliminary HHT screen ( P     =    5.5 × 10     −    3 ;  Table 2 ), we tested 
linkage disequilibrium (LD) between  TGFB2  and the  rs700024  hap-
lotype block. We also tested whether families that contributed to the 
nominal  TGFB2  association were the same as those contributing to 
the  USH2A  and  PTPN14  associations. Th  ere was no LD between 
these haplotype blocks ( r   2      <    0.2). Moreover, the families contribut-
ing most strongly to  TGFB2  association were diff erent from those 
contributing  to  association  with   PTPN14   or   USH2A,   suggesting 
that genetic association with  rs2936017, rs2936018  or  rs700024  is 
not driven by genetic linkage to  TGFB2 .   

   PTPN14  association to PAVM validated in French HHT2   .   Th  e 29 
nominally associated SNPs from the initial Dutch screen were sub-
sequently genotyped in an independent French replication cohort 

of  222  individuals,  all  with  HHT  (mostly  HHT2;   n     =    146)  and 
screened for PAVM 16 . Th  e relatively small number of HHT1 patients 
in the French population ( n     =    76) prevented an independent analysis 
of genetic association in this specifi c monogenic disorder. However, 
the French HHT2 population was suffi  ciently large for independent 
analysis. Of the 29 SNPs tested, only 3 SNPs showed nominal evi-
dence of genetic association to PAVM    +     in French HHT2 ( P     <    0.05, 
GC test), precisely those  PTPN14  SNPs most strongly associated in 
Dutch HHT1 and HHT2 ( Table 3 ).   

   siPTPN14  enhances angiogenesis in 3D EC culture   .   Very little is 
known about the action of PTPN14 in vascular endothelial cells, 
although this protein is expressed at high levels in human umbilical 
vein endothelial cells 44 , as well as human umbilical artery endothe-
lial cells (HUAECs) and HMEC-1 microvascular endothelial cells 
( Fig.  4a ).  Th  e  strong  genetic  association  of   PTPN14   with  PAVM 
in HHT led us to investigate a possible function for this protein in 
endothelial cell biology. As HHT has been suggested to be a disease 
of excessive angiogenesis 45 – 47 , we chose to use an  in vitro  angiogen-
esis assay. We fi rst optimized knockdown of PTPN14 protein levels

     Figure 4    |          siPTPN14  stimulates  in vitro  angiogenesis. si-RNA KD of  PTPN14  was optimized in HMEC-1 cells ( a ) and HUAECs (not shown) by western 
analysis. ( b , c ) siRNA-treated HUAECs were cultured for 6 days in a 3D  in vitro  angiogenesis assay. ( b ) Phase contrast micrographs of  siControl  or

using  siPTPN14  ( Fig. 4a ). Th  en, without a preconceived model as 
to the mode of action of the causative  PTPN14  genetic variant(s), 
we investigated the eff ect of siRNA knockdown of  PTPN14  in a 3D 
 in vitro  angiogenesis assay ( Fig. 4b ). Interestingly,  siPTPN14  mode-
rately, but signifi cantly, enhanced angiogenic sprouting of primary 
HUAECs, as well as signifi cantly increasing the numbers of endothe-
lial tip cells ( Fig. 4b,c ), giving credence to the notion that PTPN14 
is innately involved in the regulation of endothelial angiogenesis, as 
least in this  in vitro  system.   

  ALK1  and  EphrinB2  show  interdependent  expression  with 
PTPN14   .    It  has  been  suggested  that  HHT  pathology  might  be 
attributed to excess angiogenesis, as some patients respond favour-
ably to treatment with the VEGF inhibitor, bevacizumab 45,46 , and 
to  the  angiogenesis  inhibitor,  thalidomide 47 .  A  defect  in  specifi -
cation of arteriovenous identity has also been implicated as both 
 Eng       −     /     −       and  Acvrl1       −     /     −       embryos show loss of arterial identity at the 
expense of expansion of venous vessels 40,48,49 . Moreover,  Acvrl1       −     /     −       
embryos  fail  to  upregulate   Efnb2,   which  encodes  EphrinB2,  a 
guidance molecule known to be pivotal in tip cell-mediated angio-
genesis 50,51   and  best  known  as  a  marker  and  eff ector  of  arterial 
 versus   venous  endothelial  cell  specifi cation 39,50,51 .  Th  is  depend-
ence  of   EFNB2 /  EphrinB2  expression  on   ACVRL1   has  also  been 
observed in cultured HUAECs (J-H.K, M.R.P., S.C.G. and C.C.W.H. 
unpublished observations) ( Fig. 5a,b ). Interestingly, we found that 
 siPTPN14   knockdown  in  cultured  HUAECs  also  resulted  in  a 
dramatic  reduction  in   EFNB2 /  EphrinB2  expression  at  both  RNA 
( Fig.  5c )  and  protein  levels  ( Fig.  5d ).  Conversely,  knockdown  of 
 EFNB2  or  ACVRL1  signifi cantly elevated  PTPN14  gene expression 
( Fig. 5e ) and protein levels ( Fig. 5f ), demonstrating interdependence 
for expression between these three genes ( Fig. 5g ). Th  us,  PTPN14  
may interact with  ACVRL1  and  EFNB2,  directly or indirectly, to regu-
late angiogenesis and / or arteriovenous specifi cation, both processes 
that are implicated as abnormal in the pathology of HHT 40,45,48,52 .    

 Discussion 
 Here, we validated the action of  Tgfb  m2   129   as a suppressor of pre-
natal vascular lethality of  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       mice on two diff erent genetic 
backgrounds,  NIH  and  C57.  Intriguingly,  we  discovered  a  1-Mb 
interval of 129-like genomic DNA spanning the  Tgfb  m2  locus in our 
NIH. Tgfb  1       +     /     −       mouse stock that had unintentionally been selected 
in our breeding protocol. Th  e ability of this minimal  Tgfb  m2   129   inter-
val to suppress the lethal vascular dysplasia of  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       embryos 
suggests that this genomic element had been selectively inherited 
through  multiple  generations,  driven  by  co-selection  with  the 
 Tgfb  1   tm1N    allele.  Interestingly,  although  the  minimal   Tgfb  m2   129   
interval shared two extensive haplotype blocks with the 129 sub-strain 
that we have used in our lab for many years, around half of the 1-Mb 
interval was genetically distinct from all mouse lines in our animal 
unit.  It  is  therefore  probable  that  this  minimal   Tgfb  m2   129    region 
derived  from  a  related  129  sub-strain  onto  which  the   Tgfb  1   tm1N   
allele was initially bred 42  before our genetic studies. Th  is minimal 
 Tgfb  m2   129    interval  might  even  lead  back  to  the  129  embryonic 
stem cells on which the original  Tgfb  1   tm1N   allele was generated 42 , 
although we have been unable to validate this thesis. 

 Suppressor screens utilizing sensitized genetic stock have for years 
been used in lower organisms, such as  Drosophila  and  Caenorhabditis 
elegans    ,  to identify genes that interact on specifi c signalling pathways. 
Our current report is the fi rst evidence of such a mechanism occur-
ring naturally in mice without experimental mutagenesis. Importantly, 
hundreds of genetically engineered mouse models are now available. 
Many have been bred into diff erent inbred genetic backgrounds over 
several years. Genome-wide screens for unlinked genetic variants that 
are co-inherited with a recombinant genetic locus could be generally 
applied to identify novel genes and mechanisms involved in signalling 
and developmental pathways  in vivo , as well as genetic interactions 
that contribute to human disease susceptibility. 

 In a previous study, it was shown that breeding the  Eng       +     /     −       mouse 
onto a 129 / Ola genetic background potentiated the appearance of

vascular lesions in adult mice, whereas the C57 strain was resist-
ant 35 . Th  is might appear incongruent with our observation of sup-
pression of  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       embryo lethality by the 129 allele of  Tgfb  m2 , 
but  there  are  several  possible  explanations  for  this  discrepancy. 
First, 129 / Ola is distinct from the 129 sub-strain used in the cur-
rent study. Second, genetic modifi er interactions are complex and, 
within an individual mouse strain, diff erent modifi er loci may have 
negative or positive eff ects on the trait in question. Furthermore, 
distinct  modifi ers  can  have  synergistic  or  antagonistic  eff ects  on 
each other. Nevertheless, the identifi cation of natural genetic vari-
ants that have such profound eff ects on  in vivo  pathology provides 
insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease. 

 Most importantly, we showed that  PTPN14  within the ortholo-
gous human  TGFBM2  locus showed the strongest genetic associa-
tion to PAVM in HHT. Th  is was despite screening over 500 SNPs, 
>450 of which informed on 72 other genes selected as candidate 
modifi ers on the basis of being components of the TGF- β  and BMP 
signalling or response pathways .  Genetic association of  PTPN14  to 
PAVM was then validated in two independent HHT diseases, HHT1 
and HHT2, and in two independent populations, Dutch and French 
HHT, providing robust evidence that variants in this gene alter risk 
for PAVM in HHT patients. Th  is fi nding is of signifi cant clinical 
relevance in elucidating the molecular pathology of PAVM. 

 We  then  demonstrated  that  knockdown  of  the  endogenous 
 PTPN14  gene in cultures of primary human endothelial cells modu-
lates angiogenesis in a 3D culture assay and alters the expression 
of EphrinB2 ,  a well characterized regulator of angiogenesis 50,51  and 
arteriovenous specifi cation 39 , suggesting an involvement of PTPN14 
in these processes, and lending further support to the notion that 
HHT is a disease of angiogenesis and arteriovenous specifi cation. 
Th  e route from a genetic modifi er of  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       phenotype to identi-
fi cation of a genetic risk factor for PAVM in HHT provides support 
to the notion of TGF- β 1 involvement in the pathology of PAVM in 
HHT, whether primary or secondary. It does not, however, rule out 
a role for BMP9 and BMP10, but is supportive of an imbalance in 
signalling between these two TGF- β  superfamily pathways. 

 Little  is  known  about  non-receptor  tyrosine  phosphatase  14 
(PTPN14)  function.  It  is  expressed  at  high  levels  in  endothelial 

cells 44 , and it was recently found to be mutated in a single family 
with  a  rare  case  of  recessive  human  lymphedema-choanal  atresia 
syndrome 53 .  Preliminary  studies  have  suggested  a  direct  interac-
tion between PTPN14 and VEGF-R3 that regulates signalling from 
VEGF-C 53 . As VEGF-R3 has been shown to be important in angio-
genesis 54 , as well as lymphangiogenesis, this would support a role for 
PTPN14 in determining HHT disease severity. Nevertheless, there is 
still much to be investigated concerning the mechanisms of action of 
PTPN14, and there are seemingly contradictory reports on its func-
tion in the literature. Th  is protein has alternatively been reported 
as an inactive phosphatase 55  or as actively involved in dephosphor-
ylation of  β -catenin 56 . It has also been shown to both stabilize and 
destabilize adherens junctions 56,57 , and to aff ect TGF β 1 secretion 57 . 
Th  e possession of a FERM domain and potential SH3 domain may 
suggest a role for PTPN14 as an adaptor protein in signal transduc-
tion. Future studies will include analysis of the protein partners that 
interact physically with PTPN14 not only in endothelial cells, but 
also  in  pericytes  and  smooth  muscle  cells,  which  are  secondarily 
impacted in HHT pathology. Further analysis of the nature and dif-
ferential activity of human PTPN14 variants would be informative 
as to protein function and altered molecular interactions that may 
suggest novel routes to medical intervention. 

 In conclusion, the identifi cation of  PTPN14  as a genetic modi-
fi er  of  PAVM  in  HHT  provides  novel  insight  into  the  molecular 
circuitry operating in vascular cells of HHT patients. Th  is fi nding 
will contribute to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms 
underlying PAVM formation that might ultimately be used in drug 
development for HHT or other disorders of angiogenesis.   

 Methods  
  Mouse studies   .   All animal experiments were undertaken at UCSF, and were in 
full compliance with the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(Protocol AN085727), which is AAALAC accredited. Mice were housed in a SPF 
facility in individually ventilated microisolator caging with paper chip bedding and 
unlimited access to  lab diet irradiated feed  ( Lab Products  ™ ) and water. Housing 
temperature was maintained between 20 and 22    ° C, and lighting adjusted to a 12-h 
light – dark cycle with 30 – 70 %  humidity. Mice were handled only in sterile BSL2 
laminar fl ow hoods. Th  ey were housed as breeding trios (1    , 2   ) until pups were 
3 weeks of age, and then at a maximum of fi ve same sex animals per cage. Both

genders of animal were used for study, and no sex diff erences were observed. Th  e 
 Tgfb  1   tm1N   allele (also termed  Tgfb  1 -) 42  was bred onto three diff erent genetic back-
grounds by repeated backcross (>10 generations) to inbred C57BL / 6NTac (C57), 
NIH / OlaHsd (NIH) or 129S2 / SvHsd (129).   

  Human subjects   .   Dutch Caucasians and Dutch Antillean Blacks were selected 
from a panel consisting of probands and family members screened for HHT. All 
manifestations of HHT were recorded for both probands and family members. 
Th  e clinical diagnosis of HHT was established according to the Cura ç ao criteria 7,8 , 
which are clinical features of epistaxis, multiple telangiectases, visceral AVM and a 
fi rst-degree relative with HHT. A diagnosis of HHT is considered defi nitive if three 
criteria are present, possible if two criteria are present and unlikely if fewer than 
two criteria are present. Mutation carrier status was confi rmed by molecular 
analysis. Most probands and family members were screened for visceral manifesta-
tions at St Antonius Hospital, which specializes in the diagnosis and treatment 
of HHT. In most cases, screening for the presence of a PAVM was performed 
routinely by chest radiography and by measuring partial oxygen tension in 
arterial blood and, if abnormal, followed by the 100 %  oxygen right-to-left  shunt 
test. Patients with a suspected PAVM were off ered conventional angiography, 
digital subtraction angiography of the pulmonary arteries or computed 
tomography (CT) of the chest. In some patients, PAVMs were diagnosed using 
high-resolution CT and / or contrast trans-thoracic echocardiography. 

 French HHT clinical diagnosis was also established according to the Cura ç ao 

criteria 17 . Mutation carrier status was confi rmed by molecular diagnosis 
(heteroduplex analysis or denaturing high performance liquid chromotography 
and sequencing). Screening for PAVMs was recommended to asymptomatic 
patients and accepted by a majority of them (66.8 % ) 16 . Th  e diagnosis of pulmonary 
involvement was made either in patients presenting symptoms (for example, 
dyspnoea and cyanosis) or complications (mainly brain abscess), or in asymp-
tomatic HHT patients who underwent screening using contrast trans-thoracic 
echocardiography, chest radiograph and / or oxygen shunt test as described. Th  e 
222 French patients included in the present study all carried a mutation in either 
 ENG  or  ACVRL1 , and 43 %  of them had a PAVM (74 %  for HHT1 patients and 27 %  
for HHT2 patients). Familial structures included 111 singletons, 40 duos, 2 trios, 
5 quartets and 1 family with 5 individuals. Study protocols were approved by local 
ethics committees at all institutions, and informed consent was obtained from each 
subject before participation in the studies.   

  Human SNP selection   .   Gene-centric tag-SNPs within and fl anking  TGFBM2  at 
1q41, and within and fl anking candidate genes, were utilized. SNPs were chosen 
on the basis of being non-synonymous coding polymorphisms, potential splice site 
variants or inferred to disrupt important gene regulatory sites (that is, microRNAs 
and transcription factor binding sites, and so on) using the UCSC genome server. 
We further looked for SNPs located in highly conserved regions in the 3 ′  UTR. 
Th  is fi rst set of SNPs was complemented by tag-SNPs using a tag approach with the 
HapMap phase II database ( http://www.hapmap.org ) by  ‘ force including ’  the fi rst 
set of variants using the Haploview Tagger and by searching for additional 
tag-SNPs. Selected SNPs were estimated to give  ~ 85 %  coverage of any chosen gene.   

  Human genotyping and quality control   .   Initial genotyping of the Dutch cohort 
was performed using 750-ng labelled genomic DNA hybridized to a custom 
Illumina chip. Genotyping for the extension and replication studies, and for fi ne 
mapping, was performed using  Sequenom   MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry . 
No signifi cant diff erence in call rates between cases and controls was seen. Samples 
successfully genotyped in     <    95 %  of markers were excluded from analysis. Markers 
were excluded if they deviated signifi cantly from Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium 
( P     <    0.05, Hardy – Weinberg) or if they had a call rate     <    95 %  in the entire cohort.   

   In vitro  angiogenesis assay   .   Th  e  in vitro  model was performed as described 
pre viously 58 . Briefl y,  primary human umbilical artery endothelial cells  ( HUAECs ) 
from  Lonza  were coated onto  Cytodex3 beads  ( Sigma-Aldrich Co ., 200 cells per 
bead, 250 beads per well) and cultured in fi brin gels in  EGM2 medium  ( Invitrogen ). 
Normal human lung fi broblasts were plated on top of the gel. Aft er 6 – 8 days, beads 
were photographed and the sprouts whose lengths were greater than the diameter 
of the bead were counted under an  Olympus   IX70 inverted phase contrast 
microscope . At least three wells were assayed for each sample, and a minimum of 
25 beads per well were counted. Before coating onto beads, the ECs were loaded 
with siRNA (13   pmole per 6-well plate) using  Lipofectamine 2000  ( Invitrogen ).   

  siRNA transient transfection and analysis   .    ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool 
siRNA oligonucleotides  specifi c for  PTPN14  were obtained from  Dharmacon  
(J-008509-05, 5 ′ -GAAGACAAGCGGUAAUAUA-3 ′ ; J-008509, 5 ′ -CATAACAA
GUCGACCAUUC-3 ′ ; J-008509-07, 5 ′ -GCUAAUGAGCCUUUGCUUU-3 ′ ; 
J-008509-08, 5 ′ -GGUGAGCACUACUCGGAAA-3 ′ ).   ACVRL1   (5 ′ -GGAUCAAG
AAGACACUACATT-3 ′ ) and   EFNB2   (5 ′ -GACAAGGACUGGUACUAUATT-3 ′ ) 
 siRNAs  were obtained from  Ambion . HUAECs, grown in  M199 media  ( Invitro-
gen ), were transiently transfected with each siRNA (13   pmole per 6-well plate) 
or their corresponding scrambled siRNA controls using  Lipofectamine 2000  
( Invitrogen ). At 48   h aft er transfection, gene and protein expression were analysed 
by quantitative reverse transcription – PCR and / or western blot.   

  Quantitative reverse transcription – PCR   .   Total RNA was isolated from the cells 
with  RNeasy Plus Mini Kit  ( Qiagen ). 1    μ g RNA was used for fi rst strand cDNA 
synthesis with  iScript cDNA Synthesis kit  ( Bio-Rad ). Primer sequences for  EFNB2  
(GenBank accession number, NM_004093) were 5 ′ -TTCGACAACAAGTCCC
TTTG-3 ′  (sense) and 5 ′ -GATGTTGTTCCCCGAATGTC-3 ′  (antisense); for 
 ACVRL1  (GenBank accession number, NM_000020) were 5 ′ -TTGGGCACCAC
ATCATAGAA-3 ′  (sense) and 5 ′ -GACTGACATCTGGGCCTTTG-3 ′  (antisense); 
for  PTPN14  (GenBank accession number, NM_005401) were 5 ′ -CAGGGAGTG
AATGTGATTC-3 ′  (sense) and 5 ′ -CAGTATCGGTGGCTTTTGGT-3 ′  (antisense) 
and for  GAPDH  (GenBank accession number, NM_002046.3) were 5 ′ -AATCCC
ATCACCATCTTCCA-3 ′  (sense) and 5 ′ -TGGACTCCACGACGTACTCA-3 ′  
(antisense). All primer pairs crossed intron – exon boundaries, thereby avoiding 
background contamination from genomic DNA. PCR was performed using an 
 IQ5 real time PCR system  ( Bio-Rad ) with SYBR green quantifi cation. Gene 
expression was normalized to  GAPDH  expression levels.   

  Western blot analysis   .   Cells were lysed on tissue culture plates using ice-cold 
RIPA buff er (50-mM Tris – HCL, pH 7.4, 150-mM sodium chloride, 1 %  NP40 and 
0.1 %  SDS) supplemented with  protease inhibitor cocktail tablets  ( Roche ). Samples 
were run on 4 – 12 or 3 – 8 %  SDS – PAGE and transferred to an  Immobilon-P PVDF 
membrane  ( Millipore ). Western blots were probed overnight at 4 ° C with  rabbit 
anti-PTPN14 1:1,000  ( Abcam ),  rabbit anti-EphrinB2 1:1,000  ( Abcam ),  rabbit 
anti- α -tubulin 1:10,000  ( Sigma ) or  HRP-conjugated anti- β -actin 1:10,000  ( Cell 
Signaling ) primary antibodies. Th  e secondary antibody used was  HRP-conjugated 
anti-rabbit antibody  ( GE healthcare ).   

  Mouse genetics   .   Comparison of percentage  Tgfb  1       −     /     −       pup viability was under-
taken by   χ   2  analysis ( Fig. 1a ). In  Fig. 1b , for comparisons across multiple strains, 
we fi t a logistic regression model with birth status as the responsive variable and 
mouse line as the independent variable, and performed the likelihood ratio test 
of this model over the model with only the mouse line as the eff ect. For analysis 
within each line, we fi t a logistic regression model with birth status as the response 
variable and strain as the independent variable, and performed the likelihood ratio 
test of this model over the null model.   

  Human family-based analysis   .   Statistical power was determined using the 
Quanto program ( http://hydra.usc.edu/gxe ). Familial association analyses were 
carried out using the GC model implemented in the soft ware package MENDEL 43 . 
Th  e GC model is an application of the Bradley – Terry method of ranking, which 
compares the observed number of transmissions of the at-risk allele from hetero-
zygous parent to aff ected off spring, to the expected transmissions (50 % ) 43,59 . 
Th  e best associations were validated using the Family Based Association Testing 
(FBAT) program, which correlates genotypes, conditional on parents, with the 
phenotypes. Th  e FBAT analyses were carried out both with and without unaff ected 
individuals. Th  e GC included the unaff ected individuals as the model uses full 
pedigree data. 

 Multiple testing issues in the family-based analyses were addressed using the 
false discovery rate method and SNP spectral decomposition 60  and permutation 
analysis that take into consideration the inter-SNPs correlations. We performed 
1,000 permutations for each family-based analysis. Th  e SNP spectral decomposi-
tion and permutation analysis gave similar cutoff  of signifi cance.
