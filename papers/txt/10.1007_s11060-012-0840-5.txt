Abstract The objective of this study was to investigate
the predictive value of [18F]-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron
emission tomography (FDG-PET) in detecting malignant
transformation of plexiform neuroﬁbromas in children with
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1). An electronic search of the
medical records was performed to determine patients with
NF1 who had undergone FDG-PET for plexiform neuro-
ﬁbroma between 2000 and 2011. All clinical, radiologic,
pathology
reports were
reviewed. Relationship between histologic diagnosis,
radiologic features and FDG-PET maximum standardized
uptake value (SUVmax) was evaluated. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of our insti-
tution. 1,450 individual patients were evaluated in our
Multidisciplinary Neuroﬁbromatosis Program, of whom 35
patients underwent FDG-PET for suspected MPNST based
on change or progression of clinical symptoms, or MRI

ﬁndings suggesting increased tumor size. Twenty patients
had concurrent pathologic specimens from biopsy/excision
of 27 distinct lesions (mean age 14.9 years). Pathologic
interpretation of these specimens revealed plexiform and
atypical plexiform neuroﬁbromas (n = 8 each), low grade
MPNST (n = 2), intermediate grade MPNST (n = 4), high
grade MPNST (n = 2), GIST (n = 1) and non-ossifying
ﬁbroma (n = 1). SUVmax of plexiform neuroﬁbromas
(including typical and atypical) was signiﬁcantly different
from MPNST (2.49 (SD = 1.50) vs. 7.63 (SD = 2.96),
p \ 0.001). A cutoff SUVmax value of 4.0 had high sen-
sitivity and speciﬁcity of 1.0 and 0.94 to distinguish
between PN and MPNST. FDG-PET can be helpful in
predicting malignant
transformation in children with
plexiform neuroﬁbromas and determining the need for
biopsy and/or surgical resection.

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1)
is a common autosomal
dominant disorder, with an incidence of one in 3,500 live
births [1, 2]. Individuals with NF1 are at risk to develop
benign and malignant tumors; the leading cause of mor-
tality among these individuals is the development of
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). The
lifetime risk of MPNST in patients with NF1 is 8–13%
and prognosis is poor, with a ﬁve-year overall survival of
21–41% [3].

MPNST typically results from malignant degeneration
of benign NF1 lesions, including plexiform neuroﬁbromas

123

(PN) and subcutaneous neuroﬁbromas [4, 5]. The presence
of a PN elevates the risk of MPNST formation by 20-fold
amongst NF1 patients [6]. The ability to identify predictors
of PN progression, therefore, is important for diagnostic
and therapeutic purposes. Clinical features suggestive of
malignancy include unremitting pain and/or a rapid
increase in the size or consistency, or development of new
neurologic deﬁcit [7]. Lesions are often followed with
MRI, CT, or [18F]-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. The
gold standard method of differentiation between PN and
MPNST is by pathologic evaluation after biopsy or
excision.

FDG-PET imaging is able to identify areas of high
glucose metabolism throughout the body [8–10]. A number
of studies using FDG-PET in adults with NF1 have dem-
onstrated a signiﬁcant difference in mean standardized
uptake values (SUV) between benign and malignant lesions
[11–13].

The objective of this study was to obtain correlative
imaging and pathology to investigate the predictive value
of FDG-PET in detecting malignant transformation of PN
and to distinguish benign from malignant tumors in chil-
dren with NF1. We hypothesize that the wider variability in
growth rates of these tumors in children may result in a
greater spectrum of FDG-avidity that can further differ-
entiate between benign and malignant tumors.

Materials and methods

Study population

This retrospective, HIPPA-compliant study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of our institution with
waiver of individual consent. An electronic search engine
using Boolean operators and combinations of the key
words NF1/neuroﬁbromatosis, PET, PN and MPNST was
used to identify subjects with NF1, less than 21 years of
age, who were evaluated at the Multidisciplinary Neuroﬁ-
bromatosis Program at Children’s Hospital Boston and
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between 2000 and 2011 and
who had also undergone FDG-PET evaluations for PN or
MPNST. Only those patients who had undergone sub-
sequent biopsy or resection were included. All patients met
the clinical criteria for NF1 [2].

Data collection included demographic information,
dates of initial
imaging that showed the abnormality,
indication for MRI and FDG-PET scans, and pathology.
Clinical data detailing the physical, neurological and neu-
ropathologic examinations were reviewed. Lesions were
classiﬁed as typical neuroﬁbroma, atypical neuroﬁbroma,
or MPNST. Atypical neuroﬁbroma was deﬁned as neuro-
ﬁbroma exhibiting nuclear atypia and/or hypercellularity,

123

without mitoses or necrosis [14, 15]. MPNST were clas-
siﬁed as low, intermediate or high grade depending on
degree of tumor differentiation, vascular invasion, necrosis
and number of mitoses [16].

Imaging studies

MRI studies were obtained using a 1.5-Tesla unit (GE
Medical Systems). The MRI protocol included multipla-
nar
conventional T1-weighted images, T2-weighted,
sagittal T1-weighted, axial T2-weighted, ﬂuid attenuated
(FLAIR) and fat-suppressed (FSEIR) inversion recovery,
and multiplanar
fat-suppressed
T1-weighted images. We reviewed all available neuro-
imaging studies to determine the extent of the lesion,
presence or absence of enhancement and evidence for
radiologic progression.

gadolinium-enhanced

FDG-PET imaging was performed on a GE Advance
Nxi PET scanner (GE Healthcare Technologies, Waukesha,
WI, USA). Whole body attenuation corrected images
were acquired in 2-dimensional mode, approximately
60 min after intravenous administration of 18F-FDG (dose
5.55 MBq/kg, minimum 18.5 MBq, and maximum 370
MBq). Images were acquired for 8 min per bed position
(5 min emission and 3 min transmission). All patients were
instructed to fast for at least 4 h prior to imaging, to refrain
from heavy exercise for the prior 24 h and to dress warmly
on the day of the test. Blood glucose was measured at time
of tracer administration. If glucose values were greater than
200 mg/dL,
the study was rescheduled. The maximum
standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was calculated by
drawing a region of interest (ROI) in a coronal section of
the FDG-PET using a Hermes Hybrid Viewer Gold 3
application (Hermes workstation, Stockholm, Sweden)
where a lesion was identiﬁed on MR or CT. SUVmax was
deﬁned as the maximum voxel FDG-PET value, calibrated
to the activity concentration within the lesion normalized
by the decay-corrected administered activity and the
patient’s weight. SUV calculations were made by a nuclear
physician (LD) who was blinded to the clinical history and
pathological results.

Several imaging studies were imported from external
institutions, as our institution was a local tertiary referral
center for NF1 patients with PN. In these cases, the raw
data for each PET examination was used to recalculate
SUVmax using consistent methods of adjustments to
injected dose, tissue tracer concentration, body weight, and
serum glucose levels. The SUVmax calculations were per-
formed by a nuclear physicist (FF) with ROI marked by the
nuclear medicine physician (LD). Both were blinded to the
clinical history and pathological results. This allowed us to
more reliably compare SUVmax between studies performed
on different imaging systems.

Statistics

The data were analyzed using the statistical database
software (JMP, SAS Institute), and dot plots were used to
display the distribution of FDG uptake. A student’s t test
was used to compare SUVmax values and histologic diag-
nosis of PN versus MPNST. p Values \0.05 were con-
sidered to be statistically signiﬁcant. Sensitivity and
speciﬁcity were calculated for several cutoff SUVmax val-
ues between 3.0 and 5.0. Corresponding binomial propor-
tion conﬁdence intervals for estimated sensitivity and
speciﬁcity were obtained using the Wilson method.

Results

A total of 1,450 individual patients were evaluated between
2000 and 2011. There were 35 patients who met clinical
criteria for NF1 who had undergone FDG-PET for PN or

suspected MPNST based on change or progression of
clinical symptoms. Of these, 20 patients had concurrent
pathologic specimens from biopsy or excision of 27 dis-
tinct FDG-avid lesions (Table 1). One of the lesions did not
have an MRI or CT performed near the time of PET
imaging;
the remaining 26 lesions had cross-sectional
imaging performed within 2 months of PET evaluation,
with mean and median interval
times of 18.0 and
10.0 days, respectively. The mean age of this subset of
individuals was 14.9 years (range 1–20) and included 7
males and 13 females. Indications for obtaining PET
imaging on these patients included: increased growth rate
(n = 8), lesional pain (n = 10), concern on MR imaging
(n = 5), worrisome lesion detected after imaging of other
index lesion (n = 2) and constitutional symptoms (weight
loss/cachexia, n = 1). Some patients had more than one
indication for imaging.

Lesions were present in a wide variety of locations
including the head and neck, thorax, pelvis, and extremities

ill-deﬁned margins, obscuration of neighboring fat planes
suggesting local invasion, and central necrosis (Fig. 3).

The location of the FDG-PET abnormalities in these
patients corresponded to those noted on CT and/or MR
imaging. PET imaging did not reveal new NF lesions that
had not been seen by either CT or MRI. Two outside
studies were excluded from SUV analysis because there
was a lack of one or more of the adjustment factors for
injected dose, body weight or serum glucose. For the
remaining 25 samples, SUVmax was calculated for all
lesions and measurements ranged from 0.56 to 12.9
(mean = 4.34, median = 3.00). When possible, PET
images were fused with MR or CT examinations to conﬁrm
accurate lesion characterization. A summary of SUVmax
data is seen in Table 1 and shown graphically in Fig. 4.
Two SUV measurements were obtained from an outside
hospital report. While the available PET data were insuf-
ﬁcient to recalculate and conﬁrm these ﬁndings within our
department, these data were still included in our analysis.
Pathologic interpretation of the surgical and biopsy
specimens revealed PN (n = 16),
low grade MPNST
(n = 2), intermediate grade MPNST (n = 4), high grade
MPNST (n = 4), gastrointestinal stromal
tumor (GIST,
n = 1), and non-ossifying ﬁbroma (NOF, n = 1). The two
patients with GIST and NOF were not included in further
analysis. Of the 16 PN specimens, eight were considered
typical neuroﬁbroma/PN and eight demonstrated atypical
features, including hypercellularity, hyperchromatism, and
nuclear enlargement and pleomorphism.

We evaluated the relationship between SUVmax and
pathology. Benign and APN demonstrated only mildly
increased uptake on FDG-PET (Fig. 2), whereas malignant
lesions typically demonstrated intense radiotracer uptake
(Fig. 3). Based on quantitative analysis of PET data,
PN and MPNSTs demonstrated mean maximum SUV of
2.49 (SD = 1.50) and 7.63 (SD = 2.96), respectively, a
difference that was statistically signiﬁcant (p \ 0.001).

tional imaging, PN and MPNST can exhibit similar fusi-
form shapes, enhance variably with contrast, and on MRI
are generally T2 hyperintense. Atypical PN (APN) and PN
typically have well-deﬁned borders and appear relatively
less heterogeneous on T2-weighted imaging (Fig. 2).
When present, characteristics favoring MPNST include

signiﬁcantly different from MPNST (p \ 0.001 for each).
sensitivity and speciﬁcity for distinguishing
between PN and MPNST were determined at SUVmax
values of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0. Sensitivity and speciﬁcity at
SUVmax of 3.0 were 1.0 (95% CI [0.7, 1.0]) and 0.81 (CI
[0.57, 0.93]), at SUVmax of 4.0 were 1.0 (CI [0.7, 1.0]) and
0.94 (CI [0.71–0.99]), and at SUVmax of 5.0 were 0.89 (CI
[0.57, 0.98]) and 0.94 (CI [0.71, 0.99]. This suggests an
optimal cutoff of 4.0 as the SUVmax that best predicts
malignant transformation.

Discussion

standard deviation (short line) for each subgroup are shown

When neuroﬁbromas were separated into PN and APN,
there was no signiﬁcant difference between subgroups: PN
and APN demonstrated mean SUVmax of 1.99 (SD = 0.81)

The major cause of morbidity in patients with NF1 is
the transformation of a PN into an MPNST. Both PN
and MPNST can have a variable appearance on con-
ventional cross-sectional
imaging, a ﬁnding that corre-
lates well
to their highly heterogeneous histological
appearance [17, 18]. Growth rates can also vary in PN,
and some lesions may demonstrate rapid growth while

MRI alone can detect malignant degeneration into

and high
T1-weighted signal intensity [18]. MRI, however, cannot be
used to predict which tumors are likely to progress. Early
radiologic indicators are crucial to predict which tumors are
more likely to be malignant, which might require biopsy or
surgical excision, and which are recurrent.

features

Our data support the hypothesis that benign and malig-
nant lesions are distinguishable by FDG-PET imaging and
that there is a correlation between mean SUVmax and tumor
grade in children with NF1. The most marked difference
was between benign/atypical neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs.
It is of note that there was no signiﬁcant difference in mean
SUVmax between benign and atypical neuroﬁbromas.
However, SUVmax values for APN lesions overlapped with
those of benign PN and MPNST, whereas there was no
overlap when comparing only benign PN against MPNST.
This may reﬂect sampling variability and the spectrum of
pathological changes that occur in the transition from
benign to atypical neuroﬁbroma to low grade MPNST.
Similar ﬁndings were also suggested on a prior study with a
study population mainly consisting of adults [13].

Clinico–radiologic–pathologic correlations of PN and
MPNST have been evaluated in adults, but there is limited
data in children. FDG-PET is currently recommended only
when there has been a signiﬁcant interval change in tumor
size on followup imaging, or if the clinical history is sus-
picious for malignancy. One study demonstrated that FDG-
PET is sensitive (95%) but less speciﬁc (72%) for MPNST,
with improved speciﬁcity using concurrent 11C-methionine
PET [20]. Another case series in adults used FDG-PET in
PN suspicious for malignant change and found a signiﬁcant
difference in mean SUV between the malignant and benign
tumors [13, 21]. A prospective study of FDG-PET in
children and young adults with PN without concerning
clinical or radiologic features at study entry demonstrated a
correlation between subsequent change in PN volume and
progressive increased FDG uptake, although correlative
pathology was not available [11]. Lastly, there is one recent
study of surveillance FDG-PET in children with optic
pathway gliomas and PN, but with limited correlative
pathology; in the two patients who underwent biopsy for
SUV [4, pathology demonstrated MPNST [22].

In our study, increased SUV was able to distinguish
between biopsy-conﬁrmed PN and MPNST, with a range of
SUV values that are comparable to those reported in the
largest adult series. In prior studies, an SUVmax cutoff of 3
was shown to discriminate between benign and malignant
lesions in adults, although there was a range of SUVmax
values (2.7–4.0) where overlap existed between benign and

123

malignant
tumors [10, 12, 13, 20, 23, 24]. FDG-PET,
however, may be falsely-negative in some malignant
lesions [25]. In our study, SUVmax of 4.0 could be used as a
cutoff to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors
with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity. This suggests that a
combination of FDG-PET and MRI may allow us to
accurately determine which lesions are at greatest risk of
malignant
transformation. Thus, FDG-PET may be an
important correlative imaging modality for evaluation and
follow-up of clinically and/or radiologically suspicious
lesions. There may also be a role for FDG-PET following
surgery or to determine response to treatment for MPNST
as well as to detect disease recurrence. Whether FDG-PET
should be used in routine screening of asymptomatic PN in
an effort
to be
determined.

to detect occult MPNST remains

Management of PN in the pediatric population is par-
ticularly challenging, as PN growth can be more rapid
during early childhood and later in adolescence, further
raising concern for malignant progression. In addition,
head and neck PN, which are more frequent in children, are
also less surgically accessible; interventions are considered
only if there is signiﬁcant neurological
impairment or
concern for malignant
transformation. Concerns about
ionizing radiation exposure also limit use of CT for routine
examinations. However, MRI examinations are often
lengthy and may require sedation or anesthesia. Despite
these challenges, this study demonstrates that combination
of FDG-PET and MR or CT imaging may help to identify
degeneration of PN to MPNST; MR and CT are crucial for
precise anatomical
lesion localization and
interpretation of FDG-PET data. To our knowledge this is
the ﬁrst study in the pediatric population that includes
concurrent
of
peripheral nerve sheath tumors and suggests that FDG-PET
may also assist in predicting tumor grade.

analysis

Our study had several limitations. Many patients were
referred for multidisciplinary consultation from outside
institutions and cases where pathology was not available
were not included. In addition, long-term followup was not
possible in some patients. The time interval between FDG-
PET imaging and biopsy ranged from under 1 week to
4 months. Since transformation of PN to MPNST is uni-
directional, we may have included MPNST that were PN
during prior MR or FDG-PET imaging; however,
the
natural history of neuroﬁbromas suggests that it is unlikely
that malignant transformation occurred between FDG-PET
and biopsy.

In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that FDG-
PET may be useful to help distinguish between benign and
malignant lesions in children with NF1 and further support a
correlation between mean SUVmax and tumor grade. Opti-
mal management of PN in children with NF1 depends on

early and accurate detection of malignant transformation
using reliable imaging techniques that provide correlative
information regarding tumor metabolism, particularly
in situations where biopsy or excision is associated with
high risk. Ultimately, FDG-PET may be useful as an adjunct
to traditional
imaging to help predict early treatment
response and disease remission. As new radionucleotide
tracers become available, this may further help provide
prognostic information regarding tumor grade.
