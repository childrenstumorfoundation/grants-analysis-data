Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common genetic disorder with a birth incidence of 1:2,000–3,000, is characterized by a highly variable
clinical presentation. To date, only two clinically relevant intragenic genotype-phenotype correlations have been reported for NF1
missense mutations affecting p.Arg1809 and a single amino acid deletion p.Met922del. Both variants predispose to a distinct mild
NF1 phenotype with neither externally visible cutaneous/plexiform neuroﬁbromas nor other tumors. Here, we report 162 individuals
(129 unrelated probands and 33 affected relatives) heterozygous for a constitutional missense mutation affecting one of ﬁve neighboring
NF1 codons—Leu844, Cys845, Ala846, Leu847, and Gly848—located in the cysteine-serine-rich domain (CSRD). Collectively, these
recurrent missense mutations affect 0.8% of unrelated NF1 mutation-positive probands in the University of Alabama at Birmingham
(UAB) cohort. Major superﬁcial plexiform neuroﬁbromas and symptomatic spinal neuroﬁbromas were more prevalent in these individ-
uals compared with classic NF1-affected cohorts (both p < 0.0001). Nearly half of the individuals had symptomatic or asymptomatic
optic pathway gliomas and/or skeletal abnormalities. Additionally, variants in this region seem to confer a high predisposition to
develop malignancies compared with the general NF1-affected population (p ¼ 0.0061). Our results demonstrate that these NF1
missense mutations, although located outside the GAP-related domain, may be an important risk factor for a severe presentation. A
genotype-phenotype correlation at the NF1 region 844–848 exists and will be valuable in the management and genetic counseling of
a signiﬁcant number of individuals.

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1 [MIM: 162200]), one of the
most common genetic disorders with a birth incidence of 1
in 2,000–3,000,1–3 is characterized by a highly variable

inter- and intrafamilial expressivity (see GeneReviews in
Web Resources). It is caused by loss-of-function genetic
variants in NF1 (MIM: 613113), located on chromosome
17q11.2. NF1 encodes neuroﬁbromin, a GTPase acti-
vating protein (GAP) that downregulates the RAS signal

transduction pathway through its GAP-related domain
(GRD).4,5 The most common ﬁrst signs of NF1 are multiple
cafe´-au-lait macules (CALMs) in >95% of infants and skin-
fold freckling in >80% of children by the age of 7 years.6
Other clinical features observed in >90% of adults with
NF1 are iris Lisch nodules and cutaneous neuroﬁ-
bromas.7 Individuals with a more severe phenotype pre-
sent with plexiform and/or spinal neuroﬁbromas, symp-
tomatic optic pathway gliomas (OPGs), as well as speciﬁc
osseous lesions, such as sphenoid wing or tibial dysplasia.
Approximately 50% of NF1-affected case subjects have
de novo mutations, while the remaining individuals inherit
the disorder from an affected parent (see GeneReviews in
Web Resources). According to the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) diagnostic criteria, at least two of the afore-
mentioned features are required to classify a person as hav-
ing the clinical diagnosis of NF1.8

Due to the variability in clinical presentation, age depen-
dency of most manifestations, the timing and number of
second hits in speciﬁc cells, and the wide NF1 allelic hetero-
geneity,
identiﬁcation of speciﬁc genotype-phenotype
correlations is extremely challenging. To date, more than
2,800 different germline NF1 pathogenic variants have
been identiﬁed in the University of Alabama at Birmingham
(UAB) cohort, with only 31 unique pathogenic variants
present in R0.5% of all unrelated individuals (L.M.M.,
unpublished data). Moreover, a mild NF1 phenotype,
including only CALMs and skinfold freckles, overlaps with
Legius syndrome (MIM: 611431), caused by mutations in
SPRED1 (MIM: 609291).9,10

So far, only three clinically signiﬁcant genotype-pheno-
type correlations have been reported. First, individuals
with a constitutional NF1 microdeletion usually show a

more severe phenotype compared to the general NF1-
affected population. The NF1 microdeletion syndrome
(MIM: 613675) is typically characterized by a large number
of neuroﬁbromas at a young age, dysmorphic facial
features (hypertelorism, downslanted palpebral ﬁssures,
broad nasal bridge,
low-set ears, micrognathia, coarse
face, facial asymmetry), and developmental delay and/or
intellectual disability. Individuals may present with cardiac
defects as well as growth and skeletal abnormalities. NF1
microdeletions have been associated with an increased
lifetime risk for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNSTs). The constitutional co-deletion of SUZ12
(MIM: 606245) within the common NF1-microdeletion
region is thought to be a risk factor for the malignant neo-
plasms.11 Second, individuals with a speciﬁc single amino
acid NF1 deletion (c.2970_2972del [p.Met992del]) present
with a milder phenotype. These individuals have multiple
CALMs with or without freckles, but no externally visible
cutaneous or plexiform neuroﬁbromas.12 A third geno-
type-phenotype correlation involving NF1 missense muta-
tions affecting arginine at position 1809 is also associated
with a distinct presentation,13,14 including developmental
delay and/or learning disabilities, pulmonic stenosis, and
Noonan-like features, but no external plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas or symptomatic OPGs. Both of these affected
amino acids reside outside the GRD domain.

Another distinct form of NF1 is familial spinal neuroﬁ-
bromatosis (FSNF [MIM: 162210]) originally described by
Pulst et al.15 in six affected members from two unrelated
families. It is characterized by bilateral and histologically
proven neuroﬁbromas of all spinal dorsal roots with a
paucity or absolute lack of cutaneous manifestations.16,17
So far, only 100 individuals (both familial and sporadic)

have been reported with this form.17 It has been suggested
that
individuals with the severe subtype of FSNF
more frequently carry an NF1 missense or splicing
mutation.18–20 Of particular interest are two families: a
two-generation family with three ﬁrst-degree relatives
reported by Pascual-Castroviejo et al.21 and a three-genera-
tion family with three ﬁrst-degree relatives reported by
Burkitt-Wright et al.16 Speciﬁc NF1 missense mutations
c.2542G>C (p.Gly848Arg) and c.2543G>A (p.Gly848Glu),
located in the cysteine-serine-rich domain (CSRD), were
present in all individuals affected by multiple spinal dorsal
root neuroﬁbromas. Despite the evidence that c.2542G>C
(p.Gly848Arg)
two
recent studies using mouse models did not recapitulate
the phenotype identiﬁed in humans.22,23 Genetically
engineered mice with c.2542G>C (p.Gly848Arg) mutation
developed neither OPGs nor plexiform neuroﬁbromas,
demonstrating phenotypic divergence between NF1-
affected individuals and mice.22,23

is a clearly pathogenic mutation,

In this study, we report a cohort of 129 unrelated
probands and 33 affected relatives heterozygous for a
constitutional missense mutation affecting one of ﬁve
neighboring NF1 codons—Leu844, Cys845, Ala846,
Leu847, and Gly848. These individuals have a high preva-
lence of a severe phenotype, including plexiform and
symptomatic spinal neuroﬁbromas, symptomatic optic
pathway gliomas, other malignant neoplasms, and bone
abnormalities. The current ﬁndings clearly demonstrate
that missense mutations outside the GRD are not solely
associated with a mild phenotype.

Material and Methods

Individuals and Phenotypic Data
A total of 162 individuals heterozygous for a missense mutation
affecting one of ﬁve neighboring NF1 codons (Leu844, Cys845,
Ala846, Leu847, and Gly848) were included in the study. Blood
samples from 78 individuals (67 probands and 11 relatives) were
originally sent to the UAB Medical Genomics Laboratory for
molecular NF1 genetic testing to establish or conﬁrm the diagnosis
for NF1. This initial study was expanded to include an additional
84 individuals (62 probands and 22 relatives), molecularly diag-
nosed in collaborating institutions (as detailed in Table S1).

All individuals included in this study were clinically assessed
using the standardized phenotypic checklist form as previously
reported (Figure S1).14 The clinical data were collected at the
time of mutation analysis and re-veriﬁed for accuracy by refer-
ring physicians co-authoring this paper at the time of this study.
Additionally, referring physicians updated the phenotypic data
at the time of this genotype-phenotype study, when available,
i.e., when the individual had been seen and followed at their
institution after genetic testing results were reported. The pheno-
typic data and age provided correspond to the latest clinical
evaluation. The phenotypic checklist form consists of two parts:
(1) general
information including gender, date of birth,
ethnicity, height, head circumference (HC), weight, fulﬁllment
of the NIH diagnostic criteria, and mode of inheritance and
(2) NF1 signs and symptoms, including CALMs, skinfold freck-

ling, Lisch nodules, cutaneous and subcutaneous, plexiform
and spinal neuroﬁbromas, OPGs and other neoplasms, skeletal
and cardiac abnormalities, development and education levels,
presence/absence of Noonan syndrome features, and segmental
phenotype.

Fifteen major clinical features of NF1 were selected for the
genotype-phenotype correlation study (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Indi-
viduals with missing data for a particular sign and/or symptom
were classiﬁed as ‘‘unknown’’ or ‘‘not speciﬁed’’ and consequently
excluded from that part of the genotype-phenotype analysis. Most
features were identiﬁed by physical examination; ophthalmologic
examination for Lisch nodules and imaging to detect asymptom-
atic OPGs and spinal neuroﬁbromas was not performed in most
individuals. Brain and spine/whole-body MRI was done mainly
in individuals with signs and/or symptoms indicative of OPGs
or internal/spinal neuroﬁbromas; however, depending on institu-
tional policies, some individuals were screened by MRI despite the
absence of symptoms. Noonan phenotype was diagnosed if at
least two of the following features were observed: short stature,
hypertelorism, low-set ears, webbed neck, ptosis, midface hypo-
plasia, or pulmonic stenosis. To evaluate short stature and macro-
cephaly, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center
for Disease Control
(CDC) growth charts and the Gerhard
Nellhaus’ curve24 were used as previously described.14 Short
stature and macrocephaly were deﬁned as height below or equal
to the 3rd percentile (PC % 3) and as head circumference equal
or above the 98th percentile (PC R 98), respectively. For cognitive
impairment/learning disabilities,
individuals with attention
deﬁcit disorder (ADD) and/or attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disor-
der (ADHD) but normal development were classiﬁed as normal.

To establish a genotype-phenotype association, we used the
same approach as previously described.14 We compared the phe-
notypes of individuals with missense mutations affecting codons
844–848 with the cohort of 169 individuals with missense muta-
tions affecting p.Arg1809,13,14,25–27 47 individuals heterozygous
for c.2970_2972del (p.Met992del) mutations,12 and previously
described large-scale NF1-affected individual
cohorts with
‘‘classic’’ NF1.7,28–40

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of

all participating institutions offering clinical genetic testing.

Molecular Analysis
In the Medical Genomics Laboratory at UAB, comprehensive
NF1 mutation screening using an RNA-based approach comple-
mented by DNA-dosage analysis was performed as previously
described.41,42 The status of the speciﬁc familial mutation in
relatives was ascertained by bidirectional Sanger sequencing
(ABI PRISM 3730, Life Technologies).

The nomenclature of the mutations is based on NF1 mRNA
sequence GenBank: NM_000267.3 according to the recommenda-
tions of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). For exon
numbering we used the NCBI numbering, followed by the histor-
ical numbering in square brackets originally developed by the NF1
community.42

In Silico Prediction of Effect of Missense Mutations
Eight software programs were used to predict the effects of
missense variants: two online in silico prediction tools (CADD
v.1.3 and PolyPhen-2) and six complementary tools (Grantham
Difference,
SpliceSiteFinder-like, MaxEntScan,
NNSplice v.0.9, and Human Splicing Finder v.2.4.1) embedded

hIndividual was classiﬁed as having a severe phenotype if at least one of the following features was observed: plexiform and/or symptomatic spinal neuroﬁbroma, symptomatic OPG, malignant neoplasm, or osseous lesions.
iAmong individuals with a missense mutation affecting codon 846, the status of plexiform and spinal neuroﬁbromas was known only for 2/6 individuals (UG-R0781-S and UG-R665-F), thus a severe phenotype cannot be
excluded in the remaining four individuals with missing data.

in Alamut visual software v.2.9.0 (Interactive Biosoftware). The
presence or absence of the variants was checked in population da-
tabases, including the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD),
1000 Genomes, and the Exome Variant Server (EVS) as well as in
disease databases: the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD),
ClinVar, and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) (last
accessed May 2017). Evolutionary conservation for human neuro-
ﬁbromin GenBank: NP_000258.1 residues 804–950 was evaluated
using Clustal software v.2.0.12. The palindromic sequences and
quadruplex forming G-Rich sequences (QGRS) were identiﬁed by
Palindrome search and QGRS Mapper, respectively.

Interpretation of variant pathogenicity was performed based on
the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)
recommendations.43

Statistical Analysis
For univariate analysis, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to
compare categorical variables with a p value < 0.05 considered
as statistically signiﬁcant. The resulting p values were adjusted
for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H)
procedure with false discovery rates (FDRs) of 0.05 and 0.01. The
95% conﬁdence interval (CI) was also calculated when appro-
priate. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad
and VassarStats softwares.

Description of Missense Mutations Affecting Codons
844–848
Exon 21 [16] is the largest NF1 exon (441 nucleotides), and
in it we identiﬁed, besides the missense variants affecting
the codons 844–848, a total of 19 different missense vari-
ants in 35 unrelated individuals from the UAB cohort.
Fourteen of these alterations were classiﬁed as variants of
uncertain signiﬁcance (8/19) or likely benign (6/19) and
reported 1–3 times in the UAB cohort (Figure S2). Only
ﬁve variants were classiﬁed as pathogenic (4/19) or likely
pathogenic (1/19) according to the current recommenda-
tions.43 Region 844–848 in exon 21 [16] stood out due to
its high frequency of variants compared with the neigh-
boring codons, indicating functional importance (Figures
S2 and S3). A similar distribution and spectrum of missense
alterations in the NF1 exon 21 [16] was observed in
the publicly available databases (ClinVar, LOVD, and
HGMD). Besides a clear cluster of recurrent variants in
codons 844–848, other alterations spread over the entire
exon 21 [16] were mostly classiﬁed as variants of uncertain
signiﬁcance and reported 1–2 times in these databases
(Figure S2). The frequency of this cluster of variants in aa
844–848 is 0.8% (67/8,400) in unrelated NF1 mutation-
positive individuals from the UAB cohort, second only to
the p.Arg1809 (1.2%), and therefore represents a signiﬁ-
cant hotspot for missense mutations within NF1.

In the 129 unrelated individuals reported here, we
identiﬁed 12 different NF1 missense alterations affecting
one of ﬁve neighboring codons in exon 21 [16] (Table 1
and Figure 1). Within the group of individuals with
p.Gly848Arg, two different substitutions were observed:

c.2542G>A (6/14) and c.2542G>C (8/14). Detailed charac-
teristics of the identiﬁed missense mutations are shown in
Tables S2–S4 and Figure 1. All variants identiﬁed in this
study with conﬁrmed origin of
the variant were
submitted to the LOVD and ClinVar databases. Based
on the data accumulated in this report
(Tables S1
and S2), these variants can all be classiﬁed as pathogenic
(Table S4) according to current recommendations.43

the 12 were present in ClinVar, including 3/8 classiﬁed as

[p.Leu847Pro], and c.2542G>C [p.Gly848Arg]), 1/8 as likely

Genomes Project; c.2531T>G (p.Leu844Arg) was reported
once in Latino (the variant’s frequency in all populations
is 0.00041%). Based on in silico analysis, all alterations are
predicted to be deleterious (SIFT) and probably or possibly
damaging (PolyPhen-2). Additionally, CADD classiﬁed all
variants as more likely to have deleterious effects
(range: 22.6 to 31). In contrast to results of in silico analysis,
suggesting a possible effect of two identiﬁed alterations
(c.2542G>A and c.2543G>A) on splicing through creation
of a novel exonic splice acceptor sequence, transcript
analysis and sequencing showed a minor effect on splicing
only for c.2542G>A in three individuals (UAB-R9493, UAB-
R1474, and UAB-R0008), i.e., low levels of r.2410_2543del.
The other individuals with c.2542G>A screened with an
RNA-based approach (UAB-R3513 and UAB-R4476)

whom no missplicing was observed also carried the nearby
benign variant c.2544G>A (p.Gly848¼) (rs17883704) with
both variants proven to reside in cis through next-genera-
tion sequencing. As missplicing was observed only in indi-
viduals carrying c.2542G>A in the absence of rs17883704

for
c.2536G>C (p.Ala846Pro), were proven to be de novo in at
least one proband; a total of 26 probands with unaffected
parents were proven to have a de novo mutation, but formal
conﬁrmation of paternity/maternity by identity testing was
pursued only for individuals tested in the Netherlands

Figure 1. Spectrum of Missense Mutations Affecting NF1 Codons 844–848 in the Cohort of 129 Probands and 33 Relatives
Shown are 129 probands (A) and 33 relatives (B). Each number in circle corresponds with the total number of individuals heterozygous
for a speciﬁc mutation. The black dotted lines on the panels present the region 844–848. The ﬁgure was prepared using the ProteinPaint

(ROT-R02233, ROT-R22853, and ROT-R17435). Addition-
ally, 7/12 missense mutations (c.2530C>T [p.Leu844Phe],

c.2540T>C [p.Leu847Pro],
c.2542G>C [p.Gly848Arg], and c.2543G>A [p.Gly848Glu])
segregated with the phenotype (at least one individual per
family) in 23 affected ﬁrst-degree relatives from 15 families
(Tables S1 and S2 and Figure S5). Finally, all missense muta-
tions affecting amino acids 844–848 are located in a highly
conserved region of the CSRD (amino acids 543–909;
Figure S6). Besides cysteine at position 845 that is conserved
up to zebraﬁsh, all remaining amino acids are evolution-
arily conserved up to Drosophila melanogaster (Ala846 and
Gly848) and even to yeast IRA1 and/or IRA2 (Leu844 and
Leu847). In chimpanzee, rat, and mouse all amino acids
from 775 to 856 are fully evolutionarily conserved. None
of these variants has been functionally characterized.

Demographic and Clinical Characterization of the
Studied Cohort
A total of 162 individuals from 129 unrelated families
were enrolled in the study,
including 37/129 (28.7%)
familial and 89/129 (69%) sporadic case subjects; 3/129
(2.3%)
individuals had an unknown family history

(ROT-R13734, ROT-R89874, and CAR-R8012M6). Detailed
demographic and clinical descriptions of the individuals
included in the study are shown in Tables 1 and S1 and
Figure S5.

The complete phenotypic checklist forms were collected
from 151/162 individuals (93.2%). Of these, 125/151
(82.8%) fulﬁlled the NIH diagnostic criteria and 118/151
(78.2%) fulﬁlled the NIH diagnostic criteria if family his-
tory was excluded as a criterion. Among 26/151 individuals
who did not fulﬁll the NIH diagnostic criteria (with 20/26
being %8 years), multiple CALMs-only (>5) were present
in 16/26, <6 CALMs-only were present in 8/26, and 2/26
did not have any pigmentary manifestations but had
externally visible plexiform neuroﬁbromas (UAB-R9135
and UG-R5831) (Table S5). CALMs-only (<6) were observed
mostly in individuals with a missense mutation at
codon 848 (5/8 with c.2542G>C [p.Gly848Arg], 1/8 with
c.2542G>A

Cutaneous and subcutaneous neuroﬁbromas were found
in 68.1% (47/69 R19 years) and 50.8% (33/65 R19 years)
of the case subjects, respectively. Thirty adults had both
types of tumors (30/64 R19 years, 46.9%). Ten individuals
R17 years had >100 cutaneous and/or subcutaneous
nodules,
47-year-old man previously
reported45 with >1,400 neuroﬁbromas (individual counts
of externally visible neuroﬁbromas; BRA-R38) and a
17-year-old woman (ROT-R1CMUL) with >500 cutaneous
neuroﬁbromas, >100 subcutaneous neuroﬁbromas, and
>100 intradermal neuroﬁbromas. Nine out of
ten
individuals with a very high number of neuroﬁbromas
carried a missense mutation at codon 847: c.2540T>G
(p.Leu847Arg) (2/9) or c.2540T>C (p.Leu847Pro) (7/9,
including two individuals with metastasized MPNSTs). In
16 case subjects with ‘‘several’’ neuroﬁbromas, a more pre-
cise estimated number was not reported. Eight individuals
(UAB-R5776, UAB-R3618, UAB-R4624, UAB-R7447,
UAB-R1002, UAB-R1037-M, UAB-R3237, PAD-R500-C1)
were reported to have a single cutaneous or subcutaneous
nodule (none histopathologically conﬁrmed); these indi-
viduals were considered as ‘‘negative for the criterion of
neuroﬁbromas’’ as R2 cutaneous/subcutaneous neuroﬁ-
bromas are required according to the NIH clinical criteria.
45% of the individuals R9 years had known plexiform
neuroﬁbromas (41/92 R9 years; 47/143 all ages), including
externally visible (n ¼ 36) and internal (n ¼ 5) tumors. For
six case subjects,
the information was not provided
whether plexiform neuroﬁbromas were identiﬁed clinically
or by MRI. Among all individuals with plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas, 31/47 presented with one plexiform tumor and
16/47 with R2 plexiform neuroﬁbromas. Plexiform tumors
were found in the head, face, and neck area (35.7%, 25/70),
limbs (34.3%, 24/70), trunk (17.1%, 12/70), back (n ¼ 3),
abdomen (n ¼ 3), pelvis (n ¼ 2), and chest (n ¼ 1).

Symptomatic spinal neuroﬁbromas visible by MRI were
found in 15.2% of individuals (12/79 R9 years; 13/127
all ages). Forty asymptomatic individuals received MRI
screening, leading to the identiﬁcation of another seven
case subjects with spinal tumors (Table S6). Approximately
one-third of the individuals with spinal tumors (6/20) had
fewer than 6 CALMs and no skinfold freckling, whereas in
60% (12/20) plexiform neuroﬁbromas were observed (with
11/12 being externally visible).

Symptomatic OPGs, conﬁrmed by MRI imaging, were
found in 11/104 of
than 5 years
(10.6%), whereas asymptomatic OPGs were present in

individuals older

16/52 additional individuals who underwent MRI exami-
nation (30.8% R5 years). In 19 of 27 symptomatic and
asymptomatic OPGs, the detailed information about the
tumor’s location was collected, involving optic nerves
(2 symptomatic OPGs and 7 asymptomatic OPGs), chiasm
(1 symptomatic OPG and 1 asymptomatic OPG), or both
locations (6 symptomatic OPGs and 2 asymptomatic
OPGs). Three children were diagnosed with a symptomatic
OPG (PAD-R300) or asymptomatic OPGs (UAB-R3714 and
UAB-R3513) before age 4 years (Table S7).

Skeletal abnormalities were frequently reported (48/
144 all ages) and included scoliosis (27/144 all ages,
but 20/64 R19 years) and pectus anomalies (10/144 all
ages: pectus carinatum 6/10 and excavatum 4/10). In
addition, long bone dysplasia (n ¼ 4), pseudarthrosis
(n ¼ 2), tibial dysplasia (n ¼ 1), bone cysts (n ¼ 2),
sphenoid wing dysplasia (n ¼ 2), ulnar aplasia, likely
representing the severe end of ulnar pseudarthrosis
with bone resorption and absence of ulnar bone
(n ¼ 1), dural ectasia (n ¼ 1), 4th lumbar vertebrae
fragmentation (n ¼ 1), bowed long bones (n ¼ 1),
clinodactyly (n ¼ 1), postaxial polydactyly (n ¼ 1), and
cherubism (n ¼ 1) were observed in the studied group.
Noonan syndrome features were observed in 10/134
(7.5%) individuals. One previously reported individual
(UAB-R624) with a family history of PTPN11-positive
(MIM: 176876) Noonan syndrome (MIM: 163950) had a
severe phenotype of pulmonic stenosis and aortic coarcta-
tion, dysmorphic features (high forehead, hypertelorism,
downslanting palpebral ﬁssures, short neck with a low
posterior hair line), short stature, pectus carinatum, >5
CALMs, axillary and inguinal freckling, plexiform and
cutaneous neuroﬁbromas, and symptomatic OPG with
signs of hydrocephalus.46 Besides the familial PTPN11

provided developmental data, 56 individuals had
abnormal development presenting with at least one of
the following forms of cognitive impairment and/or
learning difﬁculties: learning disabilities (n ¼ 43), develop-
mental delay (n ¼ 30), speech delay (n ¼ 8), ADD (n ¼ 8),
ADHD (n ¼ 10), motor delay (n ¼ 5), autism spectrum (n ¼

signiﬁcant global developmental delay with/without
speech delay,
learning difﬁculties, and/or AD(H)D,
including one with a full scale intelligence quotient
(FSIQ) score 59. Additionally,
three individuals were
reported to have frequent migraine headaches and two
had epilepsy and/or psychiatric problems.

For 139/162 individuals, data on the presence or absence
of tumors other than neuroﬁbromas and OPGs was avail-
able. 13 of 139 (9.4%) individuals were diagnosed with
malignant neoplasms (Table S8),
including embryonal
rhabdomyosarcoma (3/13), MPNST (7/13, including one
woman with MPNST and BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer),
colon cancer (1/13), medullary thyroid carcinoma (1/13),
and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (1/13).
Individuals R14 years old with c.2540T>C (p.Leu847Pro)
had a higher number of malignant neoplasms compared to
individuals carrying other missense mutations in the stud-
ied region (p ¼ 0.0448; Table S9). Moreover, this mutation
was present in most case subjects with MPNST (5/7),
except for one each carrying c.2543G>A (p.Gly848Glu)
or c.2530C>T (p.Leu844Phe). Four of seven individuals
with MPNST died before age 30 years (Table S8). Hypotha-
lamic glioma (n ¼ 1), lipoma (n ¼ 1), cerebral tumors
(n ¼ 3), non-ossifying ﬁbroma (n ¼ 2), and odontogenic
ﬁbroma (n ¼ 1) were also reported.

The frequency of clinical

in individuals
heterozygous for missense mutations affecting one of ﬁve
neighboring codons 844–848 is presented in Table 2. A
lower number of CALMs, freckling, and cutaneous neuro-
ﬁbromas was observed in case subjects with missense
mutations at codon 848 (all p < 0.0001; Table S9); how-
ever, these individuals had a higher prevalence of symp-
tomatic spinal neuroﬁbromas (p ¼ 0.0012; Table S9).

Taken together, a severe phenotype, including at least
one of the following features (plexiform and/or symptom-
atic spinal neuroﬁbromas, symptomatic OPGs, malignant
neoplasm, or osseous lesions) was observed in 75% of adult
NF1-affected individuals (56/75 R19 years; Table 2).

Comparison of Clinical Features Observed in the Studied
Cohort with Individuals Heterozygous for p.Arg1809
and p.Met992del Mutations and Cohort of Individuals
with ‘‘Classic’’ NF1 Phenotype
Comparison of clinical features of the studied group with
the NF1 p.Arg1809 and p.Met992del cohorts as well as pre-
viously described large-scale cohorts of individuals with
‘‘classic’’ NF1 is shown in Table 3. The complete list of
adjusted p values with FDRs at 0.05 and 0.01 after B-H
correction for multiple testing is presented in Table S10.
All p values % 0.0125 and p values % 0.0012 remained

statistically signiﬁcant after applying the B-H correction
at FDRs of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.

In the current study, we observed a signiﬁcantly
higher number of major external plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas compared with the NF1 p.Arg1809 and the NF1
p.Met992del cohorts, as well as classic NF1-affected pop-
ulation (all p < 0.0001; statistically signiﬁcant after B-H
correction at FDR of 0.01). Importantly, while none of
the individuals carrying the p.Arg1809 and p.Met992del
had external plexiform, cutaneous, and/or subcutaneous
neuroﬁbromas, 71% of the individuals R19 years with
a missense mutation affecting codons 844–848 had cuta-
neous and/or subcutaneous neuroﬁbromas (p < 0.0001;
statistically signiﬁcant after B-H correction at FDR of
0.01) and 39% of
the individuals R9 years had
externally visible plexiform neuroﬁbromas (p < 0.0001;
statistically signiﬁcant after B-H correction at FDR of
0.01). Compared with p.Arg1809, p.Met992del, and
classic NF1-affected cohorts, at least 5-fold greater preva-
lence of symptomatic spinal neuroﬁbromas was reported
in the studied group (0%–2.1% versus 10.2%) which was
statistically signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.01 for the general
NF1-affected population (p < 0.0001) and at FDR of
0.05 for the p.Arg1809 cohort (p ¼ 0.0022).

Symptomatic and asymptomatic OPGs were more
frequent
compared to individuals with p.Arg1809,
p.Met992del, and classic NF1, with symptomatic and
asymptomatic OPGs statistically increased after B-H correc-
tion at FDR of 0.05 in the 844–848 cohort compared to the
classic NF1-affected cohorts (p ¼ 0.0125 and p ¼ 0.0043,
respectively) and at FDR of 0.01 compared with the
p.Arg1809 cohort (p ¼ 0.0002 and p < 0.0001, respec-
tively). The overall prevalence of malignant neoplasms,
other than neuroﬁbromas and OPGs, was also higher in
the studied group compared to a large cohort of classic
NF1-affected individuals (9.4% versus 3.4%; p ¼ 0.0061,
statistically signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.05 after B-H correction).
Additionally, the aa 844–848 cohort had a signiﬁcantly
increased frequency of skeletal abnormalities compared
to individuals with p.Arg1809 and classic NF1 phenotypes
(both statistically signiﬁcant after B-H correction at FDR of
0.05), regardless of the age. Scoliosis was reported more
frequently compared with p.Arg1809 individuals (31.3%
versus 12.5% in R 19 years), but this difference was not
statistically signiﬁcant after B-H correction.

The prevalence of CALMs was lower than in p.Arg1809
and p.Met992del cohorts (both signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.05
after B-H correction), while skinfold freckles occurred
more commonly in classic NF1-affected cohorts than in
the studied group (signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.01 after B-H
correction). Noonan syndrome features were signiﬁcantly
less frequent in the studied group compared to individuals
with p.Arg1809 (signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.01 after B-H correc-
tion). In line with this ﬁnding, pulmonic stenosis was very
rarely observed in the cohort (1.8% versus 10.6% in the
p.Arg1809 cohort; signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.05 after B-H
correction). All cohorts, except for the p.Met992del, shared

Discussion

We present 162 individuals heterozygous for a constitu-
tional NF1 missense mutation in one of ﬁve neighboring
codons 844–848 who have a high prevalence of a severe
NF1 phenotype, including plexiform and/or symptomatic
spinal neuroﬁbromas, symptomatic OPGs, and other
malignant neoplasms, as well as bone abnormalities.
The frequency of the cluster of these mutations is 0.8%
(67/8,400) in unrelated NF1 mutation-positive individuals
from the UAB cohort, second only to the p.Arg1809
(1.2%) among the missense variants.

One of the most severe complications in NF1-affected
individuals are clinically apparent plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas affecting 15%–30% of the NF1-affected general
population.7,34,47–50 In this study, externally visible plexi-
form neuroﬁbromas were found in 39% of individuals
R9 years, therefore signiﬁcantly higher compared with
p.Arg1809 and p.Met992del and classic NF1-affected
cohorts (signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.01 after B-H correction;
Tables 3 and S10). Individuals in this study did not
undergo whole-body MRI;
the frequency
provided here is a likely underestimate, as internal asymp-
tomatic plexiform neuroﬁbromas were not accounted for.
As plexiform neuroﬁbromas have been suggested to be
associated with a higher lifetime risk for the development
of MPNSTs,50–53 the ﬁnding of MPNSTs in 5% (7/139) of
the affected in our cohort, which is twice as high as
reported by Huson et al.
in the South-East Wales
cohort,28,29 is in line with expectations.

therefore,

Approximately 24%–40% of NF1-affected individuals
develop spinal neuroﬁbromas,35,39,52 but they are most
often asymptomatic and not detectable by physical exam-
ination. The estimated prevalence of symptomatic spinal
neuroﬁbromas in the general NF1-affected population is
less than 2%.7,34,35 In the current study, a high number

(statistically signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.01 after B-H correc-
tion): 13/127 (10.2%) for all ages and 12/79 (15.2%) for
R9 years. Kluwe et al. suggested that spinal neuroﬁbromas
cause symptoms mainly in older case subjects (mean age
32.8 years),18 but 4 of 13 symptomatic individuals in our
cohort were below age 18 (range: 7–17 years). In 40 indi-
viduals who underwent MRI examination, an additional
seven case subjects with asymptomatic spinal neuroﬁ-
bromas were found. Among all affected individuals, ﬁve
belonged to two previously reported multi-generation
families (UG-R923 and MAN-R95417G) where the spinal
tumors segregated within the family.16,21 For two relatives
of these probands, the spinal neuroﬁbromas were recog-
nized only after MRI, although the tumor burden was

This rare form of NF1 is called familial spinal neuroﬁbro-
matosis (FSNF).

Plexiform and spinal tumors as well as subcutaneous
neuroﬁbromas are associated with a severe NF1 phenotype
and may result in signiﬁcant morbidity in children and
adults.54,55 OPGs, the most common brain tumors in chil-
dren, are another complication in the general NF1-affected
population.56 The overall prevalence of OPGs in the
NF1-affected population is 11%–20%,39,50,57 but only
30% of these individuals have clinically symptomatic
OPGs and present with impaired visual acuity, visual ﬁeld
loss, abnormal color vision, squint, proptosis, and/or
hypothalamic dysfunction.49 Most symptomatic OPGs
are diagnosed before age 7 years57 with the mean age of
5 years.58 In the studied group, symptomatic OPGs were
found in 11/104 (10.6%) of individuals R5 years, which
is more
compared with p.Arg1809 and
p.Met992del cohorts (none of the individuals had OPGs)
and with classic NF1-affected population (3.9%); however,
after applying the B-H correction, only the result of
comparison with p.Arg1809 cohort and the general NF1-
affected population remained statistically signiﬁcant at
FDR of 0.05 (Tables 3 and S10). Furthermore, there was a
higher prevalence of asymptomatic OPGs
in 16/52
(30.8%) individuals R5 years who underwent MRI exami-
nation (statistically signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.01).

frequent

the most common malignancies

Individuals with NF1 are at higher risk to develop spe-
ciﬁc malignancies compared with the general population,
signiﬁcantly increasing mortality.59,60 Besides the high-
grade gliomas,
in
NF1-affected children are rhabdomyosarcomas, JMML,
and neuroblastomas, but accurate estimates on prevalence
are not available due to the rarity of these tumors.61,62
Based on the data provided by Sung et al. and Crucis
et al.,63,64 the prevalence of rhabdomyosarcomas in chil-
dren with NF1 is estimated at 0.4%–0.5%, while Chang
and Shannon reported that the individual risk of JMML
in NF1 is 0.04%.65 In the studied group, three NF1-
affected children younger than 5 years developed embry-
onal rhabdomyosarcomas, including one individual, now
>26 years, who survived both a rhabdomyosarcoma and
astrocytoma grade II, diagnosed at the age 2 and 15 years,
respectively. Furthermore, one 5-year-old girl (out of 50
children %8 years) presented with <6 CALMs and JMML.
This girl was heterozygous for two pathogenic NF1 muta-
tions in the blood, c.2542G>A (p.Gly848Arg) as well as
c.1246C>T (p.Arg416*), with p.Gly848Arg being the ﬁrst
hit given the absence of p.Arg416* in buccal swabs, indi-
cating somatic mosaicism for p.Arg416*. A UK popula-
tion-based hospital admission and death certiﬁcate study
found that individuals with NF1 have, after excluding
the well-established risks of nervous systems tumors, a
2.7-fold increased risk of developing cancers of the esoph-
agus, stomach, colon, liver, lung, bone, thyroid, malignant
melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic myeloid
leukemia, breast, and ovary.66 In the current study, we

noted recurrent malignant
tumors, such as MPNSTs
(7/139; 5%) (Tables S1 and S8). Among these individuals,
one 44-year-old woman previously described with the
missense mutation c.2540T>C (p.Leu847Pro) had MPNST,
BRCA1/2-negative (MIM: 113705 and 600185) breast can-
cer as well as a high number of cutaneous neuroﬁbromas
(>100).67 In addition, one individual developed a medul-
lary thyroid carcinoma and three ﬁrst-degree relatives of
a Belgian proband with c.2540T>C (p.Leu847Pro) died
from malignancies (a metastasized colon adenocarcinoma
and two MPNSTs, both deceased before age 26). Taken
together, the overall prevalence of malignant neoplasms
in the studied group was substantially higher than in the
published datasets of the general NF1-affected population
(signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.05 after B-H correction; Tables 3
and S10). Furthermore, speciﬁcally mutation p.Leu847Pro
seems to confer a high predisposition to develop malig-
nant tumors compared to other missense variants reported
in this study (p < 0.0448; Table S9), although the CADD
score of this variant is not the highest among the studied
region (only 26.1; Table S2). Given the predominance of
the p.Leu847Pro mutations in the studied cohort (70/162
individuals), larger datasets are required to further reﬁne
the increased tumor
risk associated with the other
mutations within the studied region.

Skeletal abnormalities, including long bone dysplasia
with or without pseudarthrosis, scoliosis, sphenoid wing
dysplasia, bone cysts, including cherubism, non-ossifying
ﬁbromas and osseous giant cell lesions, hand anomalies,
anterior chest wall anomalies, and short stature, can
lead to serious clinical consequences and signiﬁcant
morbidity.68 We observed a clear overall increase in the
number of skeletal anomalies compared with p.Arg1809
(FDR of 0.05 after B-H correction) and the general NF1-af-
fected population (FDR of 0.01 after B-H correction). As
many as 33.3% of the NF1-affected individuals (48/144)
presented with one or more osseous lesion, scoliosis
(n ¼ 27), and pectus anomalies (n ¼ 10) being most
frequent (18.8% and 6.9%, respectively). The overall fre-
quency would be higher if individuals with short stature
(40.3%; 58/144) are included. Rarely reported complica-
tions possibly associated with NF1 status included cherub-
ism, chronic arthritis of multiple joints with elbow
contractures, clinodactyly of the 3th–5th toes, postaxial
polydactyly, and ulnar aplasia, likely representing the se-
vere end of ulnar pseudarthrosis with bone resorption
and absence of the ulnar bone. Interestingly, the latter
has been reported only in two NF1-affected case sub-
jects.69 Mild to moderate scoliosis was reported in only
18% of NF1-positive individuals with bilateral neuroﬁ-
bromas of all spinal roots;17 however, in our study we
observed co-occurrence of scoliosis and spinal tumors in
45% (9/20) of individuals with conﬁrmed symptomatic
or asymptomatic spinal neuroﬁbromas (not necessarily
affecting all dorsal roots) (Table S6). An additional 11 indi-
viduals had scoliosis without evidence of spinal neuroﬁ-
bromas by MRI (Table S1).

Cohorts of individuals with NF1 missense mutations
affecting codons 844–848 and classic NF1-affected popula-
tion shared a similar frequency for short stature and
macrocephaly. Noonan syndrome features were rarely
observed in the studied group compared with the
p.Arg1809 cohort (signiﬁcant at FDR of 0.01 after B-H
correction). In line with previous studies,7,34,39,70 intellec-
tual disability, developmental delay, and/or
learning
difﬁculties were frequently observed in the current
study (40.6%).

Among the 129 unrelated probands with a missense
mutation affecting codons 844–848, p.Leu847Pro and
p.Gly848Arg are the most recurrent variants, found in 58
and 14 unrelated individuals, respectively (Table S2 and
Figure 1). Both alterations are associated with a severe
NF1 phenotype, including a high prevalence of plexiform
neuroﬁbromas and skeletal abnormalities, compared to the
general NF1-affected population. However, missense muta-
tions at p.Gly848 predispose with a greater frequency to
symptomatic or asymptomatic spinal
tumors, which
were found in 70% of probands carrying the p.Gly848Arg
or p.Gly848Glu mutations (9/13 R9 years, but in 9/10 R9
years who received MRI screening), which is slightly
higher than in individuals presenting with a severe pheno-
type caused by a total NF1 deletion (8/13 R9 years).71
Several of the severely affected individuals with a missense
mutation at p.Gly848 had only few or no pigmentary skin
ﬁndings. So far, 100 case subjects have been reported
with the true ‘‘spinal NF’’ phenotype17 and these individ-
uals more frequently carry a splice site or missense muta-
tion spread over the entire NF1 coding region.18–20 So far,
no single mutation has been correlated with this severe
clinical presentation. We provide the speciﬁc genotype-
phenotype association between a particular NF1 mutation
and the spinal phenotype. Individuals with missense
mutations at p.Gly848 appear to constitute a distinct
group of NF1-affected individuals with a high prevalence
of symptomatic spinal neuroﬁbromas and a clear decrease
of pigmentary manifestations
(CALMs and skinfold
freckles) as well as cutaneous neuroﬁbromas (Tables 2
and S9). Because of the limited number of individuals
R9 years old with the missense mutations at codons
844–846, it is still difﬁcult to establish a genotype-pheno-
type correlation among these cohorts; however, so far
these variants also seem to be associated with a severe
phenotype,
including a high prevalence of plexiform
neuroﬁbromas in the p.Cys845 and p.Ala846 cohorts
(57.1% and 66.7%, respectively) and OPGs in p.Leu844
cohort (24% for both symptomatic and asymptomatic
OPGs in R5 years). At this moment, it cannot be excluded
that two speciﬁc genotype-phenotype correlations exist
within this small region of NF1 with the NF1 codon 847
associated with an increased risk for malignant neoplasia
and the NF1 codon 848 associated with a high prevalence
of symptomatic spinal neuroﬁbromas. The current study,
however,
intended to show that the whole region of
844–848 codons stood out due to its high frequency of

cating functional importance. In addition, the cluster of

outside the GRD important for RAS regulation, is clearly

the current

As NF1 is known for its variable expressivity and age de-
pendency, it is challenging to establish genotype-pheno-
type correlations. Although we performed a comparative
analysis on a large well-described cohort using a standard-
ized phenotypic data collection form, one limitation of the
study is that clinical information was collected by physi-
cians from different referral centers, although all were
NF1 specialists. Data in this and the previously reported
p.Arg1809 cohort were ‘‘double-checked’’ through veriﬁca-
tion of the originally submitted phenotypic checklist
forms and subsequent update of the clinical notes, so
data should be highly accurate.

Clinical variability, both inter- and intrafamilial, has
two decades.72–74
been widely reported in the past
Although signiﬁcant progress has been made over the
last 20 years, the mechanisms underlying this phenotypic
heterogeneity only gradually start to be unraveled. The
factors contributing to the phenotypic variability include
(1) age dependency of some of the NF1 features,29,75,76
(2) timing, cell of origin, and number of second hits in
speciﬁc cells, resulting in presence and number of CALMs,
freckling,
tibial dysplasia, neuroﬁbromas, and other
tumors,77 (3) post-zygotic mosaicism for the ﬁrst NF1 hit
in mosaic individuals,77 (4) the enormous NF1 allelic het-
erogeneity,78 (5) occasional presence of two different NF1
pathogenic variants segregating within a family (see MAD-
R9.232; Table S1 and Figure S5) or the occurrence of two
independent mutations, one in NF1 and the other in a
different gene, within an individual
(see UAB-R624
with the NF1/PTPN11 mutations and UF-R1 with the
NF1/KIT mutations; Table S1), (6) modifying genes,79
and (7) environmental factors (e.g., number of pregnan-
cies).80 To date, two studies have identiﬁed potential
modifying genes, unlinked to the NF1 locus, associated
with the severity of NF1 presentation.81,82 Pasmant et al.
demonstrated that a high number of plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas has been signiﬁcantly associated with allele T

(rs4660761 and rs7161), located between DPH2 (MIM:

rs1800934 in MSH6 (MIM: 600678) with the number of
CALMs.82 Further studies are needed to conﬁrm these
ﬁndings.

reported a correlation of

Missense mutations affecting NF1 codons 844–848
described in this study are clearly pathogenic and individ-
uals with these missense mutations have a statistically

tumor-suppressor

higher risk of developing spinal neuroﬁbromas, plexiform
neuroﬁbromas, and OPGs. Functional studies in mutant
mice harboring the missense mutation c.2542G>C
(p.Gly848Arg) did not recapitulate this human pheno-
type, as neither optic pathway gliomas nor plexiform
neuroﬁbromas developed.22,23 Western blot analysis
showed that c.2542G>C (p.Gly848Arg) resulted in 38%–
50% reduction of neuroﬁbromin levels.22,23 These muta-
tions reside outside the GRD (amino acids 1,217–1,511),
known to have
activity through
downregulation of members of the Ras family of small
GTP-binding proteins. Although NF1 was cloned in 1990,
the cellular functions performed by this huge 2,818-amino
acid multi-domain protein are still incompletely under-
stood. The cluster of
recurrent missense mutations
involving aa 844–848 described in the current study are
located within the CSRD (amino acids 543–909), located
N-terminal to the GRD. The CSRD domain, originally
described by Fahsold et al.,83 is likely functionally impor-
tant, which is further implied by the presence of multiple
missense variants in this segment of the gene in NF1-
affected individuals. The 3D structure of this region has
not been resolved and its precise functions and interactors
have not been described. Ras GAP activity is enhanced
through phosphorylation by Protein Kinase Ca of serine
and threonine residues within this domain.84 Based on
the 2D modeling of
the CSRD using PredictProtein
server,85 the region 831–847 might form the C-part of a he-
lix and be buried in the protein. Missense mutations
affecting codons 844–848, especially those substituting
smaller hydrophobic amino acids to large ones, may result
in breaking of the helix and exposure of the buried protein
domain, consequently affecting the function of the pro-
tein. No functional studies conﬁrming the aforementioned
bioinformatics analysis have been performed, however. In
any case, missense mutations in this region seem to act
through a loss-of-function mechanism and not gain-of-
function or dominant-negative, at least in melanocytes
and JMML. Indeed, the c.2540T>C (p.Leu847Pro) was
observed as a ‘‘second hit’’ in one CALM, biopsied from a
13.5-year-old girl with >5 CALMs and skinfold freckling
carrying the NF1 constitutional mutation c.5547 1G>A
(Table S11), conﬁrming that two hits are required to cause
a phenotypic effect. Additionally, we reported a 5-year-old
girl with JMML (UAB-R9493; Table S1) who carried two
pathogenic NF1 mutations in the blood: c.2542G>A
(p.Gly848Arg) as a ‘‘ﬁrst hit’’ mutation and c.1246C>T
(p.Arg416*) as a ‘‘second hit.’’ There is a need to improve
our understanding of the physiological functions of neuro-
ﬁbromin and to determine how each domain regulates the
function of this protein.

Six amino acids in the region aa 804–950 are evolution-
arily conserved down to yeast (IRA1 and IRA2), Leu844,
Gly849,

(Figure S6) and would therefore be expected to be of
importance.86 Only Leu844 and

individuals to predispose to recurrent missense mutations
(HGMD, LOVD, ClinVar, and our cohort). The tumori-
genic potential of aa 844 is further highlighted by identi-
ﬁcation of somatic mutations in the COSMIC database:
one glioma with c.2531T>C (p.Leu844Pro), one glioma
and four malignant melanomas with c.2530C>T
(p.Leu844Phe).

Palindromic structures belong to the non-B DNA struc-
tures and are often the site of replication errors resulting
in substitutions.87 The NF1 missense mutation hotspot
(aa 844–848) is located in the highly conserved amino
acid region, suggesting that it is functionally important.
The genomic sequence encoding the human NF1 aa
845–853 is a part of
two palindromic structures
(Figure S7); therefore the high rate of recurrent missense
mutations affecting Leu847 and Gly848 may partially be
due these being both located in the loop of
the
palindrome. In NF1 exon 21 [16], other palindromic
nucleotide sequences, specifying the amino acid residues
aa 828–832, aa 865–868, aa 908–911, and aa 933–937 are
observed, resulting in four additional stem-loop struc-
tures. However, these structures do not predispose to
recurrent missense mutations as none were found either
in the UAB, HGMD, or LOVD cohort, except
for
c.2798T>C (p.Leu933Pro), whose location does not
include the loop of
the palindrome. The complex
interplay between functional signiﬁcance and genomic
architecture needs to be considered when analyzing the
recurrence of mutations.

Identiﬁcation

Although only a few clear genotype-phenotype correla-
tions have been so far reported,11–14 the data presented
here show that additional clinically relevant NF1 geno-
type-phenotype correlations exist. A renewed interest in
such studies is needed to come to a timely unfolding of
additional correlations, as so far only the surface has
been scratched. This will require close collaboration be-
tween NF1 clinicians and molecular geneticists. The lack
of discovery of more
speciﬁc genotype-phenotype
correlations may be partly due to the methodological
approach, including lumping mutations in large cate-
gories (truncating versus microdeletion, splice, missense
mutations).88,89
of mutation-speciﬁc
genotype-phenotype correlations depends on the dataset
size with a large number of individuals, preferentially
postpubertal, carrying the same non-truncating constitu-
tional mutation, with the associated phenotype recorded
in a standardized way. As there are only a limited number
of truly recurrent non-truncating mutations, prioritiza-
tion on individuals carrying such recurrent mutations is
indicated. Although each of
the recurrent mutation
affects only a small percentage of NF1-affected individuals
(3%–8% with the microdeletion type I, 0.8% with
p.Met992del, 1.2% with the p.Arg1809 missense muta-
tion, and 0.8% for the cluster of missense mutations
affecting codons 844–848), together they may affect
counseling and surveillance in a signiﬁcant fraction of
the NF1-affected population.

In conclusion,

the present ﬁndings

indicate that
missense mutations affecting one of ﬁve neighboring
codons 844–848 located outside the GAP-related domain
are an important risk factor for a severe phenotype in
NF1-affected individuals. We report that these individuals
have a high prevalence of plexiform and/or spinal neuro-
ﬁbromas, symptomatic and asymptomatic OPGs, malig-
nant neoplasms, and skeletal abnormalities. A severe
phenotype was observed in 75% of adult NF1-affected
individuals with these mutations, clearly demonstrating
that missense mutations outside the GRD can be
associated with a severe clinical presentation. The current
study identiﬁed a genotype-phenotype correlation in this
region that may be valuable in the management and
genetic counseling of a signiﬁcant number of NF1-affected
individuals. These data suggest that there is a potential
need for increased disease surveillance in individuals
with these mutations enabling genotype-driven personal-
ized medicine.
