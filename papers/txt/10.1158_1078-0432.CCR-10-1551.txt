Abstract

Purpose: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are highly aggressive sarcomas with
variable patient survival and few known prognostically relevant genomic biomarkers. To identify survival-
associated genomic biomarkers, we performed high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybri-
dization (aCGH) on a large set of MPNSTs.

Experimental Design: Candidate gene alterations identified by aCGH in 38 MPNSTs were validated
at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels on these same tumors and an independent set of 87 MPNST
specimens.

Results: aCGH revealed highly complex copy number alterations, including both previously reported
and completely novel loci. Four regions of copy number gain were associated with poor patient survival.
Candidate genes in these regions include SOX5 (12p12.1), NOL1 and MLF2 (12p13.31), FOXM1 and
FKBP1 (12p13.33), and CDK4 and TSPAN31 (12q14.1). Alterations of these candidate genes and several
others of interest (ERBB2, MYC and TP53) were confirmed by at least 1 complementary methodology,
including DNA and mRNA quantitative real-time PCR, mRNA expression profiling, and tissue microarray-
based fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Multivariate analysis showed that
CDK4 gain/amplification and increased FOXM1 protein expression were the most significant independent
predictors for poor survival in MPNST patients (P < 0.05).

Conclusions: Our study provides new and independently confirmed candidate genes that could
serve as genomic biomarkers for overall survival in MPNST patients. Clin Cancer Res; 17(7); 1924–34.

Introduction

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are
highly aggressive and frequently lethal Schwann cell-
derived neoplasms associated with poor survival (1–5).
Roughly half of MPNSTs develop sporadically and the
other half arise in the setting of neurofibromatosis type
1 (NF1). The 5-year survival rate for NF1-associated MPNST
patients is reportedly half of that for sporadic cases (21%
vs. 42%; ref 5). However, other studies suggest that a
diagnosis of NF1 does not affect survival (6). Clinicopatho-
logic factors, such as tumor grade and anatomic site report-
edly influence MPNST patient outcome, although the
clinical course remains highly variable and difficult to
predict in individual patients.

Traditional cytogenetic studies have reported that
MPNSTs have remarkably complex karyotypes with a wide
spectrum of chromosomal alterations including transloca-
tions, duplications, and numerical gains and losses, making
it difficult to discern which of these alterations are biolo-
gically relevant (7–9). Unfortunately, no single alteration

Translational Relevance

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is
an aggressive malignancy with considerable biological
variability, a variable and often lethal clinical course, and
limited response to current therapeutic approaches. A
major impediment to more effective disease management
has been a lack of available prognostic or predictive
biomarkers. Through initial identification of several sur-
vival-associated copy number alterations, followed by
confirmatory assays and a comprehensive multivariate
analysis, our present study demonstrates that CDK4
gain/amplification and increased FOXM1 protein expres-
sion are significant independent predictors for poor sur-
vival in MPNST patients. If confirmed in additional
prospective studies, these biomarkers may provide clini-
cally useful information for managing patients with this
aggressive malignancy. Interestingly, a previous report
has demonstrated that the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafe-
nib can inhibit MPNST growth, suggesting the potential
of CDK4 as a therapeutic target and also as a potential
predictive biomarker of response to sorafenib therapy.

has consistently proven to be diagnostically or prognosti-
cally useful across multiple studies. For example, alterations
on chromosome 17 (where the NF1 gene is located) are
expected, given that MPNSTs are highly over-represented
among NF1 patients. However, NF1 losses are not always
encountered (8–10), suggesting that other tumorigenic
pathways also exist. A major limitation of traditional cyto-
genetic studies, however, has been their limited resolution
of 10 Mb. This has complicated the discovery of specific,
recurring genetic alterations involving small regions.

High-resolution genome-wide DNA microarray analyses
have identified many novel tumor-specific microdeletions
and amplifications in leukemia, lung, and ovarian cancers
(11–13). To date, a similar approach applied to MPNSTs
has been limited to few studies with either less compre-
hensive or lower resolution array platforms (1 Mb; refs
14–16). In the present study, we have analyzed a larger
cohort of MPNSTs utilizing both Affymetrix and Nimble-
gen array-based comparative
genome hybridization
(aCGH) platforms (0.25–2.5 kb of resolution with whole
genome coverage) to identify recurrent DNA copy number
alterations (CNA) that are associated with reduced patient
survival, independent of traditional clinical and patholo-
gical parameters in patients with this extremely heteroge-
neous tumor. The results from this study provide a short list
of candidate genes with CNAs which may prove clinically
useful as prognostic biomarkers for patients with MPNST.

Materials and Methods

Patients and specimens

A cohort of 38 patients with histologically confirmed
MPNST was included in this study for microarray analysis.

Genomic Biomarkers and Survival in MPNST

Among the 38 patients, 23 (60%) individuals carried a
previous diagnosis of NF1 and 15 (40%) were sporadic
cases. At the time of last follow-up, 14 (37%) cases had
documented metastases, whereas 16 (42%) had no evi-
dence of metastatic disease. Recurrence data were unavail-
able for 8 of the cases. The majority (33/38) of cases
subjected to genomic analysis was primary tumors,
although 5 cases of recurrent tumors were also included.
A full accounting of clinical and pathological data is
provided in Supplemental Table T1. DNAs and RNAs
were extracted from frozen tumors, using commercial
reagents (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit, Qiagen; Trizol reagent,
Invitrogen) and following manufacturers’ standard pro-
tocols. These same specimens were previously utilized
for gene expression profiling (17). For biomarker valida-
tion studies, another independent set of 121 formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded MPNST tumors represented in
a tissue microarray (TMA) was utilized; 87 of
these
patients had clinical annotation and follow-up data
(18). Of these 87 annotated cases, 25 (29%) were NF1-
associated and 62 (71%) were sporadic MPNSTs. A total
of 68 primary, 12 locally recurrent, and 7 metastatic
tumors were represented. The majority of the tumors
(78/87) were high grade and 9/87 were classified as low
grade. Supplemental Table T2 provides additional data
regarding the validation set. All tissue specimens and
clinical data from these patients were collected and uti-
lized in accordance with Institutional Review Board–
approved protocols.

Array-based comparative genome hybridization

The Affymetrix Genome-Wide 500K SNP Mapping
array set was employed to detect genomic alterations
in the set of 38 MPNSTs. For aCGH analysis, relative
copy number values of the MPNSTs were generated using
a reference set of 37 nonmalignant DNA samples derived
from 22 males and 15 females. To identify meaningful
CNAs, 2 DNA copy number analysis tools, Partek Geno-
mics Suite (PARTEK, www.partek.com) and Copy Num-
ber Analyzer for GeneChip (CNAG, www.genome.umin.
jp; ref 19) were applied to the aCGH data. CNAs identi-
fied with each of the 2 tools were compared with identify
recurrent regions with minimal overlap. Physical posi-
tions of CNAs were annotated according to human gen-
ome build 35 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). All CNAs were
filtered against the human normal copy number varia-
tion (CNV) database (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation)
prior to further analysis. CNAs identified on the 500K
SNP platform were also confirmed in a subset of 8
patients where patient-matched tumor and germline
DNAs were available, using a dual-color high-density
NimbleGen 135K aCGH platform (see Supplemental
Text for details).

Quantitative real-time PCR

SYBR Green chemistry was utilized in quantitative real-
time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays; qRT-PCR primer sequences
are listed in Supplemental Table T3. The qRT-PCR was

Immunohistochemistry

Fresh TMA sections were obtained from the Washing-
ton University/Siteman Cancer Center Tissue Procure-
ment Core Facility, and immunohistochemistry (IHC)
was performed using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex technique as described previously (21). The
primary antibodies included FOXM1 (Santa Cruz; Cat.
#: sc-502; 1:200 dilution), MYC (Zymed; Cat. #: 9E10;
1:200 dilution), SOX5 (Abcam; Cat. #: ab26041; 1:500
dilution), and p53 (Biogenex; Cat. #: AM240-5M; 1:200
dilution). Evaluation of each core on the TMA was made
independently by 2 pathologists (L.S., A.P.), and the final
score for each tumor was derived from the average score
of replicate cores on the arrays (see Supplemental Text).
CDK4 TMA IHC was also performed, but was not inter-
pretable because of poor staining quality of this antibody
reagent on the TMA spots.

FISH

FISH was performed on TMA slides as previously
described (22, 23). Freshly cut slides were subjected to
dual-color hybridization with the following probe pair-
ings: centromere enumerating probe 12 (CEP12)/CDK4
(12q14.1), CEP17/HER2 (ERBB2; 17q21.1), and CEP8/
MYC (8q24.21), respectively. Five of the probes were
obtained commercially and were labeled with Spectrum-
Green (CEP8, CEP12, and CEP17) or SpectrumOrange
(MYC and ERBB2) fluorochromes (Vysis). The CDK4
locus was targeted with a locally developed probe, utiliz-
ing the RP11-571M6 human BAC clone as previously
published (24; see Supplemental Text).

Statistical analysis

Each of the minimally overlapping genomic regions
was tested for association with clinical variables, for which
the Kaplan–Meier model was used for survival analysis.
Differential expression of candidate genes was detected
between patients with and without CNAs where positive
correlations with survival were seen using the Mann–
Whitney U test. Survival probability was first estimated
using the Breslow test (univariate Cox regression) for each
of the genomic and relevant clinical variables, and then
the significant predictors
in univariate models were
entered into multivariate models. The stepwise selection
method was utilized to build the most significant models.
The cut-off P value was set as 0.05. All computations were
performed in SAS (v9.1.3).

quantified by calculation of
index"
(a surrogate measure of genomic instability calculated
based upon the total number of independently amplified
and deleted genomic segments identified in a tumor
based on aCGH analysis, see ref. 13), MPNSTs demon-
strate a highly complex and disrupted genome. MPNST
genomes had higher overall complexity (mean "break-
point index" ¼ 346) compared with similarly character-
ized genomes of other tumor types: leukemia (mean ¼
88; ref 25), ovarian cancer (median ¼ 95; ref 13), and
pilocytic astrocytoma (mean ¼ 111; ref 20). The indices
were, however, similar to lymphoma (mean ¼ 374; ref
26). The percentage of the total genome affected by
CNAs was also calculated to assess genome complexity
of individual tumors. This ranged widely from 0.2% to
97% (median 34%) among the 38 MPNSTs (Fig. 1C). This
observation no doubt reflects the pathological diversity
of tumors characterized in this cohort, although a direct
association between reduced survival time and overall
high genome complexity (defined here as  34% of the
genome affected by CNA) did not quite reach statistical
significance (Fig. 2A, P ¼ 0.071).

Many of the genomic loci associated with recurrent
CNAs harbor genes previously implicated in MPNST bio-
logy and were observed with frequencies comparable to
those reported in previous studies (14; Supplemental
Table T4). For example, 19 of 38 (50%) cases had deletion
at the NF1 locus. Interestingly, however, this event was
independent of clinical diagnosis as 13 of 23 NF1 patients
(56%) as well as 6 of 15 sporadic cases (40%) demon-
strated deletions. Several other recurrent CNAs of genes
not previously associated with MPNSTs were also identi-
fied. These included gains of PDCD1 at 2p25.3 (47% of
cases), SOX5 at 12p12.1 (34% of cases), FOXM1 at
12p13.33 (29% of cases), and NOL1 at 12p13.31 (29%
of cases) as well as losses of PSIP1/p75 at 9p22.3 (50% of
cases; ref 27), PTPRD at 9p23 to 9p24.1 (47% of cases; ref
28), and PTEN at 10q23.31 (34% cases). Although it is
likely that NF1-associated and sporadic MPNSTs arise in
the context of different genetic backgrounds, we found that
none of these nor any other loci identified in this analysis
was present with statistical significance between NF1-asso-
ciated and sporadic MPNSTs.

Identification of survival-associated genomic
alterations

Minimally overlapping regions of genome alteration
(1,564 copy number gains and 252 copy number losses)
identified using 2 alternate segment calling algorithms
were correlated with clinical variables. Each genome
region evaluated contained at least 1 annotated gene
and recurred in greater than 10% of 38 tumors. A detec-
tion frequency of 10% (4 tumors) was chosen as a mini-
mum cut-off to provide sufficient statistical power given

the sample size and recognizing the already extreme
diversity of this tumor type. Using either Mann–Whitney
U test or chi-square test, no significant association was
observed between these regions and clinical variables
such as age, gender, tumor status (i.e., primary or recur-
rent), anatomic location and grade, metastasis, recur-
rence, or NF1 association. Using the Kaplan–Meier
model, however, 36 minimally overlapping regions with
copy number gains demonstrated significant associations
with decreased survival times (Supplemental Table T5).

No regions with copy number losses were statistically
associated with patient survival.

When ranked by both frequency and P value, the most
significant region of copy number gain was a 173 kb
minimally overlapping region at 12p12.1 that includes
only a portion of the SOX5 gene (Fig. 2B). This region
demonstrated copy number gains in 13 tumors, but with
variability in the size of the locus affected (Fig. 3A). Three
other genomic regions associated with survival were also
identified (Fig. 2C and E), where differential mRNA expres-

sion was seen in at least 1 overlapping gene for each of the
regions, based on previously published expression profil-
ing data of the same tumors (Table 1; ref 17). The sizes of
these 3 regions were 265 kb at 12p13.31, 551 kb at

Confirmation of copy number alterations associated
with survival

To confirm results obtained from aCGH data sets, qRT-
PCR was performed to quantify DNA copy number for 7
specific candidate genes using the same 38 MPNST DNAs
employed for aCGH analysis. DNA qRT-PCR results con-

firmed associations between decreased survival and DNA
copy number gains for all 7 genes (Table 1). Using the same
MPNST RNAs from our previously reported gene expres-
sion microarray study (17), qRT-PCR analysis confirmed
differential expression for 5 of the 7 genes (NOL1, MLF2,
FOXM1, FKBP4, and CDK4), whereas SOX5 and TSPAN31
showed no differential expression (Table 1). Given that
only a portion of the SOX5 gene was involved in the
amplified region, we questioned whether this amplifica-
tion reflected a qualitative rearrangement of the locus,
rather than SOX5 amplification. However, sequencing of
RNAs from tumors that exhibited SOX5 amplification

independent predictors

Finally, a multivariate analysis was carried out to deter-
mine whether any of the genomic biomarkers identified
could serve as
survival
(Table 2). Among all genomic and clinical variables
examined, only 4 CNA regions (representatively named
as CDK4, FOXM1, NOL1, and SOX5) and anatomic site
(Fig. 2F) showed significant associations with survival
time by univariate regression analysis in the 38 MPNSTs.
In addition, CDK4 gene amplification by FISH analysis,
FOXM1 and MYC protein expression, tumor type (i.e.,
primary, recurrent, or metastatic; Fig. 2K) and tumor
grade (Fig. 2L) also demonstrated statistically significant
association with overall survival. In multivariate analysis,
however,
the most significant survival predictor was
CDK4 copy number gain by aCGH in the 38 patient
cohort and corresponding CDK4 gene amplification by
FISH in the 87-patient cohort. Tumor anatomic site in the
38 patient cohort, and high FOXM1 protein expression
and tumor type in the 87-patient cohort were also inde-
pendently significant in multivariate analyses.

Discussion

MPNST is an aggressive malignancy with considerable
biological variability and limited response to current ther-
apeutic approaches. This phenomenon is well demon-
strated by the clinical heterogeneity of patient outcome
in the current study, with overall survival ranging from less
than a month to over 13 years. A major impediment to
more effective disease management has been a lack of
available prognostic or predictive biomarkers. While other
sarcomas exhibit characteristic translocations that lead to
signature fusion transcripts (29), a definitive set of clini-
cally relevant genomic alterations has been difficult to
identify for MPNST, likely because of the large number
of gross structural genomic aberrations identified in indi-
vidual tumors.

Our current study provides one of the first global, high-
resolution genomic views of MPNST with independent
validation of several biologically relevant genes. Not sur-
prisingly, the overall level of genomic complexity is higher
than previously observed by conventional cytogenetic ana-
lyses. Identifying the presumably small number of biolo-
gically relevant genomic alterations among a large number
of secondary changes resulting from genomic instability
remains a daunting task. For this reason, it was reassuring
that analysis of these highly complex data sets nevertheless
identified a number of loci already known to be important
in MPNST tumorigenesis and malignant progression. These
included losses of NF1 on 17q11.2 and CDKN2A on 9p21,
as well as common gains on 7p, 8q, 12, and 17q. However,
a relatively larger sample size, the use of a high-resolution
genomic platform, and correlation with clinical follow-up
data in this study identified a number of novel genes whose
copy number gain could serve as clinically useful prognos-
tic markers. In contrast to single gene, high-level amplifica-

tion that is seen at MYC and EGFR loci in some tumor
types, aCGH analysis typically identifies larger genomic
regions exhibiting more subtle copy number increases. This
may be attributed to both the limited dynamic range of
microarray-based technology as well as biological hetero-
geneity of the tumors themselves.

Interestingly, some of the genome CNAs that we identi-
fied by aCGH were discordant when measured at the level
of gene transcription and/or protein expression. For exam-
ple, SOX5 copy number gains were associated with dimin-
ished survival times, but increased mRNA and protein
levels were not. There are a number of explanations for
such discrepancies, including the possibility of transloca-
tions that result in biologically meaningful alterations
unassociated with increased expression. Although sequen-
cing of SOX5 transcripts in tumors with amplification at
this locus was performed in this study, our inability to
identify chimeric transcripts by this targeted sequencing
approach does not entirely exclude this possibility. Con-
versely, while MYC protein and RNA expression levels
correlated with survival, we did not observe a similar
relationship at the genome level, as determined by either
FISH or aCGH. This suggests that mechanisms of increased
expression at the transcriptional level may be more impor-
tant for this particular gene. These repeated observations
underscore the need for a comprehensive evaluation of all
candidate biomarkers at the genome, transcriptome, and
protein levels in independent sample sets, particularly as
they are being considered as prognostic tools.

For example, in the recent literature, p53 expression has
been proposed as an important predictor of survival time in
MPNST patients (30, 31). Our data, however, did not
confirm this finding at the level of protein expression, gene
expression, or genome deletion. Although 50% of MPNSTs
had deletions at the TP53 locus in our present study,
differential mRNA expression between TP53 deleted and
nondeleted tumors was not seen (P > 0.05) and TP53
deletion itself did not stratify MPNST patients by survival.
Furthermore, in the second cohort of 87 MPNSTs, p53
immunoreactivity was not statistically associated with sur-
vival time. One reason for this discrepancy between our
current study and previous studies could reflect the pre-
sence of p53 substitution mutations that would obviously
not be detected by aCGH but that could affect protein
expression and stability. However, the analytical and inter-
pretive techniques applied to IHC in the current study were
similar to those of previous reports and as such, this
discrepancy is more difficult to explain. In contrast, we
did identify recurrent copy number gains involving loci at
12p13.31 and 12p13.33 that were associated with survival
on univariate analyses. Although these 2 regions did not
remain statistically significant in our primary cohort of 38
MPNST patients by multivariate analysis, we were able to
subsequently demonstrate concurrent mRNA and protein
overexpression of FOXM1 in this region. In a second larger
cohort of 87 MPNSTs, FOXM1 over-expression by IHC was
associated with poor survival, a significance which was
retained on multivariate analysis. FOXM1 is a transcription

factor that is only expressed in proliferating cells and has
critical functions in tumor development and progression
(32, 33). Expression has been associated with enhanced
invasion and metastasis in pancreatic and prostate cancers
(32, 34). Increased expression of FOXM1 also correlates
with increased tumorigenicity of cultured glioma cells and
in human glioblastomas, its expression levels are inversely
correlated with patient survival (35). Our current data
suggest that increased FOXM1 protein expression is a
significant predictor of poor survival in MPNST patients.
Finally, of the numerous candidate loci and genes
identified in this study, CDK4 appears to be the most
clinically and biologically significant. This gene was initi-
ally identified as a region at 12q14.1 that demonstrated
recurrent copy number gains associated with patient
survival. Of the 12 genes within this locus, only CDK4
demonstrated concordant copy number gains and mRNA
overexpression by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, by FISH ana-
lysis in an independent patient cohort, we found a sig-
nificant association between CDK4 amplification (15% of
tumors) and decreased survival in a multivariate analysis.
Studies have demonstrated amplification of the CDK4
region in many human cancers (36–38), a finding vari-
ably associated with tumorigenesis and/or survival. This
12q amplicon has long been recognized for its role in
sarcoma tumorigenesis. Interestingly, however, in con-
trast to what has been reported in dedifferentiated lipo-
sarcoma (39), MDM2 coamplification with CDK4 was
uncommon in MPNSTs analyzed in this study. To our
knowledge, our study is the first to provide specific

evidence for a significant association between CDK4
amplification and poor patient survival in MPNSTs. Inter-
estingly, a previous report has demonstrated that the
multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib can inhibit MPNST
growth, in part through hypophosphorylation of pRB
at CDK4-specific sites (40), suggesting the potential of
CDK4 as a therapeutic target and also as a potential
predictive biomarker of response to sorafenib therapy.

In conclusion, CDK4 gain/amplification and increased
FOXM1 protein expression were the most significant inde-
pendent predictors for poor survival in MPNST patients
after accounting for well established clinicopathologic
prognostic variables in MPNSTs. If confirmed in prospec-
tive studies, these prognostic and potentially predictive
biomarkers may provide clinically useful information for
managing patients with this aggressive malignancy.
