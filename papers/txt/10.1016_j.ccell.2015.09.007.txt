SUMMARY

A central question in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) research is the identity of the tumor-initiating cell, and its
contribution to the malignant phenotype and genomic state. We examine the potential of adult lineage-
restricted progenitors to induce fully penetrant GBM using CNS progenitor-speciﬁc inducible Cre mice to
mutate Nf1, Trp53, and Pten. We identify two phenotypically and molecularly distinct GBM subtypes gov-
erned by identical driver mutations. We demonstrate that the two subtypes arise from functionally indepen-
dent pools of adult CNS progenitors. Despite histologic identity as GBM, these tumor types are separable
based on the lineage of the tumor-initiating cell. These studies point to the cell of origin as a major determi-
nant of GBM subtype diversity.

INTRODUCTION

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains one of the most lethal
forms of adult human cancer, with a median survival of approx-
imately 1 year from time of diagnosis (Stupp et al., 2005; Wen
and Kesari, 2008). Its invasive and rapidly progressive nature
has prompted numerous studies on the origins of these highly
malignant tumors. Traditionally, the concept that cancer can
spontaneously develop from any or most somatic cells was
widely accepted and GBM was thought to be derived from as-
trocytes (Sanai et al., 2005). Given the need for accumulation of
multiple mutations, the unlimited self-renewal potential of stem
cells would more easily allow such events during the lifetime of
an individual, making them more accessible targets for malig-
nant transformation (Chen et al., 2012b; Reya et al., 2001).
Accordingly, adult stem cells exhibit tumor-initiating potential
in animal models of leukemia, breast, lung, colon, and other

organ cancers (Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009; Sell, 2010; Vis-
vader, 2011). In the brain, direct or indirect targeting of the tu-
mor suppressors Nf1, Trp53, and Pten in adult mouse neural
stem cells induces high-grade gliomas that faithfully pheno-
copy the human malignancy (Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009;
Chen et al., 2012a; Jacques et al., 2010). In the experimental
setting,
the transformation of more mature neural cells to
form tumors has been reported. However, how such a manip-
ulation could relate to the physiological setting of gradually
accumulating mutations is less clear
(Friedmann-Morvinski
et al., 2012).

The role of adult lineage-restricted progenitors in solid tumor
etiology is not well characterized. Unlike multipotent stem cells,
most progenitors have limited self-renewal and are fated to
differentiate into postmitotic cells that present impediments to
transformation (Huntly et al., 2004; Lillien, 1998). In hematologic
malignancies,
it has been shown that leukemias can arise

Signiﬁcance

The cell of origin, including the role of adult lineage-restricted progenitors in glioblastoma, is an area of ongoing controversy.
Emerging human genomic data have been used to stratify GBM into subgroups. Identiﬁcation of the CNS cell lineages that
contribute to GBM using cell type-speciﬁc mouse models provides unique insight into mechanisms of tumor initiation and
progression. Our ﬁndings showing different adult CNS progenitors as GBM-initiating cells and the cell of origin as a major
driver of tumor subtype has important implications for functional subclassiﬁcation of GBM and identiﬁcation of subtype
relevant target pathways.

from stem cells, myeloid, and lymphoid progenitors (Krivtsov
et al., 2006). Some oncogenes, such as MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-
AF9, but not BCR-ABL, transform committed hematopoietic
progenitors and confer properties of stem cells, like enhanced
self-renewal (Huntly et al., 2004). Other studies indicate that
initiating mutations in stem cells can create leukemia of
committed progenitor phenotype, indicating that progenitors
can be important cellular
leukemia (Cozzio
et al., 2003). How these scenarios play out in the case of gli-
omas is not known.

incubators of

In mature rodent brain, new neurons are continually produced
in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and
the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (Alvarez-Buylla
and Lim, 2004; Zhao et al., 2008). In the SVZ and SGZ, neural
stem cells (NSCs) are relatively quiescent, glial ﬁbrillary acidic
protein (Gfap)-expressing cells that exhibit lifelong self-renewal
potential and generate neural progenitor cells (NPCs) whose
fate and terminal differentiation are rapidly achieved. NPCs are
transit-amplifying cells that typically undergo several rounds of
cell division before forming new neurons that migrate either
from the SVZ through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and
into the olfactory bulb (OB) or locally within the dentate gyrus
(Doetsch et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2008). Oligodendrocyte pro-
genitor cells (OPCs), on the other hand, are broadly arrayed in
the adult brain, where they constitute the largest pool of dividing
cells. These cells are responsible for generating myelin-forming
oligodendrocytes in the developing and mature CNS, and are
the source of myelin-forming cells following demyelinating le-
sions (Nishiyama et al., 2009).

To speciﬁcally target discrete adult progenitor populations in
the brain, we used Cre transgenic mice that drive recombination
in different adult CNS cell types. Speciﬁc regulatory elements of
the rat Nestin gene have been harnessed to specify transgene
expression to adult neural stem cells of the SVZ and SGZ (Alcan-
tara Llaguno et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009, 2012a); regulatory
elements of
the mouse Ascl1 (Achaete-scute family bHLH
transcription factor 1; also known as Mash1) gene direct recom-
bination speciﬁcally in the SVZ and SGZ adult committed neural
progenitor lineage and adult OPCs (Kim et al., 2007, 2008); and
those of the mouse Cspg4 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4)
gene, which encodes for NG2, are speciﬁc for OPCs in the adult
mouse brain (Zhu et al., 2011). In this study, we investigate the

role of adult neural and oligodendrocyte progenitors in the devel-
opment of GBM.

RESULTS

We previously identiﬁed adult SVZ neural stem cells as an efﬁ-
cient source of gliomas in mouse models caused by inactivation
of Nf1, Trp53, and Pten, three of the most commonly mutated
genes in human GBM (Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009; Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008). To speciﬁcally target
adult lineage-restricted CNS progenitors to the exclusion of
stem cells, we turned to a transgenic mouse line that expresses
tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of Ascl1
regulatory elements (Kim et al., 2007, 2008; Mich et al., 2014).
Using the Ascl1-creERTM;R26-stop-lacZ reporter, X-gal staining
of tamoxifen-treated mouse brains veriﬁed speciﬁc recombina-
tion in the SVZ-RMS-OB and the SGZ at 2 weeks post-induction
(Figure S1A). LacZ+ cells were also found in white matter and
subcortical gray matter regions,
including corpus callosum,
hypothalamus and thalamic regions, where OPCs and their
progeny are located. Immunostaining of Ascl1-creERTM;R26-
stop-YFP reporter brains showed colocalization of the YFP
signal with markers for adult neural and oligodendrocyte line-
ages (Figures 1A and S1B). YFP co-localized with neural stem
and progenitor markers Sox2 and Nestin but not the stem cell-
speciﬁc marker Gfap in the SVZ and SGZ (Alvarez-Buylla and
Lim, 2004; Zhao et al., 2008). YFP also co-stained with the imma-
ture neuronal marker doublecortin (Dcx) and the mature neuronal
marker NeuN in the RMS-OB and the dentate gyrus, as well
as the OPC marker Olig2 and mature oligodendrocyte marker
APC in OPC regions such as the thalamus. These data conﬁrm
the expression of the Ascl1-creERTM transgene in a subset
of adult CNS progenitors and their derivatives, but not in stem
cells.

Adult Lineage-Restricted CNS Progenitors Produce
Glioma
To determine whether
tumor suppressor deletion in adult
committed progenitors also efﬁciently generates malignant
gliomas, we bred Ascl1-creERTM mice to incorporate condi-
tional and/or null alleles of Nf1, Trp53, and Pten to yield
the following genotypes: Ascl1-creERTM;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;Trp53ﬂox/ﬂox

tants and controls were induced with tamoxifen or vehicle at
4 weeks of age. AscNP and AscNPP mice showed accelerated
morbidity (Figure 1B). Furthermore, one or two tamoxifen doses
had similar tumor kinetics and median survival in AscNP mice,
suggesting saturation of recombination efﬁciency (Figure 1C).

Analysis of symptomatic AscNP and AscNPP mice demon-
strated malignant gliomas (Figures 1D and 1E). H&E staining
showed the classical features of diffusely inﬁltrating high-grade
gliomas (Figure 1D), with indistinct tumor borders (Figure 1De),
pseudopalisading necrosis (Figure 1Dg), and prominent mitoses
(Figure 1Dh). Control mice (Figures 1Db, Dd, and Df) did not
develop tumors. AscNP and AscNPP tumors were classiﬁed as
grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma) or grade IV (glioblastoma mul-
tiforme) based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁ-
cation system (Louis et al., 2007; Figure 1E). The gliomas were
immunoreactive for the classical markers Ki67, Gfap, Nestin,

and Olig2, as well as progenitor markers Sox2 and platelet-
derived growth factor receptor a (Pdgfra; Figure 1F). Cre-medi-
ated tumor suppressor deletion in AscNP mice was veriﬁed by
genotyping (Figure S1C), and western blot analysis, showing
absence of the Nf1 protein and accumulation of mutant p53 pro-
tein (Figure 1G). These data demonstrate that Nf1, Trp53, and
Pten tumor suppressor inactivation in adult lineage-restricted
progenitor cells is sufﬁcient to induce malignant glioma.

In vivo, AscNP tumor cells undergo multi-lineage differentiation
(Figure 1H). b-galactosidase-positive tumor cells were immuno-
reactive for markers of astrocytes (Gfap; S100b; data not shown),
neurons (NeuN), and oligodendrocytes (myelin basic protein,
Mbp). Freshly dissociated AscNP tumors grown in growth fac-
tor-supplemented, serum-free media produced tumorspheres,
self-renew and undergo multi-lineage differentiation when shifted
to serum-containing media (Figures S1D and S1E). Thus, adult
progenitor-driven gliomas exhibit stem cell-like properties
including self-renewal and multipotency when tested in vitro.

Early Proliferation and Migration Defects in Mutant
Adult CNS Progenitors
To gain insight into the early events in glioma formation, we
analyzed pre-symptomatic AscNP mice. At 1 month post-
tamoxifen induction, no abnormal histology was detected (data
not shown), but at 4 months post-induction, we observed evi-

dence of abnormal proliferation, differentiation, and migration
(Figure 2). X-gal staining of AscNP mutants showed enhanced
staining of recombined lacZ+ cells in the adult neural and oligo-
dendrocyte progenitor regions compared to age-matched con-
trols (Figure 2A). In the SVZ, AscNP mice showed enhanced
Ki67 and Nestin staining, as well as increased short-term BrdU

difference in apoptosis (Figure S2). These data reveal early
migratory and differentiation abnormalities in AscNP adult neural
progenitors.

AscNP OPCs also showed increased lacZ staining (Figure 2A)
and proliferation in short-term BrdU pulse-chases (Figures 2C
and 2F), as well as increased abundance of the OPC marker
Olig2 (Figures 2B, 2C, and 2G). Thus, both mutant adult neural
and oligodendrocytic progenitors exhibit enhanced proliferation,
differentiation, and migration alterations in advance of obvious
tumor formation.

AscNP and NPP Mice Develop Two GBM Variants
Overall, AscNP and AscNPP tumors displayed the classic histo-
pathologic hallmarks of diffuse, inﬁltrating gliomas, primarily
localized to the dorsal brain (telencephalon: cerebral cortex, hip-
pocampus, and caudate putamen; Figure 3A), and similar to the
majority of gliomas derived from the neural stem cell-speciﬁc
Nestin-creERT2 mutant mice (Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009).
Detailed scrutiny, however, revealed a subset of tumors that
generally located to the ventral brain (diencephalon: thalamus
and hypothalamus, and brainstem: midbrain, pons, and medulla;
Figure 3A) and tended to exhibit better-deﬁned tumor borders
(Figures 3B and 3C). Compared to the more prevalent gliomas
identiﬁed in these and previous studies (Alcantara Llaguno
et al., 2009; Kwon et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2005), the variant
GBM subset uniformly showed reduced immunoreactivity for
Gfap and Nestin coupled with enhanced Olig2 and Pdgfra
expression (Figures 3D and 3E). Immunoreactivity to other line-
age markers was similar for both tumor types (Figure S3A).
When dissociated and grown in serum-free, growth factor-sup-
plemented media, both GBM types displayed similar cell viability
(Figure S3B). Hereafter, we refer to the predominant, Gfaphigh
tumors as type 1 gliomas and the less frequent, Gfaplow variant
tumors as type 2 gliomas (Figure 3F).

Type 1 tumors are predominant in AscNPP mice while AscNP
mice develop both tumor types equally (Figure 3G). One possible
explanation may be that the presence of the Pten mutation in
AscNPP elicits faster development of the more inﬁltrative and
aggressive type 1 tumors, thus masking the development of
type 2 variant GBMs. Quantiﬁcation of marker+ cells in tumor
brain sections show increased proliferation (Ki67+) and
decreased apoptosis (Cleaved Caspase 3+) in type 1 compared
to type 2 tumors (Figures 3H and 3I). These features are consis-
tent with two GBM subtypes that exhibit morphologic and
phenotypic differences.

Type 1 and 2 Gliomas Exhibit Characteristic Behavior
In Vivo
We tested whether type 1 and type 2 glioma differences reﬂect
intrinsic tumor cell properties or, alternatively, are inﬂuenced
by microenvironment (anatomic location). We transplanted equal
numbers of early passage AscNP type 1 and type 2 tumor cells
from two independent lines into the dorsal striatum (a common
type 1 site) of immunodeﬁcient mice (Figure 4A). We found that
type 1 tumors confer signiﬁcantly shorter median survival
compared to type 2 tumors, reﬂective of their more aggressive
nature (37 versus 126 days post-transplantation; Figure 4B)
and developed into correspondingly inﬁltrative, Gfaphigh-ex-
pressing gliomas (Figures 4C and 4D). On the other hand, the

We next compared the transcriptional
proﬁles of AscNP tumors with different
CNS cell populations using murine brain
cell type-speciﬁc proﬁles deﬁned by the
Barres group (Cahoy et al., 2008). Unsu-
pervised hierarchical clustering was
applied to the gene expression proﬁles
of AscNP type 1 and type 2 gliomas and
control samples, as well as OPCs, differ-
entiated oligodendrocytes, myelinating
oligodendrocytes (myelin OLs), astro-
cytes, and neurons. Clustering analysis best aligned type 2 tu-
mors with OPCs whereas type 1 gliomas had relatively greater
relatedness to astrocytes (Figure 5E). Taken together, these
data show that type 1 and 2 gliomas are molecularly distinct
and give strength to the hypothesis that they arise from different
cells of origin, reﬂecting the two different progenitor lineages tar-
geted by the Ascl1-creERTM transgene.

Type 2 Gliomas Are Adult OPC-Derived
To directly test the hypothesis that type 2 tumors are derived
from adult OPCs, we used an OPC-speciﬁc NG2-creERTM trans-
gene (Zhu et al., 2011). Immunohistochemical analysis veriﬁed
OPC speciﬁcity, including co-expression of the TdTomato re-
porter with the OPC marker Pdgfra and mature oligodendrocyte
marker APC, but not with NeuN, microglia marker Iba1, or Gfap
(Figure 6A).

ground (NG2-creERTM;Nf1ﬂox/ﬂox;Trp53ﬂox/ﬂox;Ptenﬂox/+ or NG2-
creERTM;Nf1ﬂox/+;Trp53ﬂox/ﬂox;Ptenﬂox/+; NG2NPP), and tamox-
ifen-induced at 4–8 weeks of age, had a median survival of
21.1 weeks (Figure 6B), and developed WHO grade III or IV gli-
omas (Figures 6C–6E). NG2NPP tumors showed histologic and
molecular similarity to the type 2 AscNP and AscNPP tumors
(Figures 6D–6H), including the presence of pseudopalisading ne-
crosis (Figure 6Ea), with low Gfap and Nestin, but high Pdgfra
and Olig2 immunoreactivity (Figures 6F and S4A). As observed
for the type 2 AscNP and AscNPP tumors, more NG2NPP tumors
had better deﬁned tumor borders compared to the more diffuse

Cancer Cell 28, 429–440, October 12, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Inc. 435

transplanted type 2 cells adhered to their original properties,
including relatively lower Gfap and Nestin, and higher Olig2
and Pdgfra staining (Figures 4C and 4D). Transplanted type 1 tu-
mor cells were also found extensively intercalated between
Mbp+ myelin ﬁbers, consistent with its inﬁltrative nature (Figures
4E and 4F). Thus, type 1 and type 2 tumors behave cell
autonomously, conserving their unique histological characteris-
tics and intrinsically distinct growth behavior irrespective of
microenvironment.

Molecular Differences in Adult CNS Progenitor-Driven
Tumors
We next examined the gene expression proﬁles of AscNP pri-
mary gliomas and control tissue from dorsal (cortex and stria-
tum) or ventral (hypothalamus and hindbrain) brain regions of

cal clustering analysis demonstrated clear delineation between
tumor and control samples (Figure 5A). Dimension reduction
analysis using the locally linear embedding (LLE) method pro-
jected the 2,700 differentially expressed genes between tu-
mors and controls (Figure 5A; Table S1) into three-dimensional
space and showed clustering of the type 1 tumors separate
from type 2 tumors, as well as the dorsal and ventral control
groups (Figure 5B). Direct comparison between the clustered
type 1 and type 2 tumors showed clear separation, with differ-
entially expressed genes involved in transcriptional regulation
and neuronal development (Figures 5C and 5D; Tables S2
and S3).

type 1 tumors (Figures 6Ec, 6Ed, and 6G) and were preferentially
found in ventral rather than dorsal brain (Figures 6D and 6H).

We next examined NG2NPP glioma gene expression proﬁles
(Figures S4B and S4C). Similar to AscNP type 2 tumors, clus-
tering analysis of NG2NPP tumors with CNS cell type-speciﬁc
gene proﬁles showed best alignment to OPCs (Figure 6I). Gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA; Subramanian et al., 2005)
comparing AscNP type 1 and type 2 tumors with NG2NPP tu-
mors also showed higher normalized enrichment scores (NES),
and hence, greater alignment of NG2NPP tumors with type 2
gene sets compared to those of type 1 (Tables S4 and S5).
Thus, Ascl1-creERTM model type 2 and NG2-creERTM model tu-
mors show greater relatedness, consistent with both tumors
sharing OPCs as a common cell of origin.

GSEA was next used to examine the relatedness of type 1 and
2 gliomas to molecular signatures of human glioblastoma (Ver-
haak et al., 2010). Differentially expressed genes from compari-
son of Ascl1 type 1 versus type 2 tumors were derived and
analyzed for enrichment of the TCGA human molecular subtype
gene sets (mesenchymal, classical, proneural, and neural) by
GSEA. The data indicate that type 1 tumors show higher enrich-
ment scores than type 2 for the mesenchymal subtype gene sets
(Table 1). These analyses are consistent with the notion that adult
CNS progenitor-driven tumors exhibit similar genetic signatures
as human high-grade gliomas and that these glioma variants
represent molecularly distinct tumors.

Molecular Separation of Murine Gliomas Based on Cell
of Origin
The Ascl1-creERTM transgene drives tumor suppressor recombi-
nation in adult SVZ/SGZ neural progenitors and in adult OPCs,
giving rise to both type 1 and type 2 gliomas, whereas the NG2-
creERTM transgene is conﬁned to adult OPCs and only forms
type 2 gliomas. We turned to a third tamoxifen inducible trans-
gene, Nestin-creERT2, that recombines SVZ/SGZ neural stem
and progenitor cell populations, and shows properties similar
to type 1 tumors (Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009; Chen et al.,
2009). GSEA of Nestin-creERT2 GBM (Nestin-creERT2;Nf1ﬂox/+;

Trp53ﬂox/ﬂox;Ptenﬂox/+; NesNPP) compared to type 2-speciﬁc
NG2NPP (NG2-creERTM;Nf1ﬂox/+;Trp53ﬂox/ﬂox;Ptenﬂox/+) tumors
revealed clear separation when plotted by LLE dimension reduc-
tion analysis (Figure 7A).

We then examined the transcriptional proﬁles of the three
mouse models AscNP, NesNPP, and NG2NPP. We ﬁrst deter-
mined the similarity of the three tumor suppressor mouse models
with those of human GBM, other human tumors of the CNS and
other organ systems with GSEA (Sweet-Cordero et al., 2005). As
shown in Table S6, the AscNP, NesNPP and NG2NPP mouse
models exhibit the highest enrichment scores for human GBM,
and not oligodendroglioma or other CNS or non-CNS tumors,
indicating that the mouse models show the highest molecular
similarity to human GBM.

We next analyzed published data comparing the gene expres-
sion signatures of SVZ-derived stem cells versus OPCs (Becker-
vordersandforth et al., 2010), and found 1,249 differentially
expressed genes from this dataset (Table S7). Unsupervised hi-
erarchical clustering analysis showed that NesNPP and type 1
AscNP gliomas cluster together and separately from type 2 gli-
omas derived from NG2NPP and AscNP models (Figure 7B).
The heatmap showing the top 310 differentially expressed genes
with the highest median absolute deviation (MAD > 0.7; Table S8)
not only demonstrate separation of type 1 from type 2 GBMs but
also show unique expression patterns for all tumor subgroups as
well as lineage-speciﬁc signatures for GBMs initiated from adult
CNS stem cells, adult CNS progenitors, and adult OPCs.

Taken together, these microarray proﬁling data corroborate
the model that at least two separable pools of glioma-initiating
progenitors are susceptible to transformation by loss of identical
human glioma-relevant tumor suppressors Nf1, Trp53, and Pten,
in the adult mouse brain (Figure 7C). In addition to differing
biological characteristics, the resultant GBMs conserve distin-
guishing molecular features reﬂecting their cells of origin. The
development of two different glioblastoma subtypes derived
from two different progenitor populations with the same initiating
mutations show that, in addition to signature mutations and
pathways, the cell of origin for tumor initiation can be an impor-
tant determinant of GBM phenotype. Such ﬁndings in human
GBM would have important implications for tumor molecular
classiﬁcation and treatment measures.

DISCUSSION

Extensive molecular proﬁling of GBM has yielded an ever-reﬁned
genomic landscape (Dunn et al., 2012). These studies have led to
a variety of criteria that stratify GBM into molecular subtypes
(Phillips et al., 2006; Verhaak et al., 2010). However, functional
experimental evidence that validates the existence of biologi-
cally different tumor subclasses lags behind.

The aim of the present study was to examine the tumorigenic
potential of adult CNS committed progenitors and transit-ampli-
fying cells to form GBM. The results demonstrate that, indeed,

(C) Model of adult progenitor cell of origin of gli-

progenitors in the adult mouse brain. GBMs show
overlapping histologic similarity but retain molecu-
lar differences arising from different cellular origins.
See also Tables S6–S8.

adult CNS progenitor cells harboring the same glioma relevant
mutations as applied to stem cells, can give rise to GBM efﬁ-
ciently. An unexpected result identiﬁed two pathologically similar
but molecularly distinct GBM tumor types that arise from different
cells of origin that normally specify separate adult lineages.

Thus, despite limited self-renewal and restricted differen-
tiation potential, tumor suppressor deletion can initiate the
tumorigenic cascade in two types of adult CNS progenitors.
Similar to committed hematopoietic cells, the data indicate
that adult neural and oligodendrocyte progenitors are able to
overcome programmed limitations necessary to engender gli-
oma. In leukemias, oncogenes such as MLL have been shown
to confer properties of enhanced self-renewal (Huntly et al.,
2004), which allow transformed hematopoietic progenitors to
self-renew indeﬁnitely and acquire additional mutations. We
observe early proliferation and differentiation defects in AscNP
mutants, suggesting that tumor suppressor loss likewise leads
to changes in intrinsic programming in transformed CNS progen-
itor cells.

GBM affects adults with a median age of 64 years at time of
diagnosis (Stupp et al., 2005; Wen and Kesari, 2008). In light of
the known phenotypic differences between embryonic and adult
cells (Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009), it is unlikely that
spontaneous GBMs arise in embryonic cells, underscoring the
importance of adult-induced glioma mouse models. Unlike
studies that targeted cultured embryonic cells into mice that
developed tumors almost immediately (Ghazi et al., 2012), we
purposely used a variety of inducible transgenic mice that al-
lowed temporal control of gene ablation in adult brains.

438 Cancer Cell 28, 429–440, October 12, 2015 ª2015 Elsevier Inc.

The Ascl1-creERTM transgene promotes LoxP recombination
and GBM tumorigenesis in both adult neural and oligodendro-
cyte progenitors. However, two separable types of tumors
emerge in AscNP and AscNPP mutants, with type 1 GBMs
resembling the majority of gliomas found in the Nestin-creERT2
(Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009) and hGFAP-Cre lines (Chen
et al., 2012a; Kwon et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2005), and a second
subset of GBMs, designated as type 2. The dual speciﬁcity of
the Ascl1-creERTM transgene to both types of progenitors raised
the possibility that type 2 GBMs arose from adult OPCs. We
conﬁrmed this hypothesis using the NG2NPP models.

The presence of type 1-like tumors in the neural stem cell-spe-
ciﬁc NesNPP models, which molecularly clustered with type 1
AscNP tumors, indicates that the Nestin-creERT2 models fate
into the same cells as Ascl1-creERTM adult neural progenitor
cells. This suggests that the progenitor stage might be a com-
mon endpoint for transformed CNS cells, similar to ﬁndings in
leukemia models (Cozzio et al., 2003). Retrospective analysis
of the hGFAP-Cre-driven glioma models revealed that these
mice also develop type 2 gliomas, which became most apparent
upon growth arrest of type 1 tumors through HSV-thymidine
kinase transgene-targeted killing of cancer stem cells (Chen
et al., 2012a).

OPCs have also been implicated as cells of origin for another
less frequent CNS malignancy, oligodendroglioma. Extensive
analyses show that type 2 GBMs are histologically, genetically,
and molecularly most similar to GBM and are entirely different
from oligodendroglioma, which do not associate with mutations
in NF1 or TP53 (Ohgaki and Kleihues, 2005).

Our study identiﬁes adult OPCs as a source for only one type
of high-grade glioma, the type 2 GBM. Zong and colleagues
have induced gliomas by recombination of the Nf1 and Trp53
tumor suppressors in oligodendrocytic progenitors and found
tumors that appear to be found in the ventral brain (Galvao
et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2011). Taking the present results into
consideration, it is likely that Zong and colleagues are modeling
the type 2 gliomas described here.

Dramatic advances in genomic technology has permitted
molecular stratiﬁcation of glioblastomas on the basis of gene
transcription, copy number, chromosomal
integrity, mutation
spectrum, and related data (Li et al., 2012; Phillips et al., 2006;
Verhaak et al., 2010). These compelling classiﬁcations have pro-
vided momentum to the notion that driver mutations and their
molecular pathways deﬁne GBM subtypes. However, the clinical
implications of these genome-based classiﬁcations remain less
clear.

Our data point to a contrasting scenario in which identical
GBM relevant driver mutations and pathways can promote bio-
logically different tumor types based on the tumor cell of origin.
Type 1 and 2 GBMs arise in different adult progenitor lineages
and develop unique cell autonomous phenotypes, gene expres-
sion proﬁles, and natural history. Our mouse models suggest
that GBM development and prognosis may reﬂect not only the
sum of pathological features and the molecular driver genes,
but equally or more so, the cell of origin in which the mutations
arose. These observations are congruent with those of EWS-
ATF1-induced clear cell sarcoma mouse models reported by
the Capecchi group (Straessler et al., 2013). Thus, use of physi-
ologically relevant glioma mouse models to directly target
different brain cell populations using diverse mutations
frequently found in GBM may serve as complementary tools to-
ward a more reﬁned classiﬁcation of tumor subtypes that takes
the cell of origin and functional analysis into consideration
together with human clinical and genomic data.

Tissue Culture and Transplantations
Primary tumor tissues were freshly dissected from symptomatic mutant mice
and SVZ from age-matched mice were used as controls. Harvested tissues
were minced into single cell suspension and grown as neurospheres. Self-
renewal, differentiation, and ATP assays were performed as previously
described (Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2009).

For transplantation experiments, 4-week-old female nu/nu mice were anes-
thetized and directly injected with 2 3 105 tumor cells into the dorsal striatum
(coordinates: 0 AP, 1.4 ML, 2.3 DV with respect to the bregma). Mice were
aged until symptomatic.

Gene Expression Proﬁle Analysis
Primary tumor tissue and respective control brains were harvested from symp-
tomatic AscNP, NG2NPP, and NesNPP mutants and control mice. Total RNA
extracted from samples was submitted to the UT Southwestern Microarray
Core for analysis using Illumina WG-6 V2 BeadChips. Statistical analysis of mi-
croarray data is described in greater detail in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
