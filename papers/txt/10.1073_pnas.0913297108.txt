Rhabdoid tumors (RTs) are rare, highly aggressive pediatric malig-
nancies with poor prognosis and with no standard or effective
treatment strategies. RTs are characterized by biallelic inactivation
of the INI1 tumor suppressor gene. INI1 directly represses CCND1
and activates cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors p16Ink4a and
p21CIP. RTs are exquisitely dependent on cyclin D1 for genesis and
survival. To facilitate translation of unique therapeutic strategies,
we have used genetically engineered, Ini1+/− mice for therapeutic
testing. We found that PET can be used to noninvasively and accu-
rately detect primary tumors in Ini1+/− mice. In a PET-guided longi-
tudinal study, we found that treating Ini1+/− mice bearing primary
tumors with the pan-cdk inhibitor ﬂavopiridol resulted in complete
and stable regression of some tumors. Other tumors showed resis-
tance to ﬂavopiridol, and one of the resistant tumors overexpressed
cyclin D1, more than ﬂavopiridol-sensitive cells. The concentration
of ﬂavopiridol used was not sufﬁcient to down-modulate the high
level of cyclin D1 and failed to induce cell death in the resistant cells.
Furthermore, FISH and PCR analyses indicated that there is aneu-
ploidy and increased CCND1 copy number in resistant cells. These
studies indicate that resistance to ﬂavopiridol may be correlated to
elevated cyclin D1 levels. Our studies also indicate that Ini1+/− mice
are valuable tools for testing unique therapeutic strategies and for
understanding mechanisms of drug resistance in tumors that arise
owing to loss of Ini1, which is essential for developing effective
treatment strategies against these aggressive tumors.

Rhabdoid tumors (RTs) are highly aggressive pediatric ma-

lignancies characterized by biallelic loss of the INI1 tumor
suppressor. RTs occur in various tissues, including the CNS,
kidneys, and other soft tissues (1). Despite aggressive treatment,
prognosis for children with RTs is poor. Mean survival with
surgical intervention alone is 3 mo and with adjuvant chemo-
therapy and radiotherapy is 8 mo (2). Failure of RT therapies is
possibly because they are based on treatment regimens derived
from other tumor types. These regimens have been used partly
because RTs were previously misclassiﬁed as Wilms tumor,
choroid plexus carcinoma, germ cell tumor, ependymoma, glio-
blastoma, medulloblastoma, and primitive neuroectodermal tu-
mor (1). Because RTs are unique, it is necessary to develop
selective therapies effective against this tumor type. More than
95% of RTs arise owing to biallelic loss or inactivation of INI1
(1, 3). Families that harbor an inherited, mutated/deleted allele
of INI1 suffer from RT predisposition syndrome and often de-
velop rhabdoid and other tumors due to loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) at the INI1 locus (4). Various laboratories, including
ours, have generated genetically engineered mouse models
(GEMMs) that develop tumors due to LOH at the Ini1 locus,
thereby mimicking the etiology of human RTs. Loss of INI1 is
the major and sole critical alteration common to RTs, indicating
that developing molecularly targeted therapies based on INI1
function would help to effectively treat RTs and possibly other

tumors associated with INI1 loss, such as schwannomatosis and
epithelioid sarcoma.

INI1, a component of the SWI/SNF complex, induces G0/G1
arrest in RT cells by direct transcriptional repression of CCND1
and activation of p16INK4a and p21CIP (5, 6). Our studies have
revealed that RTs are exquisitely dependent on cyclin D1 for
genesis and survival, and loss of INI1 leads to derepression of
cyclin D1 in primary mouse and human RTs (7–9). Genetic
abrogation of CCND1 eliminates RT formation in Ini1+/− mice,
and siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCND1 is sufﬁcient to in-
duce G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in RT cells (7). These studies,
together with the fact that INI1 activates CDKIs p16INK4a and
p21CIP, suggested that targeting cyclin D1 or the cyclin/cdk axis
would be an effective means of inhibiting RT growth. Consistent
with this, we have demonstrated that drugs that inhibit cyclin D1
and/or cyclins and cdks, such as fenretinide and ﬂavopiridol, are
effective in inhibiting RT growth with efﬁcacy correlated with
down-modulation of cyclin D1 (10, 11).

Although the above studies demonstrated that targeting cyclin
D1 is effective in inhibiting RTs, they, like the majority of pre-
clinical studies, are based on in vitro and xenograft models.
Xenograft models are often poor predictors of therapeutic out-
come in humans because tumors are most commonly derived
from s.c. implantation of cells and are therefore homogeneous,
ectopic, and developed in immunocompromised mice. In con-
trast to xenografts, GEMM-derived tumors are primary, autoch-
thonous tumors that have appropriate tumor–stromal interactions
and are in the setting of an intact immune system, both factors that
can affect tumor progression and therapeutic response (12). Be-
cause tumors in GEMMs more closely mimic those found in
humans, they are likely better predictors of therapeutic success,
and preclinical testing using GEMMs may allow for more rapid
translation of therapies into human trials (12). Another advantage
is that variable response to drug treatment occurs owing to the
heterogeneity of tumors in GEMMs, allowing for the study of
mechanisms of drug resistance to improve treatment strategies.
Our goal was to use a GEMM for testing unique therapeutic
strategies against RTs. Ini1+/− mice, created in our laboratory,
spontaneously develop CNS, face, and soft-tissue tumors due to
LOH at the Ini1 locus and exhibit many characteristics of human
RTs (7). Despite the advantages of using GEMMs, one limita-
tion is the difﬁculty associated with identifying and monitoring
progression of primary tumors, which often form internally.
Observation and quantiﬁcation of such internal tumors for lon-

gitudinal studies requires a powerful, noninvasive imaging tech-
nique such as PET. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed
tomography have been used to detect human RTs; however, PET
is not yet routinely used for RTs (13).
We found that microPET accurately detects internal primary
tumors spontaneously developed in Ini1+/− mice. We then used
microPET to follow the efﬁcacy of ﬂavopiridol, a pan-cdk inhib-
itor that inhibits RT growth in cell culture and xenograft tumor
models (7, 11). We found that ﬂavopiridol completely elimi-
nates some well-established primary tumors in these mice, but
we also observed ﬂavopiridol-resistant tumors. We character-
ized one resistant tumor and found that ﬂavopiridol resistance
was intrinsic. Furthermore, FISH analysis indicated that the
resistant tumor was aneuploid, and there was an increase in
CCND1 copy number. Our studies demonstrate the feasibility of
using an Ini1+/− GEMM for preclinical testing and PET for
noninvasive imaging of primary tumors arising from loss of Ini1.
The utility of this model to study mechanisms of drug resistance
is also demonstrated.

Results
MicroPET Analysis of Primary Tumors Arising in Ini1+/− Mice. Tumor
visualization by microPET using 2-[(18)F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxyglucose
(18F-FDG) relies on the increased metabolic proﬁle of tumor
cells, involving increased expression of glucose transporters such
as glucose transportor-1 (GLUT-1) (14). This allows detection of
treatment response earlier than anatomic imaging modalities.
GLUT-1 expression has been reported in CNS RTs, indicating
that RTs could possibly be visualized by PET (15). To validate
the use of GEMMs for therapeutic testing, three Ini1+/− mice
with visible tumors were subjected to microPET. The tumors in
these mice were effectively identiﬁed by areas of 18F-FDG up-
take. The visible mass on mouse D84 (Fig. 1A1) demonstrated
a large area of 18F-FDG uptake ventrally below the left jaw (Fig.
1A2 and Movie S1). Additionally, this mouse demonstrated three
internal masses (Fig. 1A2 and Movie S1). Two other mice (E66
and E7) presented with tumors on the face, which were evident
in the digital photographs and PET images (Fig. 2 A1 and A4 and
Movie S2 for mouse E7; and Fig. S1 A1–A5 for mouse E66).
Tumors identiﬁed by microPET were quantiﬁed by drawing
regions of interest (ROIs) and by determining the standard up-
take values (SUVs) as described in Materials and Methods and as
illustrated in Fig. S2.

Fifteen additional mice with symptoms indicative of possible
tumors, such as visible or palpable masses, alopecia, skin irrita-
tion, and behavioral abnormalities (head tilt, unusual gait, and
leg clasping, which are possible indications of CNS tumors) were
subjected to microPET to determine the accuracy and sensitivity
of this detection method. One of these mice (D57) died during
anesthesia before imaging was performed. Imaging of the re-
maining mice revealed the presence of tumors in 3 mice and no
tumors in 11 mice. To ensure the accuracy of microPET, we sub-
jected the 11 mice that did not show tumors to detailed necropsy
and histology. The results of these analyses conﬁrmed the lack of
tumors in these mice and corroborated the microPET ﬁndings.

Effect of Flavopiridol on Growth of Primary Tumors Developed in
Ini1+/− Mice. After establishing that primary tumors can be imaged
and quantiﬁed using PET, we sought to perform a pilot pre-
clinical study using ﬂavopiridol in a panel of six Ini1+/− mice with
tumors as indicated by microPET. These mice were treated with
7.5 mg/kg of ﬂavopiridol once daily, 5 d/wk for 2 wk, followed by
a 2-wk drug-free recovery period before a second course of
treatment. Most mice were subjected to this regimen; however,
a continuous 7-wk treatment schedule was used if the tumors did
not respond to initial
treatment. Mice were imaged using
microPET before and after each course of treatment.

Of the mice undergoing treatment (n = 6), four survived until
the study termination. Two of the surviving mice (D84 and M3)
had complete responses to the ﬂavopiridol regimen, whereas the
other two (E7 and E66) had no response.

Mouse D84 (female, age 15.5 mo) had four tumors in the neck
and abdomen, as indicated by 18F-FDG uptake (Fig. 1A2 and
Movie S1). Remarkably, all tumors regressed completely after
one course of treatment with ﬂavopiridol, as indicated by the loss
of 18F-FDG uptake (Fig. 1B2 and Movie S3). During the 2-wk
treatment interruption one of the abdominal masses reappeared
(Fig. S3A4 and Movie S4). This mass, however, regressed again by
the end of the second treatment course (Fig. S3A5 and Movie S5).
Mouse D84 was observed for 10 wk after the last treatment. No
tumors reappeared during this period, indicating stable tumor-
free survival for this mouse (Fig. S3A6 and Movie S6). At the end
of the study the mouse was necropsied, and no residual tumors
were found, conﬁrming the complete response. The microPET
images were used to quantify the tumors, and plotting SUV vs.
days from the start of the treatment clearly indicated a decrea-
se in all tumor uptake values to background levels (Fig. 1C). The
residual activity seen in Fig. 1B2 and Fig. S3 A4 and A6 was likely
due to uptake in muscle tissue.

Another mouse, M3 (female, age 10 mo), was included in the
study because of a behavioral abnormality: hind limb clasping
when lifted by the tail (Fig. S3B1). MicroPET revealed intense
18F-FDG uptake in the cerebellum (Fig. S3B2). This mouse was
treated with the same schedule as mouse D84, with two rounds of
treatments and 2 wk of treatment interruption between each
round. After the ﬁrst round of ﬂavopiridol treatment, microPET
imaging showed that tracer uptake within the brain had returned
to background levels. Subsequent images after the second round
of treatment indicated that the tumor did not recur (Fig. S3 B3–
B5). The mouse was observed for 4 wk after the last treatment
before necropsy and histopathology. No trace of tumor was found
after the detailed necropsy, which further conﬁrmed complete
regression of the tumor.

In contrast to the above two cases, tumors in mice E7 (female,
age 17 mo) and E66 (female, age 19 mo) showed no response to
ﬂavopiridol. Weekly imaging of both mice demonstrated con-
tinuous tumor growth despite 7 wk of uninterrupted treatment
(mouse E7: compare Fig. 2 A4, A5, and A6; Movies S2, S7, and
S8). Determination of SUVs during the treatment veriﬁed these
ﬁndings (Fig. 2B). The microPET images and histopathology of
the other resistant tumor from mouse E66 before treatment are
shown in Fig. S1 A and B.

Of the remaining two mice included in this study, D56 (male,
age 16 mo) and L68 (male, age 12 mo) died shortly after treat-
ment initiation. It is unclear at this point whether these mice died
of progressive disease or from ﬂavopiridol-associated toxicities.

Histological and Ultrastructural Characterization of a Flavopiridol-
Resistant Tumor. The heterogeneity of GEMM tumors leads to
variable treatment responses, similar to what is observed in
humans, allowing for GEMMs to be better predictors of treat-
ment efﬁcacy. Thus, GEMMs are valuable tools to study drug
resistance. We characterized the resistant tumor from mouse E7
to understand the reasons for resistance. The tumor was used to
establish a primary cell line and orthograft tumors in SCID mice.

Both the primary tumor isolated from E7 and the orthograft of
E7 (xE7) were characterized by histopathology and immuno-
histochemistry (IHC) (Fig. S4). The results indicated that the
tumor was an anaplastic sarcoma containing sheets of loosely
interlacing spindle cells and scattered rhabdoid cells (Fig. S4 A–
C). The presence of spindle cells indicates similarity to other
tumor types, such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
(MPNST) or schwannomatosis. In recent years, loss of INI1 has
been noted in tumors other than RTs, such as schwannomatosis
and epithelioid sarcoma (16, 17). Furthermore, cooccurrence of
schwannomatosis and RT has been noted in a family that carries
a germline INI1 mutation (18). For these reasons, we surmised
that E7’s tumor could be a variant of RTs, and its resistance to
ﬂavopiridol may stem from this fact.

To establish the nature of the tumor, we performed IHC using
a panel of antibodies on parafﬁn sections of normal brain, pri-
mary resistant tumor (E7), and an orthograft-passaged tumor,
xE7 (Fig. S4D). Ini1 staining was negative in the resistant tumor
cells, a primary characteristic of RTs (Fig. S4 D10 and D18).
Cyclin D1 and smooth muscle actin (SMA), often overexpressed
in RTs, were highly expressed within the resistant tumor cells
(Fig. S4 D11, D12, D19, and D20). Other markers, sometimes
overexpressed in RTs, such as glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), synaptophysin, and cytokeratin, were found to be nega-
tive within the resistant tumor (Fig. S4 D13–15 and D21–23).
Because these markers are not consistently expressed in RTs, this
was inconclusive for diagnosis. S100, expressed in MPNST and
schwannomatosis, was also found to be negative within the re-
sistant tumor (Fig. S4 D16 and D24). This IHC panel helped
characterize the resistant tumor and revealed that the orthograft-
passaged tumor maintained characteristics of the primary tumor.
Ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) has demonstrated that RT cells are characterized by the
presence of whorls of cytoplasmic ﬁlaments, an eccentric nucleus,
and one prominent nucleolus (19). To determine whether the
resistant tumor cells retain these characteristics, a comparative
ultrastructural analysis of MON RT cells and ﬂavopiridol-resistant
E7 cells was carried out. TEM of both cell types showed the dis-
tinct characteristics of RTs, indicating that the resistant tumor is
likely rhabdoid (Fig. 3 A and B).

Effect of Drugs on the Survival of Resistant Tumor Cells in Culture.
The mechanism of resistance could be due to a genetic alteration
within the tumor cells (intrinsic mechanism) or due to changes at
the organismal level; either in the tumor environment, tumor
location, or in drug metabolism (extrinsic mechanism). Drug
resistance associated with an extrinsic mechanism will likely be
lost when tumor cells are isolated from the mouse and grown in
culture. Therefore, we isolated cells from the primary tumor and
passaged them in culture to determine their sensitivity to drugs
in vitro. To establish the purity of the culture, we examined the
cells by TEM for the presence of cytoplasmic ﬁlamentous whorls,
a characteristic of RTs (19), and found that >60% of the cells
were clearly rhabdoid.

We observed that E7 cells exhibited limited proliferation, and
after four passages in culture, underwent senescence. Therefore,
we used early passages for in vitro studies. Past studies from our
laboratory demonstrated that ﬂavopiridol (11) and fenretinide
(10) are effective in inhibiting the growth of RT cell lines. We
compared the efﬁcacy of these drugs in E7 cells with that in two
RT cell lines, MON and G401 (IC50 for ﬂavopiridol ≈150 and
200, respectively), which are differentially sensitive to these
drugs. We found that E7 cells are markedly resistant to both
drugs (Fig. 4 A and B). These in vitro studies therefore dem-
onstrated that the mechanism of drug resistance is an intrinsic
mechanism.

The efﬁcacy of both ﬂavopiridol and fenretinide in RT cells
is correlated with their ability to down-regulate cyclin D1 (10,

11). Furthermore, we have found that addition of exogenous
cyclin D1 makes RT cells more resistant to drug treatment (10).
Therefore, we surmised that resistance in E7 cells could be
caused by cyclin D1 overexpression. Consistent with this idea,
immunoblot analysis demonstrated that E7 cells expressed ap-

proximately threefold higher levels of cyclin D1 than MON and
G401 cells (Fig. 4C and Fig. S5A).

From these results, we surmised that the intrinsic resistance
observed in these cells is at least in part due to overexpression of
cyclin D1, and the concentration of ﬂavopiridol achieved in vivo
when 7.5 mg/kg is administered does not repress cyclin D1
enough to inhibit tumor growth. To determine whether ﬂa-
vopiridol is able to down-modulate the elevated level of cyclin
D1 in these cells, we compared the levels of cyclin D1 in un-
treated cells or cells treated with 0.188 μM ﬂavopiridol (which is
above the IC50 concentration in MON cells) using immunoblot
analysis. We found that 0.188 μM ﬂavopiridol reduced cyclin D1
to undetectable levels in MON cells but only partially reduced
levels in E7 cells (Fig. 4D and Fig. S5B). Densitometric analysis
revealed that ﬂavopiridol treatment of E7 cells was only able to
reduce cyclin D1 to the level expressed in untreated MON cells,
indicating that the high level of cyclin D1 within these cells likely
contributes to resistance (Fig. 4D and Fig. S5B).

Mechanism of Cyclin D1 Overexpression. Over-expression of cyclin
D1 protein in E7 cells may be explained by aberrant or increased
transcription, protein stability, or extra genomic copies of
CCND1. We used FISH to determine whether there is increased
copy number of the CCND1 genomic locus in E7 cells. FISH on
a parafﬁn section of E7 tumor showed that >60% of cells have
three or more copies of the CCND1 locus (Fig. S6 A and B).
FISH analysis of the interphase nuclei of the E7 tumor cells in
culture using two different BAC clones (one CCND1-speciﬁc
probe and another to the 3′ region of the CCND1 locus); also
showed that 80% of these cells had three or more copies of
CCND1 per cell (Fig. S6C; refer to Fig. S7A for hybridization of
control cells using these probes). These studies indicated that

there is ampliﬁcation of the CCND1 locus (more than two copies
per cell) in the majority of tumor cells.

To determine whether ampliﬁcation of CCND1 exceeds that of
the another gene on the same chromosome, we ﬁrst carried out
quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis using DNA from normal liver
and E7 tumor, comparing the dosage of CCND1 with that of
protein kinase c-γ (PRKCC), a gene proximal to the centromere
on chromosome 7 or to that of ribosomal protein S18 gene
(RPS18), a housekeeping gene (Fig. 4E). The dosage of CCND1
was increased approximately threefold in tumor cells when nor-
malized to either that of PRKCC or RPS18 (Fig. 4E). Karyotype
analysis of E7 resistant tumor cell metaphase spreads indicated
that cells were variably aneuploid (Fig. 4E and Fig. S7 A and B)
and had copy numbers of CCND1 exceeding the expected ploidy
in most cells (Fig. 4F, ﬁfth column). Further analysis indicated
that CCND1 mapped not only to the extranumerary copies of
mouse chromosome 7 (gain reﬂecting whole chromosome aneu-
ploidies) but was also ampliﬁed owing to genomic rearrangements
with chromosome 19 (Fig. S7 B and C). These results indicated
that the increase in cyclin D1 levels in the E7 tumor is likely due to
increased copy number of CCND1 locus.

To facilitate the translation of unique therapeutic strategies, we
have used an Ini1+/− GEMM for preclinical studies. We dem-
onstrated that microPET detects primary tumors arising in these
mice with a high degree of speciﬁcity. Furthermore, microPET
allows for quantiﬁcation of tumor response, such that longitu-
dinal therapeutic efﬁcacy studies can be conducted. To fully
validate this model for preclinical testing, we carried out a pilot
study using ﬂavopiridol. Overall, we found that response to ﬂa-
vopiridol was variable and represented an all-or-none phenom-
enon. Of the six mice selected for treatment, four survived to
receive full courses of treatment, and two died during treatment.
Of the four surviving mice, two showed complete tumor re-
gression, and two demonstrated resistance to therapy with no
response. It is interesting to note that there were no partial
responses to ﬂavopiridol. This may reﬂect the property of ﬂa-
vopiridol, whereby achieving a threshold concentration is critical
for its function and below this concentration it is ineffective.
These ﬁndings demonstrate the importance of using GEMMs for
preclinical studies; despite the common origin of these tumors,
other genetic variations within tumors and between animals re-
sult in different responses to chemotherapeutics.

The response seen in mouse D84 is dramatic: four well-
established tumors regressed completely after one round of ﬂa-
vopiridol treatment. A second mouse, mouse M3, presented with
a behavioral abnormality, and microPET showed intense uptake
near the cerebellum. This uptake was stably reduced to back-
ground levels after one round of ﬂavopiridol treatment. Because
RTs are aggressive and have very poor prognosis any success in
completely eliminating these tumors in preclinical models is
signiﬁcant, and these results may lead to improved therapeutic
strategies.
Ini1+/− GEMMs more closely mimic RT predisposition syn-
drome, and a recent study found the occurrence of RTs and
schwannomatosis in one family due to the same inherited mu-
tation in INI1 (18). It may therefore be important to consider the
age of onset and characteristics of the tumors because germline
INI1 mutations are capable of inducing several distinct malig-
nancies that will likely respond differently to therapies.
Ini1+/− mice also are valuable for the study of resistance to
unique therapeutic strategies. In this study we have isolated
a mouse RT resistant to ﬂavopiridol. Cells from this tumor
expressed threefold higher levels of cyclin D1 than ﬂavopiridol-
sensitive RT cells. Increased protein levels were correlated to
increased CCND1 copy number in tumor cells that was a result of
aneuploidy and genomic rearrangement. CCND1 was found both

on extranumerary chromosome 7 and on chromosome 19. Ad-
ditionally, concentrations of ﬂavopiridol sufﬁcient to completely
down-modulate cyclin D1 in other RT cells were not sufﬁcient to
do so in resistant E7 cells. These results suggest a role for in-
creased CCND1 copy number in inducing resistance to ﬂavopir-
idol. Further studies are required to establish the nature of
genomic rearrangements and a deﬁnitive role of cyclin D1 in
promoting drug resistance in RTs. Nevertheless, our results are in
line with the previous observation that cyclin D1 is essential for
survival and genesis of RTs and that the efﬁcacy of ﬂavopiridol
correlated with down-modulation of cyclin D1 (7, 10, 11).

Interestingly, higher concentrations of ﬂavopiridol and fenre-
tinide induced cytotoxicity in E7 resistant cells in vitro (Fig. 4 A
and B), indicating that perhaps administering higher amounts of
ﬂavopiridol may be effective in inhibiting these resistant tumors.
Unfortunately, ﬂavopiridol at concentrations higher than 7.5 mg/
kg is toxic to mice and hence we could not test this hypothesis in
vivo. We believe that developing more tolerable derivatives of
ﬂavopiridol or combining ﬂavopiridol with other drugs that can
act synergistically to lower its IC50 will be valuable for treating
these resistant tumors.

Flavopiridol may be effective in eliminating not only RTs but
other tumors that have lost INI1 and express moderate levels of
cyclin D1. RTs and other tumors that express higher levels of
cyclin D1 could be treated with ﬂavopiridol in combination with
other drugs. Further analysis of such drug combinations that
improve the efﬁcacy of ﬂavopiridol may provide a much-needed
therapeutic strategy for RTs, which are notoriously resistant to
current treatment regimens.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Breeding, maintenance, and treatment of mice were carried out in
accordance with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC), accredited by Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International and approved by
the National Institutes of Health Ofﬁce of Laboratory Animal Welfare, and
inspected by the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service. At study termination, all mice were humanely
killed according to IACUC protocols. C57BL/6J mice carrying Ini1+/Δexons6,7
mutations (denoted as Ini1+/−) were generated in our laboratory as pre-
viously described (7). SCID mice used for orthografting were purchased from
Taconic and maintained as previously described (11).

PET Imaging and Quantitation of Tumors. Mice were fasted for 3 to 4 h, then
anesthetized with isofurane gas and injected with 200–300 μCi of 18F-FDG via
tail vein. After injection, 60 min was allowed for adequate uptake of 18F-FDG
throughout the body. For PET scanning, the mouse was placed at the center
of the scanner’s ﬁeld of view (R4 scanner; Concord) and subjected to a 10-
min transmission scan (using a 57Co source) followed by a 10-min emission
scan. Any mouse suspected to have a brain tumor (either by symptoms or
from review of the whole body image) underwent additional scans centered
on the brain. Mice were recovered from anesthesia for 10–15 min after the
scan.
Images were reconstructed using the ordered subsets expectation
maximization protocol with attenuation and scatter corrections and by ap-
plying a zoom factor of either 2 or 5 for body images or brain images,
respectively.

Tumor masses were quantiﬁed by calculating SUVs using ASIPro software
(CTI Molecular Imaging). Using ASIPro, 3D ROIs were selected to encompass
the region of increased 18F-FDG uptake (representing the tumor mass). To
minimize partial-volume effects arising because the activity-containing vol-
ume (e.g., tumor) is below the intrinsic resolution of the scanner, ROIs were
consistently drawn to enclose a 30- to 40-μL volume. SUVs of the ROIs were
calculated by the software using a ratio of the radioactivity concentration
within the ROIs at a given time to the injected dose of radiation and divided
by the body weight of the mouse. A ROI was also selected for the liver to
determine background 18F-FDG uptake.

In Vivo Drug Treatment. Solutions of 1 mg/mL ﬂavopiridol were prepared
weekly in 0.9% saline (AmTech) containing 0.1% DMSO, heated to 37 °C,
vortexed, and stored at −80 °C. The solution was again heated to 37 °C and

vortexed to dissolve the drug completely before i.p. injection at a ﬁnal dose
of 7.5 mg/kg according to the weight of each mouse.

Isolation of a Primary Cell Line from Flavopiridol-Resistant Mouse E7 Tumor.
Immediately after killing, the tumor was resected, dipped in 70% ethanol,
and placed in αMEM supplemented with 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 μg/mL
streptomycin (P/S). The tumor was diced using sterile scalpels and centri-
fuged at 67 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and pellet was
resuspended in 10 mL of αMEM medium supplemented with P/S and 10%
FBS. The suspension was then plated into several wells of a six-well plate and
incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2. Medium was changed twice per week, and
when adherent cells reached 60% conﬂuency they were passaged. Cells
grown in αMEM were easily adapted to DMEM supplemented with P/S, 2 mM
L-glutamine, and 10% FBS for further studies.

Establishment of Orthografted Tumors. The primary tumor mass resected from
the mouse was disaggregated by dicing in αMEM medium and by passing
through a 19G needle. Tumor suspension (300 μL) was injected s.c. into the
ﬂank of SCID mice. Before reaching 300 mm3, tumors were passaged into
new SCID mice. Cells were isolated from orthografted tumors in the same
manner as from the primary tumor for in vitro studies.

Cell Culture and Drug Treatments. The INI1-null RT cell lines, MON (3) and
G401 (American Type Culture Collection), were cultured as previously de-
scribed (11). Cells isolated from the ﬂavopiridol-resistant tumor (E7) and an
orthograft-passaged tumor (xE7) were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, P/S, and 2 mM L-glutamine. Flavopiridol and fenretinide stock
solutions were prepared as previously described (10, 11). Working solutions
(3 μM ﬂavopiridol, 50 μM fenretinide) and serial dilutions were prepared by
diluting the stocks with culture medium, such that the ﬁnal concentrations
of DMSO and ethanol were constant in all wells of each assay.

Drug Effects on Cell Survival in Vitro. Methyl-tetrazolium salt assays were
carried out as previously described (11).

Transmission Electron Microscopy. Cells were ﬁxed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer at room temperature. Cells were postﬁxed
with 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated
through a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in LX112 resin (LADD
Research Industries). Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut UCT
and stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. Images were col-
lected using a JEOL 100 CXII or JEOL 1200EX electron microscope at 80 kv.

Immunoblot Analysis. Chemiluminescence detection was achieved using
SuperSignal West Pico or Femto Chemiluminescence Substrate (#34080 or
#34095; Pierce) and by using α-INI1 (20), α-cyclin D1 (#MS-210; Thermo Sci-
entiﬁc), and α-GAPDH (#MAB374; Chemicon International) antibodies.

FISH and Genomic Analysis. BAC clones speciﬁc to CCND1 locus (RP24-186B2,
chr7:152,062,597-152,230,717) and to the 3′ end ﬂanking region (RP24-
316N16, chr7:152,331,071-152,515,971) were obtained from Bac/Pac Re-
sources Children’s Hospital and Research Center at Oakland, CA (http://bacpac.
chori.org/vectorsdet.htm). DNA isolation and labeling and hybridization and
detection were performed as previously described (21). Labeled probes
(CCND1 locus-speciﬁc probe in Spectrum Orange and 3′ end ﬂanking region in
biotin detected Alexa 647) were tested to ensure unique mapping to the locus
of interest on mouse WT C57B6 female metaphase spleen preps (Fig. S7A1).
Tumor cells were grown to 40–60% conﬂuency in four-well chamber slides
(#354104; BD Falcon), ﬁxed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min, and pretreated for
removal of cytoplasm [pepsin (Sigma), 50 μg/mL for 10 min,] before FISH
analysis. For performing FISH on parafﬁn sections, 4-μM-thin tumor sections
were incubated overnight on a slide warmer at 60 °C, deparafﬁnized in xylene,
and pretreated with a protease solution (Vysis, Abbott Molecular) at 37 °C for
20 min, as previously described (21). Chromosome counts for ploidy and full
karyotype were carried out by the expert author C.M., on the basis of inverted
DAPI images using the BandView application of the ASI acquisition system
(Applied Spectral Imaging). Quantitative PCR analysis was carried out using
primers for mouse CCND1 (5′: AGTCGGGGAGGGGTGCCTTC; 3′: TGCAG-
GAATGGGGCACAAGC) and mouse PRKCC (5′: TGCCGGGGTGTTGCTTTCTG;
3′: GGTGGACGGCGGTAGGAGGA).

Histopathology and Immunohistochemical Analysis. Parafﬁn sections (5 μm)
were deparafﬁnized in xylene followed by graded alcohols and stained us-
ing H&E or subjected to IHC. For IHC, antigen retrieval was performed in
10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 96 °C for 30 min. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked using 0.3% hydrogen peroxide. The sub-
sequent steps were based on a standard protocol (11). Primary antibodies used
were α-INI1 at 1:100 (BD Transduction Laboratories, #612110), α-cyclin D1 (#18–
0220; at 1:100; Zymed;), α-SMA (#A2547; at 1:1,000; Sigma), α-GFAP (#Z00334;
at 1:1,000; Dako), synaptophysin (#1485-1; at 1:250; Epitomics), α-pan-cyto-
keratin (#C2562; at 1:300; Sigma), and α-S100 (#MS-296; at 1:500; Thermo
Scientiﬁc) antibodies.
