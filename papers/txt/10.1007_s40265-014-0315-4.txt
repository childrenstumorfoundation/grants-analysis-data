Abstract The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases
(MAPKK) MEK1 and MEK2 are integral members of
the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and are of interest in
the development of anti-cancer therapeutics. The MAPK/
ERK pathway is dysregulated in more than 30 % of
cancers, predominately by mutations in RAS and BRAF
proteins, and MEK serves as a potential downstream
target for both of these. The biology of MEK inhibition
is complex, as the molecule is differentially regulated by
upstream RAS or RAF. This has impacted on the past
development of MEK inhibitors as treatments for cancer
and may be exploited in more rational, molecularly
selected drug development plans in the future. The role
of MEK in cancer and the mechanism of action of MEK
inhibitors is reviewed. Furthermore, MEK inhibitors that
are available in standard practice, as well as those most

next steps in the development of MEK inhibitors are
considered.

Key Points

MEK1 and MEK2 are integral elements of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK
pathway and are important molecules for targeted
therapy drug development in cancer.

The activity of MEK inhibitors is differentially
regulated by upstream activation of RAS as opposed
to BRAF, and the activity of MEK inhibitors will be
structure dependent.

Trametinib was the ﬁrst MEK1/2 inhibitor approved
for cancer therapy; however, several other MEK
inhibitors have demonstrated interesting activity as
single agents as well as in combination with other
cancer therapies.

1 Introduction

With the development of clinical sequencing platforms for
cancer genotyping, the role for oncogene-targeted therapies
has grown rapidly. Mutations in multiple growth pathways
have been identiﬁed and there is a growing list of small
molecules that have been successfully developed as tar-
geted therapies for cancer. Here we focus on the role of

the inhibition of MEK.

2 Role of MEK in Cancer

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
plays a critical role in multiple cellular functions and is
constitutively activated in a wide range of human cancers.
Canonical MAPK signaling results from activation of
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) on the cell surface such
as the epidermal growth factor receptor, HER kinases,
MET and the ﬁbroblast-growth factor receptor [1]. Upon
activation of an RTK by a mitogen (growth factors, cyto-
kines, etc.), RTKs generally undergo dimerization and
transphosphorylation, leading to their activation. Thereaf-
ter, small adaptor proteins, such as SHC, son of sevenless
(SOS), and GRB, associate with activated RTKs recruiting
guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF). At the cell
membrane, these GEFs activate RAS GTP-ases (H-, K-,
N-RAS) by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP by
RAS [2, 3]. When GTP is bound, RAS-GTP triggers acti-
vation signals down multiple growth pathways including
MAPK as well as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
and RalGEF-Ral [4, 5]. RAS activity is regulated under
physiologic conditions due to an inherent low-level GTP-
ase activity of the RAS protein that facilitates a normal
exchange of GTP to GDP, eventually extinguishing sig-
naling by RAS GTP.

After RAS activation, RAF kinases (A- B-, C-RAF
[RAF-1]) are recruited to the cell membrane in associa-
tion with RAS [6, 7], are differentially phosphorylated
[8], and undergo dissociation from RAF kinase inhibitory
protein [9]. RAFs are activated via phosphorylation of
homo- or heterodimer RAF complexes [6], and then act as
serine/threonine MAPK kinase kinases
(MAPKKK),
directly activating MAPKK (MEK1/MEK2) [10]. Among
RAF isoforms, B-RAF has been associated with a much
higher potency for MEK phosphorylation relative to other
isoforms. Other MAPKKK proteins also exist and can
modulate MEK activity via phosphorylation. Notable
include MAP3K8 (COT/Tpl2) and
examples of
PAK1, which have both been implicated in cancer pro-
cesses [11].

this

After MEK activation, MEK acts as an MAPKK via
dual-speciﬁcity tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activ-
ity on MAPK (ERK1/ERK2) [12]. ERKs are the only
known phosphorylation targets of MEKs. The conse-
quences of ERK activation by different MEK isoforms (e.g.
MEK1 vs. MEK2) are under
investigation; however,
potential differences are not yet clearly relevant in the
development of MEK inhibitors for cancer therapy. Phos-
phorylated MAPK/ERK proteins
serine/

function as

threonine kinases, activating many cytoplasmic and nuclear
mediators such as kinases, phosphatases, and transcription
factors. The activity of signal transduction via RAF-MEK-
ERK, and eventual downstream ERK output, is dependent
on scaffold proteins notably including the IQGAP family.
Of the three IQGAP members, IQGAP1 is understood the
best; more than 90 partner molecules have been found that
associate with IQGAP1, including many oncogenic pro-
teins [13]. In the context of scaffold support, activated
ERK then facilitates multiple cellular processes such as cell
proliferation, motility,
survival.
Examples of downstream ERK targets include cell cycle
proteins such as cyclin D, transcription factors such as
MYC and FOS, as well as the regulatory protein families
SPRY and DUSP, which mediate negative feedback on the
MAPK pathway [14, 15].

differentiation,

and

factor

While canonical signaling through the MAPK pathway
appears uni-linear at ﬁrst glance, feedback regulation of the
pathway and cross-talk between MAPK proteins and other
pathways, such as PI3K, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
(NF)-jB, p38, and others, complicate
nuclear
attempts to develop inhibitors of this pathway as anti-
cancer agents [16, 17]. Feedback regulation of the MAPK
pathway has recently gained interest due to the develop-
ment of inhibitors of oncogenic MAPK component proteins
such as V600E BRAF. After suppression of oncogenic
BRAF, a rebound of ERK activity eventually results in
resistance to upstream BRAF inhibition. This has been
attributed to relief of BRAF inhibitor-induced physiologic
ERK-dependent feedback via SPRY and DUSP activity,
reactivation of RTK by ligand binding, increased Ras-GTP,
and generation of physiologic RAF dimers that are insen-
sitive to selective V600E BRAF inhibitors [18]. Similar
feedback, as well as cross-talk with other pathways, may
inﬂuence the ability of MEK inhibitors to effectively
inhibit their targets as well (Fig. 1).

The importance of the MAPK pathway is emphasized by
the recurrent mutations found in RTKs that activate this
pathway as well as the speciﬁc signaling components that
make it up. The MAPK pathway is activated in at least
30 % of human cancers through activating mutations in
RAS or BRAF [19]. Of these, aberrant RAS activity plays a
major role, with RAS mutations being commonly associ-
ated with carcinomas of the pancreas (63–90 %), colon
(36–50 %),
lung (19–30 %), and melanoma (15–20 %)
[20, 21]. Mutations in RAS are frequently found in codons
12, 13, and 61, with variability by RAS isoform and cancer
histology [22]. KRAS mutations occur at codon 12 at a
frequency of approximately 80 %, while many fewer
mutations occur in codon 61. This contrasts with NRAS,
where codon 61 is mutated in 60 % of cases, while less
than 35 % are mutated at codon 12. Mutation frequency in
HRAS is less polarized, with a nearly 50 % split between

codons 12 and 61, though the incidence of HRAS mutation
in human cancers is much less frequent than K- and NRAS
[21]. The association of some of these mutations with
speciﬁc cancer types has been determined to be due to
particular genetic insults. For example, ionizing radiation
skews toward RAS Q61 mutations via the formation of
pyrimidine dimers, as seen in cutaneous melanoma [23],
whereas chemical carcinogenesis, by tobacco smoking,

leads to the development of the DNA adducts and bias
toward RAS G12 mutations, as commonly seen in non-
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [24].

BRAF is the most frequently mutated protein kinase in
human malignancies [25]. Mutations of BRAF have been
characterized as approximately 50 % of driver mutations in
cutaneous melanoma [25, 26], and several other tumor
types such as 10–15 % of colorectal carcinomas [25], 3 %

2114

J. J. Luke et al.

of NSCLC [27], 3 % of breast cancers [28], 20–50 % of
serous ovarian cancers [29–31], and 29–69 % of papillary
thyroid cancers [32, 33]. The presence of mutations in
BRAF has also been correlated with an unfavorable prog-
nosis [34, 35]. Why BRAF, as opposed to ARAF or CRAF,
is recurrently mutated is not clear. However, structural
analysis of BRAF suggests that a single mutation in V600
can introduce a stable mutated catalytic site of the BRAF
protein, whereas multiple mutations would be predicted to
be required for a stable mutated form of ARAF or CRAF
[36, 37].

Oncogenic mutations in MEK are much less frequent
than RAS or BRAF mutations; ERK mutations have not
been described. In NSCLC, mutations in MEK1 (Q56P,
K57N, D67N) have been described as constituting less than
1 % of mutations [38]. In melanoma, mutations in MEK1
and MEK2 have been described in up to 8 % of patient
samples [39], and appear to co-exist with mutations in RAS
and BRAF in some cases [40]. In the setting of anti-cancer
treatment directed toward BRAF, MEK mutations as sec-
ondary resistance mechanisms have also been observed.
After treatment with a selective BRAF inhibitor in V600E
BRAF cell lines and patient samples, mutations in MEK1
C121S, F129L, and P124L as well as MEK2 C125S have
conferred resistance to inhibitors of both BRAF and MEK
[41–44]. Similarly, after a combination strategy of BRAF
and MEK inhibitors, a MEK2 Q60P mutation has been
observed in a post-treatment patient sample [45].

3 Mechanism of Action of MEK Inhibitors

MEK, the MAPK kinase, is a dual-speciﬁc tyrosine and
serine/threonine kinase, with ERK being the only known
phosphorylation target. Regulation of MEK is via phos-
phorylation by RAF on serine residues in the catalytic
domain at codons 217 and 221 [46]. Stoichiometric analysis
of phosphorylation on MEK by RAF conﬁrms that RAF
facilitates phosphorylation at both sites with rapid kinetics,
ruling out intrinsic autophosphorylation of MEK protein. All
RAFs are able to phosphorylate MEKs; however, the degree
of MEK activation that results is variable: BRAF is the most
potent, followed by CRAF and ARAF [10].

RAF-mediated activation of MEK is differentially reg-
ulated in KRAS and BRAF mutant molecular environ-
ments, as illustrated by the differential anti-proliferative
effects of various MEK inhibitors and especially in the
variable activity of the small-molecule MEK inhibitors that
have been brought into clinic to date [47–50]. This dif-
ference may be partly understood by dissecting the feed-
back induced via inhibition of the MAPK pathway at
different levels (Fig. 1). In the setting of MEK inhibition of
KRAS mutant cells, release of feedback on upstream RTK

by SPRY and DUSP leads to physiologic signaling through
MAPK (due to abundant wild-type RAF), resulting in an
increase of phosphorylated MEK [50, 51]. This is in con-
trast to V600 BRAF mutant cells where the low level of
wild-type RAF does not lead to increased MEK phos-
phorylation, thus allowing persistent suppression of MEK
[49, 51]. In KRAS mutant cells, BRAF-CRAF heterodi-
mers have been described as the predominant RAF com-
plexes as depletion of B- or ARAF, but not CRAF, has
been linked to MEK phosphorylation after MEK inhibitor
treatment, leading to downstream ERK phosphorylation
and reactivation of the MAPK pathway with an impact on
the anti-neoplastic effect [46, 52].

In this context, the mechanism of MEK inhibition by
different small molecules has the potential to determine
impact the anti-neoplastic effect (Fig. 2). Two mechanisms
for MEK inhibition then become obvious, one being inhi-
bition of RAF phosphorylation activity of MEK or an
allosteric association of an inhibitor with MEK impeding
the conformational shift induced by phosphorylation on
serine 217 and 221. Some data to support such models exist
in which MEK inhibitors have been described to directly
inhibit RAF phosphorylation of MEK, [49, 53] though the
exact mechanism has been unclear.

In a series of elegant modeling and functional experi-
ments, Hatzivassiliou et al. [46] have described a mecha-
nism for differential potency of different MEK inhibitors.
Using crystal structures and serine mutagenesis of MEK,
they demonstrated that formation of a strong hydrogen
bond by higher potency MEK inhibitors to serine 212 of
MEK disrupts the hydrogen-bond network between the
serine 212 side chain, the activation loop helix, and the
glutamate 114 of the a-C helix of the MEK protein. This
prevents access of RAF to serine 217 of MEK, decreases
phosphorylation, and stabilizes the RAF-MEK complex.
RAF-MEK complexes are speciﬁc to wild-type RAF as
V600 BRAF signals downstream as a monomer [54]. As
such, this RAF-MEK stabilization has a more powerful
anti-neoplastic effect in KRAS mutant models. This is
consistent with previous reports, which have also described
an interaction of MEK inhibitors with serine 212 [55, 56].
In V600E BRAF models, a correlation was observed
between high MEK inhibitor-binding afﬁnity and MEK
inhibition due to the high basal MEK activity in V600
BRAF cancers [46]. This high binding afﬁnity was
described as secondary to interactions between a high-
afﬁnity binding MEK inhibitor and the a-C helix and cat-
alytic loop of MEK. These data are also consistent with
previous experiments demonstrating the differential acti-
vation of MEK by V600 BRAF versus wild-type RAF in
(B- and CRAF) in KRAS mutant models [57, 58]. These
experiments suggest that the chemical structure of different
MEK inhibitors could be rationally tailored in their clinical

MEK Inhibitors for Cancer

Fig. 2 In KRAS mutant tumors, the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 leads
to formation of CRAF–MEK complexes, resulting in MEK phos-
phorylation and reactivation of the MAPK pathway. Trametinib
induces formation of CRAF–MEK complexes, but inhibits MEK
phosphorylation by CRAF (by inducing a conformational change in

MEK). CH5126766 does not induce relevant CRAF/MEK interaction
(by increasing dissociation of MEK from CRAF), thereby preventing
phosphorylation of MEK. As a result, both trametinib and
CH5126766 lead to more sustained ERK phosphorylation relative
to older-generation MEK inhibitors such as PD0325901

beneﬁt as anti-neoplastic activity could be predicted prior
to dosing of human subjects based on BRAF or KRAS
mutation.

The activity of MEK inhibitors in the setting of mutant
RAS has been further elucidated by Lito et al. [59] in the
speciﬁc setting of KRAS mutant tumors. By administering
the MEK inhibitors PD0325901, selumetinib, and refa-
metinib in conjunction with a library of doxycycline-
inducible short hairpin RNAs against components of RAS
effector pathways, they identiﬁed CRAF as the primary
mediator of MEK activation in KRAS mutant
tumors.
Further, after blockade of ERK signaling, as by MEK
inhibitor treatment, CRAF was observed to robustly reac-
tivate and mediate rebound in ERK phosphorylation in
KRAS as compared with V600E BRAF mutant cells. Using
an engineered FLAG-MEK1, they found that treatment
with allosteric MEK inhibitors in the setting of RAS
mutant cell lines leads to formation of RAF-MEK com-
plexes (predominately CRAF-MEK), whereas this is not
the case in BRAF mutant cells. This RAF-MEK complex is
then less sensitive to MEK inhibition in terms of reduction
of phosphorylated ERK as compared with the free MEK
observed in the BRAF mutation setting. Thus, MEK
inhibitors activate CRAF by relieving ERK-dependent
negative feedback and cause the formation of CRAF-MEK
complexes, leading to attenuation of MEK inhibition in
KRAS mutant tumors.

Thereafter, Lito et al. [59] show that the efﬁcacy of
MEK inhibition in the RAS mutation setting can be mod-
ulated by two approaches that are exempliﬁed by newer
MEK inhibitors: trametinib and CH5126766, a novel MEK
inhibitor. Using surface plasmon resonance to deﬁne the
dissociation constant of MEK1 with B- or CRAF, they
show that trametinib reduces the formation of RAF-MEK
complexes. This is despite a proposed similar mechanism
of action of
trametinib to the older MEK inhibitor
PD0325901 in inhibiting the catalytic activity of MEK.

complexes, yet also inhibits ERK rebound. Using a struc-
ture guided approach, Lito et al. [59] demonstrated that
CH5126766 interacts with serine 222 and asparagine 221
on MEK. This prevents MEK phosphorylation by CRAF,
leading to MEK inhibitor-bound, dephosphorylated MEK
binding to RAF and a subsequent increase of RAF-MEK
complexes. Notably, this model of CH5126766 activity is,
to some extent, at odds with the model proposed by Hat-
zivassiliou et al. [46]. The different ﬁndings are potentially
explained by the fact that Lito et al. [59] completely solved
the ternary structure of CH5126766-bound MEK1, as
opposed to a limited structure used previously, showing
that CH5126766 forms interactions at multiple positions
beyond serine 212 of MEK and displaces the activation
segment of MEK1. Nevertheless, both of these models will
likely be useful in the future development of more potent
MEK inhibitors.

4 Approved and Investigational MEK Inhibitors

of Signiﬁcance in Clinical Development

The ﬁrst generation of MEK1/2 inhibitors, such as CI-
1040, demonstrated poor exposure in human subjects,
limiting their utility [60]. Second-generation inhibitors,
such as PD325901, overcame this problem, but had a poor
safety proﬁle, with dose-limiting toxicities such as neuro-
logical and eye toxicities [61]. Subsequent generations of
MEK inhibitors are now being investigated and appear to
be more potent and more tolerable. The agents that are
furthest along in clinical development are compared in
Table 1 and reviewed here.

by RAF on serine 217 of MEK1 and suppresses phos-
phorylated ERK. The MEK kinase-speciﬁc suppressive
activity of trametinib has been broadly validated across a
panel of kinases [62]. Trametinib has also shown differ-
ential activity against BRAF and NRAS mutants, as com-
pared with wild-type, cell lines and xenografts [62, 63].

4.1.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism

Dose escalation of trametinib resulted in a maximum tol-
erated dose of 3 mg continuous daily dosing and a rec-
ommended phase II dose (RP2D) of 2 mg daily [63].
Fasting pharmacodynamic monitoring demonstrated dose
proportionality up to 6 mg daily, with an effective half-life
of approximately 4.5 days. Steady state drug levels were
reached by day 15 of dosing. At 2 mg daily, on day 15, the
mean area under the curve (AUC) over 24 h was 376 ngh/
mL and maximum concentration (Cmax) was 23 ng/mL.
The trough concentrations ranged from a mean of 10.0 to
18.9 ng/mL. Trametinib exhibits non-cytochrome P450
(CYP)-mediated metabolism, primarily via deacetylation
and glucuronidation.

4.1.3 Clinical Experience

In a phase I study of 206 patients with advanced solid
tumors, a response rate (RR) for trametinib was determined
as 10 % [63]. Within a melanoma-only cohort of the study,
97 patients were treated. These included V600E/K BRAF
(total of 36 patients, 30 BRAF inhibitor naive), wild-type
BRAF (39 patients), BRAF status unknown (six patients),
and uveal (16 patients) [64]. An RR of 33 % was deter-
mined for BRAF inhibitor-naive patients with median
progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.7 months. In BRAF
wild-type patients, the RR was 10 %; no responses were
observed in patients with uveal melanoma.

The phase III METRIC study subsequently evaluated
trametinib as compared with dacarbazine (DTIC) or

paclitaxel in patients with melanoma harboring a V600E/K
BRAF mutation [65]. A total of 322 patients were ran-
domized in a two-to-one ratio favoring trametinib. Cross-
over to trametinib was allowed at progression of disease. A
median PFS of 4.8 months was determined in the intention-
to-treat population of the trametinib-treated arm versus
1.5 months (p \ 0.001) for the DTIC- or paclitaxel-treated
arm. An early suggestion of improvement in survival with
trametinib as compared with chemotherapy was also noted,
with an immature hazard ratio (HR) for death of 0.54 (95 %
[CI] 0.32–0.92, p = 0.01) despite
conﬁdence interval
cross-over of nearly half of the study population.

Combination therapy with inhibitors of BRAF and MEK
via dabrafenib and trametinib has also been explored. In a
phase I/II study, doses of 150 mg twice daily of dabrafenib
and 2 mg daily of trametinib were found to be the RP2D.
Only patients with V600E/K BRAF-mutant melanoma
were enrolled, and the phase II portion of the study eval-
uated doses of 150 and 2 mg (dabrafenib/trametinib) as
well as 150 and 1 mg compared with dabrafenib 150 mg
twice daily. An improvement in both RR (76 vs. 54 %,
p = 0.03.) and PFS (9.4 vs. 5.8 months, p \ 0.001) was
observed when dabrafenib and trametinib (150/2) were
compared with dabrafenib monotherapy [66]. Additionally,
fewer adverse events for the combination were observed
when compared with dabrafenib alone,
including the
development of squamous cell carcinoma (7 vs. 19 %). Of
note, pyrexia (71 vs. 26 %) was increased with the com-
bination. Based on this,
the drug combination was
approved by the US FDA in 2014.

Data from the phase III clinical trial of dabrafenib and
trametinib combination therapy versus dabrafenib and
placebo are eagerly awaited. In January 2014, a commu-
nication from the drug manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline
revealed that the primary endpoint of PFS had been met.
The median PFS was described as 9.3 months in the dab-
rafenib and trametinib arm as compared with 8.8 months in
the dabrafenib arm (HR 0.75, p = 0.035). The combina-
tion therapy was described to have an RR of 67 versus
51 % for dabrafenib. Toxicity was similar to the previously
described phase II results. Data on overall survival (OS)
were not yet mature [67].

4.1.4 Safety Proﬁle

(diarrhea), general

Common toxicities for trametinib were similar across
studies, with the dominant events in skin (rash), gastroin-
testinal
(edema), and constitutional
(fatigue) systems [63–65]. Dose-limiting toxicities were
similar but were also observed to include central serous
retinopathy. At doses of 2 mg, skin toxicity was observed
at a rate of 48–91 % across studies and diarrhea with an
incidence of 28–58 %. Other notable toxicities at 2 mg

MEK Inhibitors for Cancer

included cardiac toxicity (ejection fraction reduction or
ventricular dysfunction in 3–21 % of patients), ocular
toxicity (blurred vision, reversible chorioretinopathy or
retinal vein occlusion in 6–21 % of patients), hepatitis
(7–15 % of patients), and pneumonitis (\5 %).

4.2 Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886)

4.2.1 Preclinical Data

Selumetinib is a selective, ATP non-competitive inhibitor
of MEK1 and MEK2 at an IC50 of approximately
10–14 gM [50, 68]. Selumetinib is metabolized to N-
desmethyl AZD6244, a compound with greater MEK-
inhibiting capacity, three times greater downstream ERK
suppression and three times greater reduction of cell via-
bility relative to the parent compound. The selectivity of
selumetinib for MEK has been documented against a panel
of kinases up to concentrations of 10 lM [68]. Selumetinib
has anti-tumor activity in BRAF and NRAS mutant pre-
clinical models including cell lines and xenografts from
melanoma, pancreatic, lung, colon, breast, and hepatocel-
lular carcinoma [50, 68, 69].

4.2.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism

Ò

The initial formulation of selumetinib was an oral sus-
pension requiring reconstitution from free base in an
sulphobutylether b-cyclodextrin
solution of
aqueous
(Captisol
) [70]. Despite pharmacological animal studies
suggesting good oral bioavailability, absorption was dose
limited and drug administration was inconvenient. The
drug was therefore reformulated as the hydrogen sulfate
salt (AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate). Subsequent studies suggest
dose-proportional bioavailability [71]. Steady-state phar-
macokinetic evaluation suggests a Cmax of approximately
1 h, a half-life of 12 h, and time-independent kinetics
based on comparison of day 1 and day 15 drug levels.
Excretion of selumetinib is predominantly via the feces,
with the majority of metabolites undergoing glucuronida-
tion. Selumetinib is metabolized by CYP, with predomi-
nant activity by CYP1A2, 2C19, and 3A4 [72].

4.2.3 Clinical Experience

Phase I experience with selumetinib conﬁrmed RP2D of
100 mg twice daily on a 28-day administration schedule
[71]. Selumetinib was then evaluated in a wide range of
unselected but MAPK-activated enriched tumors including
biliary, colorectal, pancreatic, NSCLC, and melanoma. In
patients with melanoma, a similar RR (5.8 %) and PFS
(2.5 months) were observed for selumetinib as compared
with temozolomide [73]. In patients with BRAF mutant

tumors, the RR was 11.1 %, which is not different from
that for temozolomide. In patients with pancreatic cancer,
OS in the second line after gemcitabine with selumetinib or
capcitabine was found to be similar (5.4 months) [74]. In
patients with NSCLC who had progressed through at least
two prior lines of treatment, selumetinib appeared similar
to pemetrexed in terms of median PFS (3 months) [75].
Similarly, in colorectal cancer, PFS of selumetinib was
similar to capecitabine (2.8 months) [76]. In patients with
biliary tract cancers who had progressed on one line of
prior chemotherapy, a single-arm phase II study suggested
a RR of 12 % and PFS of 3.7 months [77]. In previously
untreated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,
median time to progression was 8 weeks; three transient
objective tumor responses were observed [78]. In an open-
label phase II study of patients with low-grade serous
carcinoma of the ovary, a disease commonly characterized
by mutations in BRAF, an RR of 15 % was observed. This
was considered useful when compared with the historical
standard of care with chemotherapy where responses are
very rare [79].

improvement

The clinical activity of selumetinib was more impressive
when patients were selected based on mutational status of
KRAS or BRAF. In melanoma, trials including patients
with both BRAF V600E and BRAF wild-type tumors in
particular have been pursued. In V600E BRAF patients, a
phase II combination of DTIC with and without selumeti-
nib reported a signiﬁcant
in the PFS of
patients treated with selumetinib as opposed to placebo:
5.6 months versus 3.0 months (p = 0.021), respectively.
No improvement in OS was seen, and toxicity consistent
with both agents was observed [80]. In a phase II study of
selumetinib in BRAF V600E melanoma stratiﬁed by
phosphorylated AKT (high vs. low), no responses were
seen in the AKT high cohort, whereas a 20 % RR was
observed in the AKT low cohort [81]. In BRAF wild-type
melanoma, the combination of docetaxel with selumetinib
had a similar PFS to docetaxel alone (4 months). The RR
for the combination was higher, but
toxicity was also
increased [82]. In uveal melanoma, a chemotherapy-resis-
tant melanoma subtype where mutations in the G-coupled
protein receptors GNAQ and GNA11 are found in 85 % of
tumors eventually leading to MAPK activation [83], tumor
regression and RR were found to be 50 and 15 %,
respectively [84]. In KRAS mutant NSCLC, the combi-
nation of docetaxel and selumetinib showed a signiﬁcantly
improved RR (37 vs. 0 %, p \ 0.0001) and PFS (5.3 vs.
2.1 months, p = 0.014). OS was not improved, and tox-
icity was greater with the combination treatment [85].

Finally, selumetinib appears to inﬂuence the biology of
thyroid cancer. In iodine-refractory papillary thyroid can-
cer, a median PFS of 32 weeks was observed. In patients
with tumors harboringV600E BRAF mutation, PFS was

2118

J. J. Luke et al.

longer (33 vs. 11 weeks) [86]. Further, a phase II study was
performed in which selumetinib was administered with the
intent of reversing refractory status to radioiodine in
patients with metastatic thyroid cancer [87]. In four of nine
patients with BRAF mutant tumors and ﬁve of ﬁve patients
with NRAS mutant tumors, treatment with selumetinib led
to increased uptake of iodine-124. In 8 of 12 patients, the
dosimetry threshold for radioiodine therapy was reached
and, in these eight patients, ﬁve patients experienced partial
response (PR) and three patients experienced stable disease
(SD). All of these patients demonstrated decreased levels
of serum thyroglobulin levels, with a mean reduction of
89 %.

4.2.4 Safety Proﬁle

The most common adverse events reported in human trials
of selumetinib include fatigue (71 %), nausea (54 %),
vomiting (27 %), diarrhea (48.2), edema (43 %), and
dyspnea (29 %) [71]. Serious adverse events associated
with selumetinib have notably included hypoxia (\1 %),
pyrexia (\1 %), and visual disturbances (including serous
retinal detachment, 10 %).

4.3 Cobimetinib (GDC-0973, XL518)

4.3.1 Preclinical Data

Cobimetinib is a potent and highly selective allosteric
inhibitor of MEK1/2, with a MEK1 IC50 of 4.2 gM [88].
Efﬁcacy in vivo has been demonstrated in BRAF and
KRAS mutant cell lines [88, 89]. Cobimetinib showed
inhibition of tumor growth in a dose-dependent fashion up
to 10 mg/kg in Colo205 (V600E BRAF) tumor xenografts.
Pharmacodynamic parameters estimated the 50 % knock-
down concentration (KC50) as 0.39 lM. Total concentra-
tion required for tumor stasis was 0.05 lM [90]. An esti-
mated IC50
cobimetinib of
phosphorylated ERK in xenograft mice were 0.78 and
0.52 lmol/L in tumor models WM-266-4 and A375,
respectively. Multiple dosing increased the IC50 [91].

single doses of

after

4.3.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism

Cobimetinib has exhibited variable absorption in cancer
patients. Absolute bioavailability of cobimetinib is descri-
bed as 46.2 %, with mean clearance of 11.7 L/h. The half-
life of cobimetinib is described as demonstrating dose-
proportional and time-independent pharmacokinetics, with
a half-life of 2.0 days [92]. A high-fat diet delays absorp-
tion with prolonged time to Cmax (Tmax) but does not affect
exposure or AUC. Overall, oral administration of cobi-
metinib is not affected by food or gastric pH.

4.3.3 Clinical Experience

In the phase I monotherapy study of cobimetinib, multiple
schedules were evaluated with maximum tolerated doses of
cobimetinib established as 100 mg 14 days on/14 days off and
60 mg 21 days on/7 days off [93]. No efﬁcacy data of cobi-
metinib as a single agent in the treatment of human cancers
have been released to date. However, cobimetinib has been
evaluated in multiple schedules in combination with the V600
BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib [94]. A multi-factorial dose-
escalation phase I study was pursued in which vemurafenib at
both 720 or 960 mg twice daily was evaluated with cobimet-
inib at 60, 80, or 100 mg in schedules including 14 days on/
14 days off, 21 days on/7 days off, or continuously. Two dose
levels were expanded, including vemurafenib 720 mg and
960 mg twice daily plus cobimetinib 60 mg daily 21 days on/
7 days off. When assessing beneﬁt in patients previously
treated with vemurafenib, a 15 % RR and 43 % SD rate were
observed in the expansion arms. The median PFS for patients
who had previously progressed on vemurafenib was
2.8 months. In those patients not previously treated with
BRAF inhibitors, an RR of 85 and 10 % complete RR was
observed. In BRAF inhibitor-untreated patients, the median
PFS was not reached at a median follow-up of 10 months.

4.3.4 Safety Proﬁle

Common adverse events associated with single-agent co-
bimetinib include diarrhea, rash, pruritus, nausea, vomit-
ing, blurred and impaired vision, fatigue, and abdominal
pain [93]. In combination with vemurafenib,
the most
frequent adverse events observed included diarrhea (48 %),
non-acneiform rash (35 %), nausea (32 %), photosensitiv-
ity/sunburn (29 %), fatigue (28 %), and liver test abnor-
mality (25 %) [94].

4.4 Refametinib (BAY 86-9766, RDEA119)

4.4.1 Preclinical Data

Refametinib is a potent, non-ATP-competitive, highly
selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 with an
IC50 of 19 and 47 gmol/L, respectively. Refametinib has
exhibited activity against V600E BRAF mutant cell lines,
with 50 % growth inhibition concentration (GI50) values
ranging from 40 to 84 gmol/L, and tumor reduction in
A375 melanoma, Colo205 colorectal, and OCIP19 pan-
creatic carcinoma xenografts [95, 96].

4.4.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism

Refametinib demonstrates a median Tmax of 2 h with an
elimination half-life (T) of 12 h after single dosing. Dose-

MEK Inhibitors for Cancer

proportional Cmax and steady-state AUC were observed
between a 2–100 mg dosing range on a daily schedule [97].

4.4.3 Clinical Experience

The RP2D of refametinib is 100 mg daily [97]. Activity
was observed in the phase I study in BRAF and KRAS
mutant tumors. Refametinib was also dose escalated in
combination with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 daily, where
an RP2D of 30 mg twice per day was determined [98].

4.4.4 Safety Proﬁle

Common treatment-related adverse events include derma-
tologic toxicity such as primarily acneiform dermatitis
(33 %), maculopapular rash (20 %), as well as nausea
(29 %), vomiting (26 %), diarrhea (32 %), edema (28 %),
and fatigue (26 %) [97].

4.5 Binimetinib (MEK162, ARRY-438162)

4.5.1 Preclinical

Binimetinib inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 in a potent and
selective non-ATP competitive manner (IC50 = 12 gM).
Binimetinib has been documented to inhibit proliferation
and reduce tumor volume in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF
mutant as well as non-MAPK activities in vitro and in vivo
cell line and tumor models [99].

4.5.2 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

The pharmacokinetics of binimetinib are linear, and the drug
exhibits moderate oral bioavailability in all species tested. It
is highly protein bound in plasma and somewhat more dis-
tributed in plasma than blood. Binimetinib has multiple
routes of metabolism; however, glucuronidation (predomi-
nately through UGT1A1) appears to be most common, with
excretion nearly evenly split between urine and feces. Bin-
imetinib has limited effects on relevant CYP enzyme family
members. The human T is approximately 8 h [100].

4.5.3 Clinical Experience

Binimetinib is dosed as 45 or 60 mg daily or twice daily
[100, 101]. In a phase II study of binimetinib in melanoma,
a 20 % RR was observed for both patients with advanced
NRAS mutant and those with BRAF mutant melanoma
[101]. The activity of binimetinib is also being evaluated in
biliary tract tumors, where a PR and a complete response
have been observed. Notably, these patients were found not
to harbor RAS- or RAF-activating mutations [102]. Results
from a combination phase I/II study of binimetinib with the

selective BRAF inhibitor LGX818 have also described a
dosing regimen of LGX818 at 450 mg daily with bini-
metinib 45 mg twice daily as a tolerable regimen. Early
indications of efﬁcacy for this combination in melanoma
have described an RR of 71 % was seen in patients with
non-previously treated BRAF mutant disease as well as
22 % in those who were previously treated with a BRAF
inhibitor [103].

4.5.4 Safety

Frequently reported adverse events associated with binimet-
inib include rash (79 %), diarrhea (32 %), edema (32 %),
nausea (43 %), fatigue (29 %), and vomiting (36 %) [102].

4.6 Pimasertib (AS703026, MSC1936369B)

4.6.1 Preclinical

Pimasertib is a selective and potent oral ATP uncompetitive
inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 that has demonstrated anti-
tumor activity in multiple preclinical models, with special
focus on RAS-driven tumors (myeloma, pancreas, lung,
colon cancers) [104, 105]. Biomarker analysis of 12-O-
Tetradecanoylphorbol-I3-acetate-stimulated
(MAPK-acti-
vated) leukocytes indicated a consistent inhibition of ERK
phosphorylation by pimasertib [105]. Further, pimasertib has
shown a potential for combination therapy. Studies with
PI3K pathway inhibitors or various chemotherapies have
shown synergistic activity on tumor growth inhibition [106].

4.6.2 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

Human pharmacokinetic data have not been publicly dis-
closed regarding pimasertib. One study evaluating drug
exposure in murine brain and glioblastoma models has
suggested a Tmax in the brain of 1 h associated with a 90 %
inhibition of phosphorylated ERK [107].

4.6.3 Clinical Activity

Pimasertib has been evaluated in several RAS and RAF
tumors. In a phase I study of pimasertib with
mutant
5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU),
irinotecan, and leucovorin, dose-
limiting toxicity limited the escalation of pimasertib, and
this combination was abandoned [108]. Other combination
approaches have included dose escalation with the PI3K/
mammalian target of
inhibitor
SAR245409 and gemcitabine.
In combination with
SAR245409, doses of pimasertib 60 mg twice daily with
70 mg of SAR245409 was determined to be the RP2D,
with PRs being observed in patients with KRAS mutant
colorectal carcinoma and low-grade ovarian cancer [109].

rapamycin (mTOR)

J. J. Luke et al.

Activity of pimasertib has also been observed in combi-
nation with gemcitabine in pancreatic carcinoma. In com-
bination with gemcitabine, pimasertib 60 mg twice daily,
continuous dosing was deemed the RP2D; PR was
observed in 19 % of patients, and SD for greater than 3
months was seen in 25 % of patients [110].

4.6.4 Safety

Toxicity has yet to be widely reported; however, common
toxicities have been similar to MEK inhibitor class effects
and include retinal vein occlusion, ocular events, diarrhea,
asthenia, edema, vomiting, and nausea.

4.7 RO4987655

4.7.1 Preclinical

RO4987655 is a potent, highly selective non-ATP-compet-
itive inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2. Anti-tumor activity in
preclinical models of melanoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and
colorectal cancer has been observed with RO4987655 as a
single agent as well as in combination with chemotherapies
such as paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin [111].

4.7.2 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

RO4987655 demonstrates dose-proportional pharmacoki-
netics by Cmax and AUC as well as rapid bioavailability,
with a median Tmax of approximately 1 h (range 0.5–2)
[112]. The human mean terminal T was demonstrated as
12 h with an effective T of 9 h. RO4987655 demonstrates
biphasic elimination with multiple routes of elimination;
however, renal elimination is minimal. The major metab-
olite of RO4987655 is a ring-open structure, although
oxidative metabolites are also observed.

4.7.3 Clinical Activity

RO4987655 has been evaluated in several expansion arms
of the phase I dose-escalation study including melanoma,
NSCLC, and colorectal carcinoma [113]. Among patients
with melanoma, four of 18 (24 %) BRAF mutant and four
of 20 (20 %) BRAF WT had a response, with PR as best
response in these cohorts. Among patients with KRAS
mutant NSCLC, two of 18 patients had response (all PR),
while none of the 18 patients with KRAS mutant colorectal
carcinoma had a response.

4.7.4 Safety

Toxicities observed with RO4987655 have been similar to
those described with other MEK inhibitors [113]. Common

toxicities have included those that were skin related (rash
and acneiform dermatitis), gastrointestinal disorders (nau-
sea, vomiting, diarrhea), ocular (serous retinal detachment
and blurred vision), and general (peripheral edema and
asthenia). The majority of grade 3–4 adverse events
included asymptomatic increase of creatine phosphokinase
(23 %), rash (16 %), diarrhea (8 %), folliculitis (7 %),
super-infected dermatitis
retinal
detachment (7 %).

5 Next Steps for MEK Inhibitors

With the approval of trametinib, MEK inhibition has
entered the clinical area as a standard of care option.
Multiple studies are ongoing with MEK inhibitors as single
agents (Table 2). Beyond V600 BRAF, other melanoma
subtypes may also be sensitive enough to MEK mono-
therapy to justify approval of MEK inhibitors for clinical
practice. In other molecular subsets, such as RAS mutant
histologies, this question is more open.

A robust preclinical literature suggests that combining
MEK inhibition may be additive or synergistic with other
treatments. While monotherapy with MEK inhibition does
have interesting activity in several diseases, combination
strategies with other treatment approaches such as che-
motherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy also
appear promising. Table 3 describes ongoing combination
trials with MEK inhibitors. To date, the development of
these approaches has been limited by toxicity, and this
highlights an important difference between MEK inhibition
and V600 BRAF inhibition. Mutation of BRAF at V600
generates a new enzyme target for drug development. This
tumor-speciﬁc mutation facilitates a wider ‘therapeutic
window’, allowing administration of a much higher dosage
of BRAF inhibition prior to the development of dose-lim-
iting toxicity [114]. This is in contrast to MEK inhibition,
which targets the physiologic MAPKK proteins on which
nearly all cells depend to some degree. As such, the ther-
apeutic window for MEK inhibition is much smaller than
for V600 BRAF and limits dose escalation.

This difference in mutant versus physiologic protein
targets manifests particularly in the setting of combination
therapy. For reasons that have been well described previ-
ously [19, 54], combination approaches of V600 BRAF and
MEK inhibition are synergistic and reduce the toxicity of
BRAF inhibition alone [66]. However, synergy is not
necessarily expected with other combinations (e.g. MEK
inhibitor plus PI3K, AKT inhibitor or chemotherapy, etc.).
This has borne out in phase I studies where it has not been
possible to optimally dose escalate MEK inhibitors with
other drugs and the observed efﬁcacy has been limited
[115, 116].

The utility of MEK inhibition will also have to be clo-
sely considered in the setting of a new class of immuno-
therapeutic agents that are of increasing interest in cancer
treatment. These immune-checkpoint blockade approaches,
such as anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies,
rely on an activated T-cell response as the anti-tumor
agent. Laboratory experiments have suggested that inhibi-
tion of MEK may have immune-dampening effects via
blockade of the MAPK pathway during T-cell activation.
Whether the combination of MEK inhibitors and immu-
notherapy is an appropriate approach for optimal anti-
tumor effect will have to be closely investigated [117].
Thus, much is yet to be learned regarding the combining of
MEK inhibitors with chemotherapy and immunotherapy
[118].

With these caveats, MEK inhibition is clearly an
important area of drug development that has advanced
tremendously over the past decade. While the development
of MEK inhibitors as single agents may be appropriate in
some settings, it seems likely that combination approaches
with other agents will be the most highly efﬁcacious
strategies in many cancers. Furthermore, it may be that the
dosing schedule of MEK inhibitors is an important con-
sideration in their clinical utility. Preclinical models have
suggested that intermittent dosing approaches may be more
appropriate to avoid genetic and molecular
feedback
resistance through the MAPK pathway [119]. Clearly,
further research into these areas will be required to opti-
mize the utility of MEK inhibition in the treatment of
patients with cancer.
