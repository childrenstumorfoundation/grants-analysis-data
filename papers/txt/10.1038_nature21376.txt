The prefrontal cortex is a critical neuroanatomical hub for 
controlling motivated behaviours across mammalian species1–3. In 
addition to intra-cortical connectivity, prefrontal projection neurons 
innervate subcortical structures that contribute to reward-seeking 
behaviours, such as the ventral striatum and midline thalamus4. 
While connectivity among these structures contributes to appetitive 
behaviours5–13, how projection-specific prefrontal neurons encode 
reward-relevant information to guide reward seeking is unknown. 
Here we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the 
activity of dorsomedial prefrontal neurons in mice during an 
appetitive Pavlovian conditioning task. At the population level, these 
neurons display diverse activity patterns during the presentation 
of reward-predictive cues. However, recordings from prefrontal 
neurons with resolved projection targets reveal that individual 
corticostriatal neurons show response tuning to reward-predictive 
cues, such that excitatory cue responses are amplified across 
learning. By contrast, corticothalamic neurons gradually develop 
new, primarily inhibitory responses to reward-predictive cues across 
learning. Furthermore, bidirectional optogenetic manipulation of 
these neurons reveals that stimulation of corticostriatal neurons 
promotes conditioned reward-seeking behaviour after learning, 
while activity in corticothalamic neurons suppresses both the 
acquisition and expression of conditioned reward seeking. These 
data show how prefrontal circuitry can dynamically control reward-
seeking behaviour through the opposing activities of projection-
specific cell populations.

Neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) respond diversely to 
reward-predictive cues14–17, although how this cue encoding fits into 
a broader circuitry to guide reward seeking is unknown. To address 
this, we designed a Pavlovian conditioning task that allows two-photon  
imaging of deep cortical tissue during behaviour. Head-fixed mice 
were trained to associate one conditioned stimulus (CS+), but not 
another (CS−), with sucrose (Fig. 1a, b). Following multiple train-
ing sessions, mice behaviourally discriminated between the cues by 
displaying anticipatory licks to the CS+ but not CS− (Fig. 1c), con-
firming that the cue-reward contingencies had been established by the 
later sessions (Fig. 1d, e; Extended Data Fig. 1). To monitor neural 
activity during this task, we injected a virus into dorsomedial PFC 
for delivery of a calcium indicator18 under the control of the calcium/
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (Camk2a) promoter 
(AAVdj-CaMK2a-GCaMP6s; Fig. 1f), which putatively targets cortical  
excitatory neurons19. Ex vivo brain slice recordings revealed 
that fluorescent deflections of GCaMP6s-expressing PFC neu-
rons reliably tracked elevations and reductions in action potential  
frequency, whereas hyperpolarization from rest alone did not influence 
GCaMP6s-mediated fluorescence (Extended Data Fig. 2). Next, we 
implanted optical cannulae approximately 2.2 mm beneath the surface 
of the brain, allowing chronic optical access to hundreds of dorsomedial 

PFC neurons in each awake, behaving mouse (Fig. 1g–i; Supplementary 
Video 1). Collectively, we recorded from GCaMP6s-expressing PFC 
neurons before learning (n =  1,473) and after learning (n =  1,569), and 
found that while many of these neurons displayed increased activity 
in response to reward-predictive cues, other neurons exhibited inhib-
itory cue responses (Fig. 1j, k, n, o). These responses were most prev-
alent during presentation of the CS+, but not the CS−, after learning  
(Fig. 1l, m, p, q; Extended Data Figs 3a, b and 4a–c). Thus, the responses 
of many individual PFC neurons could be used to decode whether the 
CS+ or CS− was presented on any given trial after learning (Extended 
Data Fig. 4d).

We found that many dorsomedial PFC neurons encoded cues after 
learning; however, both inhibitory and excitatory responses were com-
mon. Considering this, it is possible that distinct populations of neurons 
in the PFC have opposing cue-encoding properties. Two major projec-
tion targets of the PFC are the nucleus accumbens (PFC–NAc) and 
paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PFC–PVT)4,20. Furthermore, 
studies examining reward seeking in rodent addiction models have 
found that PFC–NAc neurons express immediate early genes following 
cue-induced relapse21,22, and inhibition of these cells can prevent drug 
seeking6–8,12. Additionally, reward-predictive cues may influence the 
activity of PVT neurons23, and such activity is thought to modulate cue 
salience24 and conditioned behaviours25,26. Thus, we hypothesized that 
PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons encode reward-predictive stimuli to 
orchestrate appetitive learning. To test this hypothesis, we first deter-
mined whether PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons are distinct or over-
lapping populations of neurons. We injected retrograde cholera toxins 
conjugated to different fluorophores into NAc and PVT of the same 
mice. Electrophysiological recordings and histological analysis revealed 
that PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons are physiologically distinct 
and anatomically segregated within dorsomedial PFC (Extended Data  
Fig. 5), such that PFC–NAc neurons are in layers II/III and V (46% 
layer II/III, 51% layer V, 4% layer VI) whereas PFC–PVT neurons are 
predominantly in layer VI (0% layer II/III, 20% layer V, 79% layer VI). 
These data are consistent with anatomical studies, as corticostriatal 
projection neurons reside in layers II/III and V in rats, whereas layer 
VI is specific for corticothalamic neurons27,28. Furthermore, using a 
retrograde rabies tracing strategy to sparsely label PFC–NAc or PFC–
PVT neurons as well as their afferent inputs, we found that these cell 
populations have both shared and unshared afferent connectivity 
(Extended Data Fig. 6). Finally, PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons 
express CaMK2a (Extended Data Fig. 7a–d), collectively revealing 
that these neurons make up two non-overlapping subpopulations of 
CaMK2a-expressing projection neurons.

We next targeted PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons for in vivo 
two-photon calcium imaging. Cre-inducible GCaMP6s (AAVdj-DIO-
GCaMP6s) was injected into dorsomedial PFC, and in the same surgery

m, Population data of all neurons show many excitatory (red) or inhibitory

Cre-recombinase (Cav2-Cre), was injected into either the NAc or PVT 
(Fig. 2a, g). This resulted in projection-specific GCaMP6s expression in 
PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons (Fig. 2b, h; Extended Data Fig. 7e–j).  
Next, mice underwent Pavlovian conditioning with simultaneous 
head-fixed two-photon calcium imaging. Data revealed that after learn-
ing, but not before learning, PFC–NAc neurons primarily displayed 
excitation to the CS+, whereas fewer neurons responded to the CS−  
(Fig. 2c–e; Extended Data Fig. 3c, d). By contrast, PFC–PVT neurons 
primarily displayed inhibition to the CS+ after learning, whereas fewer 
neurons responded to the CS− (Fig. 2i–k; Extended Data Fig. 3e, f). 
Finally, we found that activity in either PFC–NAc neurons (Fig. 2f) or 
PFC–PVT neurons (Fig. 2l) could be used to decode whether the CS+ 
or CS− was presented on any given trial after learning.

We found that PFC–NAc neurons and PFC–PVT neurons show 
distinct cue-encoding profiles after learning, but how these response 
properties emerge across learning was unclear. To examine this, we 
identified individual PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons whose activity 
could reliably be monitored throughout training (Fig. 3a, d). We found 
that many PFC–NAc neurons initially displayed low amplitude, phasic 
calcium transients to both the CS− and CS+, such that there was little 
cue discrimination (Fig. 3b). However, across learning the responses 
of individual PFC–NAc neurons became selective, such that responses 
to the CS+ were amplified and responses to the CS− were diminished  
(Fig. 3b, c). In contrast to this response tuning in PFC–NAc neurons, 
PFC–PVT neurons showed little response to either the CS+ or CS− 
before learning, but instead many neurons acquired new inhibitory 

responses after learning (Fig. 3e, f). Thus, the responses of PFC–NAc, 
but not PFC–PVT, neurons after learning could be predicted on the 
basis of responses before learning (Fig. 3c, f, correlations). Collectively, 
corticostriatal and corticothalamic neurons showed distinct functional 
plasticity across appetitive learning, such that PFC–NAc neurons 
adjusted their activity to allow cue discrimination, whereas PFC–PVT 
neurons gradually acquired responses for cue discrimination.

Our data reveal that projection-specific PFC neurons show distinct 
cue encoding properties across appetitive learning. However, whether 
this activity controls the acquisition of conditioned reward seeking is 
unclear. To test this, we targeted PFC–NAc or PFC–PVT neurons for 
optogenetic manipulation by injecting Cav2-Cre into the NAc or PVT, 
and Cre-inducible channelrhodopsin-2 (AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP), 
halorhodopsin (AAV5-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP), or control (AAV5-
DIO-eYFP) into dorsomedial PFC (Fig. 4a–c, j–l). Next, we optogeneti-
cally manipulated these cells during cue delivery throughout Pavlovian 
conditioning (sessions 1–8; Fig. 4d–f, m–o), and tested the effects on 
acquisition of this task during a subsequent test without laser. Data 
reveal that activation (in PFC–NAc::ChR2 mice) or inactivation (in 
PFC–NAc::eNpHR3.0 mice) of PFC–NAc neurons did not influence 
CS+-evoked anticipatory licking during the no-laser test (Fig. 4g–i), 
implying that these cells do not control the acquisition of anticipatory 
licking. By contrast, optogenetic activation of PFC–PVT neurons (in 
PFC–PVT::ChR2 mice) reduced CS+-evoked anticipatory licking dur-
ing the no-laser test, whereas optogenetic inactivation of PFC–PVT 
neurons (in PFC–PVT::eNpHR3.0 mice) increased anticipatory licking

(2) =  2.02, P >  0.35); however, 
(2) =  43.86, 

during the no-laser test (Fig. 4p–r). Thus, inhibitory cue encoding in 
PFC–PVT neurons, but not PFC–NAc neurons, contributes to the 
acquisition of conditioned reward seeking.

Although activity in PFC–NAc neurons did not control the acqui-
sition of conditioned reward seeking, differences in licking behaviour 

were apparent between groups during the laser conditioning sessions 
(sessions 1–8; see Fig. 4g, h). Thus, one possibility is that PFC–NAc 
neurons control the expression of conditioned reward seeking, rather 
than acquisition. To test this directly, we next performed the opto-
genetic manipulations after conditioning in separate groups of mice.

showing CS+ lick rate during conditioning (with laser) and test (no laser). 
h, i, CDF plots and bar graphs showing CS+ lick rate during conditioning 
(h) and test (i). No differences were observed between PFC–NAc groups 
during the no-laser test (ChR2 versus eYFP: auROC  =  0.43; P =  0.48; 
eNpHR3.0 versus eYFP: auROC =  0.51, P =  0.48). auROC is a statistical 
test that compares the likelihood that lick rates from the two groups 
represent the same population (auROC ≈  0.5) or different populations 
(auROC =  0 or auROC =  1 suggests that lick rates were higher for one 

cue on 100% of the trials as compared to the other cue). j–l, Viral strategy 
(j) for PFC–PVT optogenetic experiments resulted in eYFP expression 
in PFC–PVT neurons (k, l). m–o, Example peri-event rasters (top) and 
histograms (bottom; blue lines refer to laser sessions (day 1, day 4 and day 8)  
and black line refers to no-laser test) from PFC–PVT::ChR2 (n =  6), 
PFC–PVT::eNpHR3.0 (n =  5), and PFC–PVT::eYFP mice (n =  10). p, Line 
graph showing average CS+ lick rate during all conditioning sessions (with 
laser) and test (no laser). q, r, CDF plots and bar graphs showing CS+ 
lick rate during all laser sessions (q) and during the no-laser test (r). CS+ 
lick rate was reduced in PFC–PVT::ChR2 mice (versus PFC–PVT::eYFP 
mice: auROC =  0.09, * P =  0.01) and enhanced in PFC–PVT::eNpHR3.0 
mice (versus PFC–PVT::eYFP mice: auROC =  0.84, * P =  0.02). Line and 
bar graphs represent the mean ±  s.e.m. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; cc, 
corpus callosum; ILc, infralimbic cortex; NL, no-laser test; PLc, prelimbic 
cortex.

We found that optogenetic activation of PFC–NAc neurons during the 
CS+ increased anticipatory licking (Fig. 5a, c, d, f), whereas inactivation 
of PFC–NAc neurons reduced anticipatory licking (Fig. 5b, c, e, f). 
By contrast, optogenetic activation of PFC–PVT neurons during the 
CS+ reduced anticipatory licking (Fig. 5g, i, j, l) whereas inactivation 
of PFC–PVT neurons had no effect (Fig. 5h, i, k, l). The lack of effect 
for PFC–PVT inactivation is probably due to CS+-evoked inhibition 
of these cells (see Figs 2 and 3), as neuronal hyperpolarization from 
sub-threshold potentials should not result in further adjustment of neu-
ronal output. Collectively, activation of PFC–NAc neurons and inhi-
bition of PFC–PVT neurons supports the expression of conditioned 
reward seeking.

In addition to encoding the reward-predictive stimulus after learn-
ing, some PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons displayed CS− encoding 
(see Fig. 2). Considering this, we also evaluated how projection- 
specific cells influenced licking during the CS−. We found that opto-
genetic perturbations of PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons during 
the CS− did not influence the acquisition of CS− licking (Extended 
Data Fig. 8a–f). By contrast, inactivation but not activation of PFC–
NAc neurons reduced the expression of CS− licking, whereas opto-
genetic manipulations of PFC–PVT neurons had no effect on the 
expression of CS− licking (Extended Data Fig. 8g–l). Moreover, 
optogenetic manipulation of PFC–NAc or PFC–PVT neurons 

during random time epochs outside of cue delivery had no effect on 
licking (Extended Data Fig. 9), nor did optogenetic manipulations 
produce a real-time place preference or aversion (Extended Data  
Fig. 10). These results suggest that activity in PFC–NAc and PFC–
PVT neurons specifically during the cue period is critical for condi-
tioned reward seeking.

Here we found that the opposing population dynamics of prefrontal 
output circuits orchestrates conditioned reward seeking. In addition to 
divergent population encoding, subsets of cells in both corticostriatal 
and corticothalamic circuits have response profiles that are opposite to 
the overall population (that is, some PFC–NAc neurons have inhibi-
tory CS+ responses, whereas some PFC–PVT cells have excitatory CS+ 
responses). Although the cause and function of such heterogeneity is 
unclear, it is possible that subpopulations of cells within each group 
may have distinct cell-type-specific targets, afferent inputs, and spatial 
locations. Thus, while it remains unclear how all cells in PFC func-
tion to orchestrate reward seeking, our data suggest that projection- 
specific and anatomically segregated prefrontal neurons can have 
opposing activity dynamics, plasticity profiles, and functional control 
of conditioned reward seeking.

Subjects and surgery. Adult male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) or Ai9 
reporter mice (Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)HzeIJ; Jackson Laboratories) 
were group housed (25–35 g; 6–8 weeks old) with littermates until surgery. For 
all experiments, mice underwent surgery during which they were anaesthetized 
with 0.8–1.5% isoflurane vaporized in pure oxygen (1 l min−1) and placed within 
a stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments). Ophthalmic ointment (Akorn) 
and a topical anaesthetic (2% lidocaine; Akorn) were applied during surgeries, 
and subcutaneous injections of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl in water) were adminis-
tered to prevent dehydration. During surgeries, virus injections were administered 
unilaterally (for two-photon microscopy experiments) or bilaterally (for optoge-
netics or anatomical experiments) targeting dorsal medial PFC (specifically pre-
limbic cortex; 500 nl per side; relative to bregma: AP, + 1.85 mm; ML, ± 0.60 mm; 
DV, − 2.50 mm), bilaterally targeting NAc (500 nl per side; relative to bregma: AP,  
+ 1.42 mm; ML ± 0.73 mm; DV, − 4.80 mm), and/or on the midline targeting PVT 
(300 nl; relative to bregma: AP, − 1.46 mm; ML, − 1.13 mm; DV, − 3.30 mm; 20° 
angle). The UNC Vector Core packaged all viruses except canine adenovirus  
2 encoding Cre (Cav2-Cre; Institut de Génétique Moléculaire de Montpellier). For 
two-photon imaging experiments, an optical cannula (Inscopix) was implanted 
above the PFC injection site (relative to bregma: AP, + 1.85 mm; ML, − 0.8 mm; 
DV, − 2.2 mm; see ref. 29 for details of using similar surgical protocols for imaging 
experiments). For optogenetic experiments, custom-made optical fibres30 were 
implanted bilaterally approximately 0.5 mm above the PFC injection sites (relative 
to bregma: AP, + 1.85 mm; ML, ± 0.83 mm; DV, − 1.93 mm; 10° angle). For experi-
ments involving head-fixed behaviour, a custom-made ring (stainless steel; 5 mm 
ID, 11 mm OD) was attached to the skull during surgery to allow head fixation 
(see Fig. 1a). Following surgeries, mice received acetaminophen in their drinking 
water for two days, and were allowed to recover with access to food and water  
ad libitum for at least 21 days. After recovery, mice were water restricted (water 
bottles taken out of the cage), and 0.6 ml of water was delivered every day to a dish 
placed within each home cage. Behavioural experiments began when mice weighed 
less than 90% of free drinking weight (around 10 days for all experiments). To 
ensure good health and weight maintenance, mice were weighed and handled daily. 
This protocol resulted in weight stabilization between 85–90% of free-drinking 
weight during each experiment. No mouse was given more or less than 0.6 ml 
of water for weight concerns during water restriction procedures, nor did any 
health problems related to dehydration arise at any point from these protocols. 
All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for 
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health), and were 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University 
of North Carolina prior to experiments commencing.
Head-fixed behaviour. Following recovery from surgery, mice were habituated to 
head fixation for 3 days, during which unpredictable drops of sucrose (10% sucrose 
in water; 2.0–2.5 μ l) were delivered intermittently for one hour (approximately  
60 drops per hour) through a gravity-driven, solenoid-controlled lick tube. Once 
the mice displayed sufficient licking (> 1,000 licks per session), they underwent 
Pavlovian conditioning. During each conditioning session, two cues (3 kHz pulsing 
or 12 kHz constant tones, 2 s, 70 dB) were randomly presented 50 times before the 
delivery of sucrose (CS+, 10% sucrose in water; 2.0–2.5 μ l) or no sucrose (CS−), 
such that there was a one second trace interval between delivery of the CS+ and 
sucrose (see Fig. 1b). The cue contingencies were counterbalanced across cohorts 
of mice to ensure that mice acquired conditioned licking in response to either 
tone when paired with sucrose. The inter-trial interval between the previous 
reward delivery (CS+) or withholding time (CS−) and the next cue was chosen 
as a random sample from a uniform distribution bounded by 40 s and 80 s. Cue 
discrimination was quantified using the area under a receiver operating charac-
teristic (auROC) formed by the number of baseline-subtracted licks during the 
CS+ versus CS− trace intervals. For both two-photon and optogenetic behavioural 
experiments, we classified sessions as ‘early’ or ‘late’ in learning, defined by both 
behavioural performance (early, auROC <  0.65; late, auROC >  0.66) and session 
number (early, sessions 1–5; late, sessions 7 or later). These criteria were used as 
post hoc analysis revealed that an auROC >  0.66 approximates high performance in 
a phase space formed by behavioural performance across sessions. Finally, behavi-
oural data are displayed and analysed throughout the manuscript as the change in 
lick rate between each 3-s cue period and 1-s baseline period (baseline period is 
immediately before each cue). In addition, we show raw lick rates during both the 
cue and baseline periods for all imaging experiments (see Extended Data Fig. 1). 
Baseline lick rates remained relatively low across all experiments, and therefore for 
optogenetic studies only the change in lick rate is shown and analysed (see Figs 4, 
5 and Extended Data Figs 8 and 9).
Two-photon microscopy. Experimental design. Two-photon microscopy was 
used to visualize activity dynamics of PFC neurons in vivo. A virus encoding the  

calcium indicator GCaMP6s18 (AAVdj-CaMK2a -GCaMP6s; 5.3 ×  1012 infec-
tious units per ml) was injected into PFC (see Subjects and surgery). For imaging  
projection-specific neurons, a virus encoding the Cre-dependent calcium indi-
cator GCaMP6s (AAVdj-ef1α -DIO-GCaMP6s; 3.1 ×  1012 infectious units per ml; 
from Karl Deisseroth) was injected into PFC, and the retrogradely transported 
canine adenovirus encoding Cre-recombinase31,32 was injected into either NAc or 
PVT (Cav2-Cre; 4.2 ×  1012 infectious units per ml). After a minimum of 8 weeks 
to allow virus transport and infection, mice underwent Pavlovian conditioning, 
during which GCaMP6s-expressing neurons were visualized using two-photon 
microscopy.
Data acquisition, signal extraction, and analysis. A two-photon microscope 
(FVMPE-RS) was equipped with the following to allow imaging of PFC in vivo: a 
hybrid scanning core set with galvanometers and fast resonant scanners (allows 
up to 30 Hz frame-rate acquisition; set to 2.5 Hz), multi-alkali PMT and GaAsP-
PMT photo detectors with adjustable voltage, gain, and offset features, a single 
green/red NDD filter cube, a long working distance 20×  air objective designed 
for optical transmission at infrared wavelengths (Olympus, LCPLN20XIR,  
0.45 NA, 8.3 mm WD), a software-controlled modular xy stage loaded on a manual 
z-deck, and a tunable Mai-Tai Deep See laser system (Spectra Physics, laser set to 
955 nm, ~ 100 fs pulse width) with automated four-axis alignment. Before each 
conditioning session, a particular field of view (FOV) was selected by adjusting the 
imaging plane (z-axis), and each FOV was spaced at least 50 μ m from one another 
to prevent visualization of the same cells across multiple FOVs. During each con-
ditioning session, two-photon scanning was triggered for each trial 7 s before cue 
delivery, and a 20 s video was then collected for each trial. Data were both acquired 
and processed using a computer equipped with FluoView (Olympus, FV1200) and 
cellSens (Olympus) software packages. Following data acquisition, videos were 
motion corrected using a planar hidden Markov model (SIMA v1.3)33 and regions 
of interest (ROIs) were hand drawn around each cell using the standard deviation 
projection of the motion-corrected video using ImageJ. Next, calcium transient 
time series data were extracted with SIMA and analysed using custom Python 
data analysis pipelines written in the laboratory (by V.M.K.N.). For analysis,  
data were split into two groups (early and late) that were defined based on behav-
ioural performance and the day of conditioning (see Head-fixed behaviour). Next, 
each recorded neuron was defined as having an excitatory response, inhibitory 
response, or no response. Significant responses represent significant two-tailed 
auROC comparing average fluorescence (Δ f/f) of the trace interval (1 s after CS 
offset) versus baseline (1 s before CS onset) where P <  0.05 after Benjamini–
Hochberg false discovery rate correction. Each P value for auROC was defined 
by calculating the P values for the corresponding Mann–Whitney U statistic. χ2 
tests were then used to compare the number of CS+ responders to CS− respond-
ers for each group. For additional decoding analysis (for example, Fig. 2f, l), we 
tested whether the identity of the cue on any given trial could be decoded from 
the mean trace interval response on that trial using support vector machines. 
To this end, we used the Python module, scikitlearn, with GridSearchCV and a 
support vector classification (SVC) estimator with a radial basis function kernel, 
optimizing across the following parameters: γ : {10−2, 10−1, 100, 101, 102}, C: {10−2, 
10−1, 100, 101, 102}. Quantification of performance was done using tenfold valida-
tion34. For each neuron, the highest accuracy score across these parameters was 
used as the metric of accuracy. In order to determine whether the population of 
accuracy scores across all neurons was significantly different from that expected 
by chance, we performed a single shuffle per neuron by randomizing the cue 
identity on every trial. The population of shuffled accuracy scores across one 
shuffle was then compared to the population of unshuffled accuracy scores using 
a two-tailed Welch’s t-test. Note that since the metric of accuracy was optimized 
across parameters, the mean accuracy score expected by chance is not 0.5, but is 
instead closer to 0.55 (Fig. 2f, l and Extended Data Fig. 4d). We also further tested 
whether the mean activity during the trace interval on a given trial for one neuron 
could be used to decode the number of licks in the trace interval. This was per-
formed using support vector regression (SVR) in scikitlearn with GridSearchCV 
with a radial basis function kernel, optimizing across the following parameters: 
C: 5 logarithmically equidistant points between 10−3 and 103 {10−3, 3.16 ×  10−2, 
100, 3.16 ×  102, 103}, ε : 5 logarithmically equidistant points between 10−3 and 103 
{10−3, 3.16 ×  10−2, 100, 3.16 ×  102, 103}, γ : 10 logarithmically equidistant points 
between 10−6 and 106 {10−6, 2.15 ×  10−5, 4.64 ×  10−4, 10−2, 2.15 ×  10−1, 4.64, 
102, 2.15 ×  103, 4.64 ×  104, 106}. Quantification of performance was done using 
tenfold validation of the R2 metric (note that this metric can be infinitely negative, 
indicating arbitrarily poor performance, but is bounded on the positive end at 1, 
indicating perfect decoding). We found that as a population, the number of antic-
ipatory licks during the trace interval could not be decoded in the late sessions  
in CaMK2a-expressing neurons (mean R2 =  − 1.21), PFC–NAc neurons (mean  
R2 =  − 0.92) or PFC–PVT neurons (mean R2 =  − 0.39). These negative numbers

cell population.
Optogenetics. Behavioural optogenetics were performed as described in detail 
previously30. In brief, during surgery a virus encoding Cre-inducible channel-
rhodopsin-2 (AAV5-ef1α -DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP; 5.0 ×  1012 infectious 
units per ml), halorhodopsin (AAV5-ef1α -eNpHR3.0-eYFP; 8.0 ×  1012 infec-
tious units per ml), or control (AAV5-ef1α -eYFP; 6.0 ×  1012 infectious units 
per ml) was injected into PFC; and Cav2-Cre (refs 31, 32) (4.2 ×  1012 infectious 
units per ml) was injected into either NAc or PVT. After a minimum of 8 weeks 
to allow sufficient virus transport and infection, mice underwent Pavlovian 
conditioning.

For acquisition experiments (for example, Fig. 4), mice underwent eight daily 
conditioning sessions with laser followed by a test session (no laser). For photo-
activation manipulations in ChR2 or control mice, the laser (473 nm; 8–10 mW) 
was turned on for 5-ms pulses (20 Hz) during 80% of the cue trials, starting at 
the cue onset and ending at the reward delivery. For photoinhibition manipula-
tions in eNpHR3.0 or control mice, the laser (532 nm; 8–10 mW) did not pulse. 
Because the laser had no effect in the control mice, these data were collapsed 
across PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT groups. For expression experiments (for exam-
ple, Fig. 5), after mice reached high performance criterion (late, auROC >  0.66),  
they underwent six daily conditioning sessions. Furthermore, every other  
session was selected for optogenetic manipulations, during which the laser was 
presented for 3 s during either the cue and trace interval or at random time 
epochs outside of cue or reward delivery. Because there was no effect of laser in 
the ChR2 or eNpHR3.0 control mice, these data were collapsed for PFC–NAc 
groups and PFC–PVT groups. In addition, for expression experiments subsets 
of control mice were used twice, once as ChR2 controls (blue light), and again 
as eNpHR3.0 controls (green light). Following experiments, histological verifi-
cation of fluorescence and optical fibre placements were performed as described  
previously35.

Behavioural data (change in lick rate, see above) was analysed based on a priori 
comparisons of interest (effect of laser on ChR2/eNpHR3.0 animals versus effect 
of laser in eYFP animals). For acquisition experiments (Fig. 4; Extended Data  
Fig. 8a–f), we analysed data from the no-laser test day only, and specifically com-
pared the change in lick rate between the ChR2 or eNpHR3.0 groups versus the 
eYFP group. To correct for the double comparison (ChR2 or eNpHR3.0 versus 
eYFP), we performed a Benjamini–Hochberg multiple comparisons correction. 
For expression experiments (Fig. 5; Extended Data Figs 8 g–l and 9), in each pair 
of sessions (no laser, laser) we calculated the difference in mean lick rate between 
the two in order to obtain a statistical measure of the ‘effect of laser’ per session 
pair. Next, we compared the effects of laser from the ChR2 or eNpHR3.0 groups 
versus the corresponding effect of laser in the eYFP group. To correct for the double 
comparison (ChR2 or eNpHR3.0 versus eYFP), we again performed a Benjamini–
Hochberg multiple comparisons correction. Considering this, for optogenetic 
experiments all P values (which are two-tailed throughout the manuscript) have 
been corrected for multiple comparisons.
Retrograde tracing. The anatomy and electrophysiological properties of PFC–NAc 
and PFC–PVT neurons were evaluated through retrograde tracing36. Specifically, 
during surgeries the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B conjugated to Alexa 
Fluor (CtB-488, CtB-594; Molecular Probes) was injected bilaterally into NAc 
(500 nl per side) and on the midline in PVT (300 nl; colour counterbalanced across 
mice). Ten days following surgery, animals were killed for histology (n =  3 mice) 
or slice electrophysiology (n =  3 mice). For anatomical experiments, a student 
blind to all experiments (E.P.M.) and conditions counted the number of CtB-488 
positive, CtB-594 positive, and double-positive neurons in prelimbic medial pre-
frontal cortex (a subregion of dorsal medial PFC). The distance of each cell from 
the midline and the layer specificity of each cell were then measured using ImageJ. 
For electrophysiological experiments, mice were euthanized ten days following 
surgery for patch-clamp recordings ex vivo (see below for details).
Rabies tracing. The monosynaptic afferents to PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons  
were identified using a glycoprotein-deleted rabies strategy37 in combination with 
Cav2-Cre targeting of projection-specific neuron populations. Specifically, during 
the first surgery a cocktail containing the Cre-dependent starter viruses encod-
ing the G-protein and TVA were injected into PFC (3:1 of AAV5-FLEX-RG and 
AAV5-FLEX-TVA-mCherry; 300 nl per side), and Cav2-Cre was injected into 
either NAc (500 nl per side) or PVT (300 nl). Five weeks later, mice were given 
a second surgery in which the G-deleted rabies virus was injected into PFC (1:5 
diluted EnvA-rabies-GFP). Finally, 8 days after the rabies injection each mouse  
(n =  3 per group) was euthanized for histology and cell quantification. Our rabies 
protocol led to sparse labelling of PFC-projection neurons, allowing quantification 
of individual cells in each brain section (40 μ m thick). Each ROI was selected 
based on previous PFC tracing experiments38, as well as the fluorescence intensity 

observed in our experiments. Next, out of all tissue collected for each ROI in each 
mouse, we selected the three sections containing the most cells per region, and 
used confocal microscopy to get cellular-resolution images of all cells in each 
of those sections. For each section, we quantified all individual input neurons 
(GFP+) and starter cells (both GFP+ and mCherry+). Considering that the ante-
rior cingulate cortex (ACC) was close to the PFC injection site, some sections 
containing ACC also had starter cell labelling. Thus, because we were interested 
in long-range inputs from ACC only, only sections that did not have mCherry 
labelling were used for ACC input quantification. Finally, rabies-tracing data were 
analysed by comparing the number of cells in each section across groups (raw 
neuron count), and by comparing the percentage of input neurons per starter cell 
for each particular mouse.
Patch-clamp electrophysiology. Mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbital 
(50 mg kg−1) before transcardial perfusion with ice-cold sucrose cutting solu-
tion containing the following (in mM): 225 sucrose, 119 NaCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4,  
4.9 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 26.2 NaHCO3, 1.25 glucose, 305 mOsm. Brains were then 
rapidly removed, and coronal sections 300 μ m thick were made using a vibra-
tome (Leica, VT 1200). Sections were then incubated in aCSF (32 °C) containing 
the following (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 
26.2 NaHCO3, 15 glucose, approximately 306 mOsm. After an hour of recovery, 
slices were constantly perfused with aCSF (32 °C) and visualized using differential 
interference contrast through a 40×  water-immersion objective mounted on an 
upright microscope (Olympus BX51WI). Whole-cell recordings were obtained 
using borosilicate pipettes (3–5 M Ω ) back-filled with internal solution containing 
the following (in mM): 130 K gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 2 MgCl2,  
2 ATP, 0.2 GTP (pH 7.35, 270–285 mOsm).

Current-clamp recordings were obtained from GCaMP6s-expressing neurons 
to identify how action potential frequency correlated with GCaMP6s fluorescence. 
Specifically, to determine how elevations in action potential frequency influence 
GCaMP6s fluorescence, a 1 s train of depolarizing pulses (2 nA, 2 ms) was applied 
at a frequency of 1, 2, 5, 10 or 20 Hz. To determine how attenuations in action 
potential frequency influence GCaMP6s fluorescence, a 3 s pause was applied 
after a 10 s baseline train of depolarizing pulses (2 nA, 2 ms; 1, 2, 5, 10 or 20 Hz). 
Finally, to determine if hyperpolarization influences GCaMP6s fluorescence in 
the absence of action potential frequency modulation, a 3 s hyperpolarizing step 
(150 pA) was applied in neurons that were held either below or above resting 
membrane potential. During electrophysiological recordings, GCaMP6s fluores-
cence dynamics were visualized using a mercury lamp (Olympus, U-RFL-T) and 
microscope-mounted camera (QImaging, optiMOS). Imaging data were acquired 
using Micro-Manager, and extracted through hand-drawn ROIs for each recorded 
neuron using ImageJ.

Current-clamp recordings were also obtained to identify the intrinsic proper-
ties of PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT neurons in retrograde tracing experiments, as 
previously described39. First, action potential firing was examined by applying a 
series of long depolarizing sweeps (800 ms) at + 25 pA steps (0–450 pA). Next, 
rheobase (the minimum amount of current required for an action potential to 
fire) was measured by applying a series of short depolarizing sweeps (50 ms) at  
+ 10 pA steps (starting at 0 pA) until the recorded neuron fired an action potential. 
For all patch-clamp experiments, data acquisition occurred at 1 kHz sampling 
rate through a MultiClamp 700B amplifier connected to a Digidata 1440A dig-
itizer (Molecular Devices). Data were analysed using Clampfit 10.3 (Molecular 
Devices).
Data collection. The nature of all imaging and behavioural experiments yields 
high-power datasets, as we can test responses to reward-predictive cues hundreds 
of times within a single session. Thus, although the experiments themselves require 
rigorous experimentation, the number of mice that are required for each exper-
iment is generally 3–6 per group, depending on the effect size (which was not 
predetermined for these experiments). Mice were randomly picked for each group 
in each experiment, by alternating the surgery for each mouse in a cage. During 
data collection, investigators were only blind to the conditions for rabies tracing 
cell counting and CtB cell counting. The only mice excluded from final analysis 
were those that died before or during the experiments (n =  3). For optogenetic 
experiments, mice were excluded if histology confirmed ectopic virus expression 
outside of PFC (n =  1), or if optical-fibre placements were not in dorsomedial 
PFC (n =  0). For data analysis, equal variance was not assumed for behavioural 
optogenetics or imaging datasets. Equal variance was assumed for cell counting 
experiments and electrophysiological experiments.
Code and data availability. We used Python (codes written by V.M.K.N.) to analyse  
imaging and optogenetic datasets included in this manuscript (see Figs 1–5). That 
data, as well as the codes used for analysis, are openly available online (https://
github.com/stuberlab). All other data are available upon request from the corre-
sponding author.

(blue). Black refers to overlap (medial–lateral axis) between red and blue 
bars, and purple refers to double-labelled neurons (that is, both NAc- and 
PVT-projection neurons). i, Current-clamp recordings from dorsomedial 
PFC CtB-labelled neurons projecting to either NAc (top; n =  9 neurons; 
n =  3 mice; scale bars =  25 μ m) or PVT (bottom; n =  10 neurons; n =  3 

mice; scale bars =  25 μ m). j, k, Representative waveforms (j) and averaged 
data (k) showing that PFC–NAc neurons fired fewer action potentials 
(spikes) as compared to PFC–PVT neurons during somatic depolarization 
(interaction: F16,272 =  16.6, * * * P <  0.001). l, m, Representative waveforms (l) 
and averaged data (m) revealing no differences in rheobase (the minimum 
current required to evoke an action potential) between PFC–NAc and 
PFC–PVT neurons (t17 =  1.22, P >  0.2 (n.s., not significant)).  
n, o, Representative waveforms (n) and averaged data (o) showing that 
PFC–NAc neurons had larger peak afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) 
as compared to PFC–PVT neurons (t17 =  4.67, * * * P <  0.001). p, The 
maximum number of action potentials (spikes) in each neuron was 
correlated with the peak afterhyperpolarization (r =  0.80, P <  0.0001).

neurons have distinct monosynaptic inputs. a–d, Viral strategy for rabies  
tracing experiments in which the monosynaptic inputs to PFC–PVT (a, b)  
and PFC–NAc (c, d) neurons were evaluated (n =  3 mice per group).  
e–g, Example images showing mCherry+ cells (TVA expression) (e), 
RV-GFP+ (rabies virus encoding GFP) cells (f), and overlap revealing 
mCherry+/RV-GFP+ cells (starter cells; mCherry−/RV-GFP+ cells 
are considered local inputs) (g). h, The number of local input neurons 
(nonstarter; only RV-GFP+ cells per section) to each projection 
population, as quantified by raw neuron count and by the per cent of 
starter cells for each mouse, was equivalent for PFC–NAc and PFC–
PVT neurons (raw neuron count: t16 =  0.59, P =  0.56; per cent starter 
cells: t16 =  0.13, P =  0.90). i, Representative image showing RV-GFP 
but not mCherry expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). 
j, The number of input neurons from ACC was higher for PFC–PVT 
neurons as compared to PFC–NAc neurons (raw neuron count: 

t16 =  3.51; **P =  0.003; per cent starter cells: t16 =  3.31, ** P =  0.004). 
k, Representative image showing RV-GFP but not mCherry expression 
in the lateral pre-optic area (LPO). l, The number of input neurons from 
the LPO was equivalent for PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT cells (raw neuron 
count: t16 =  1.77; P =  0.10; per cent starter cells: t16 =  0.20, P =  0.84). 
m, Representative image showing RV-GFP but not mCherry expression in 
the ventral hippocampus (vHipp). n, The number of input neurons from 
the ventral hippocampus was higher for PFC–NAc neurons as compared 
with PFC–PVT neurons (raw neuron count: t16 =  4.44; * * * P <  0.001; per 
cent starter cells: t16 =  4.00, * * P =  0.001). o, Representative image showing 
RV-GFP but not mCherry expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). 
p, The number of input neurons from the VTA was equivalent for PFC–
NAc and PFC–PVT cells (raw neuron count: t16 =  0.56; P =  0.59; per cent 
starter cells: t16 =  0.09, P =  0.93). Bar graphs represent the mean ±  s.e.m. 
Note that no RV-GFP+ neurons were detected in any nucleus of the 
amygdala for either projection group.

projection neurons express CaMK2a and have distinct basal activity 
dynamics. a–d, Injections of AAV5-CaMK2a-eYFP into dorsomedial 
PFC and the retrograde tracer CtB-594 into NAc (a) or PVT (c) resulted 
in expression of eYFP in CtB-labelled PFC–NAc neurons (b) and PFC–
PVT neurons (d). These data reveal that PFC–NAc and PFC–PVT are 
subpopulations of CaMK2a-expressing neurons (n =  2 mice per group).  
e, f, In ai9 reporter mice, (e) AAVdj-DIO-GCaMP6s injections in 
dorsomedial PFC and Cav2-Cre injections into PVT (f) result in 
expression of GCaMP6s and tdTomato (marker for Cre-recombinase), 
which have spatial overlap in PFC (n =  2 mice). These data reveal that 

GCaMP6s expression is specific to the projection cells of interest. 
g, Example traces revealing spontaneous calcium dynamics from in vivo 
two-photon imaging in GCaMP6s-expressing PFC–NAc neurons (top; 
n =  69 neurons; n =  4 mice) and PFC–PVT neurons (bottom; n =  63; 
n =  3 mice) in awake, head-fixed mice. Red and blue dots refer to detected 
events. h–j, Averaged data reveal no differences in event amplitude (h) or 
event duration (i); however, PFC–NAc neurons had significantly shorter 
inter-event intervals (j) as compared to PFC–PVT neurons (amplitude: 
t130 =  1.10, P >  0.2; duration: t130 =  0.68, P >  0.4; interval: t130 =  2.30,  
* P <  0.05). Bar graphs represent the mean ±  s.e.m.

and corticothalamic neurons are not appetitive, aversive, and do 
not affect movement. Mice underwent a freely moving real-time place 
preference assay for 20 minutes to assess the rewarding or aversive value 
of PFC–NAc or PFC–PVT stimulation or inhibition (laser and group 
parameters are identical to head-fixed optogenetics experiments; see 
Methods). a, Tracking data from single example mice showing that PFC–
NAc::ChR2 (left; n = 5) and PFC–NAc::eNpHR3.0 (right; n =  5) mice spent 
equivalent time in chambers that were paired with laser (PFC–NAc::eYFP 
mice, n =  8). b, Grouped data show that laser stimulation in PFC–NAc 
mice did not lead to a real-time place preference (interaction: F2,30 =  2.15, 
P >  0.13). c, Grouped data show that optogenetic manipulations in 
PFC–NAc mice did not influence velocity of movement (interaction: 

F2,30 =  0.12, P >  0.88). d, Tracking data from single example mice during 
real-time place preference experiments showing that PFC–PVT::ChR2 
(left; n =  5) and PFC–PVT::eNpHR3.0 (right; n =  5) mice spent equivalent 
time in chambers that were paired with laser (PFC–PVT::eYFP mice,

not lead to a real-time place preference (interaction: F2,24 =  0.15, P >  0.86). 
f, Grouped data show that optogenetic stimulation in PFC–PVT did not 
influence velocity of movement (interaction: F2,24 =  0.10, P >  0.90).
