the interaction of neurofibromin and valosin-
containing protein/p97 in regulation of dendritic
spine formation

Abstract
Both Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) and inclusion body myopathy with Paget’s disease of bone and
frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) are autosomal dominant genetic disorders. These two diseases are fully
penetrant but with high heterogeneity in phenotypes, suggesting the involvement of genetic modifiers in
modulating patients’ phenotypes. Although NF1 is recognized as a developmental disorder and IBMPFD is
associated with degeneration of multiple tissues, a recent study discovered the direct protein interaction between
neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene, and VCP/p97, encoded by the causative gene of IBMPFD.
Both NF1 and VCP/p97 are critical for dendritic spine formation, which provides the cellular mechanism explaining
the cognitive deficits and dementia found in patients. Moreover, disruption of the interaction between
neurofibromin and VCP impairs dendritic spinogenesis. Neurofibromin likely influences multiple downstream
pathways to control dendritic spinogenesis. One is to activate the protein kinase A pathway to initiate dendritic
spine formation; another is to regulate the synaptic distribution of VCP and control the activity of VCP in dendritic
spinogenesis. Since neurofibromin and VCP/p97 also regulate cell growth and bone metabolism, the
understanding of neurofibromin and VCP/p97 in neurons may be applied to study of cancer and bone. Statin
treatment rescues the spine defects caused by VCP deficiency, suggesting the potential role of statin in clinical
treatment for these two diseases.

Review
Neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegeneration
Neurons are highly differentiated cells composed of several
specialized subcellular structures,
including soma,
dendrites, axon, and numerous synapses. All of these
structures play specific roles in signal transduction
between or within neurons. Besides dendrites and axons,
dendritic spines are particularly interesting structures,
which are the tiny protrusions (~0.5-1 μm in width and
~1-2 μm in length) extending from dendrites. The major-
ity of excitatory synapses in the mammalian nervous
system are localized at the tips of dendritic spines [1].

Morphology and density of dendritic spines are controlled
by genetic program, neuronal activity, and environmental
insults. Indeed, defects of neural development leading to
alterations of neuronal morphology are associated with
many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, includ-
ing mental retardation, learning disability, autism, atten-
tion-deficient hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia
[2,3]. On the other hand, impairment in maintenance of
neuronal morphology is also frequently found in neurode-
generative disorders. For instance, synaptic loss has been
suggested as a cause of dementia [4-6]. This review will
focus on an example showing that neurodegeneration may
be relevant with neurodevelopment in terms of regulation
of neuronal morphology. It is regarding a recent finding of

the interaction between neurofibromin and valosin-con-
taining protein (VCP).

Neurofibromin, the protein product of the neurofibro-
matosis type I (NF1) gene, regulates the formation of
dendritic spines [7], which explains at least partially why
patients with NF1 suffer from cognitive defects. Recently,
we further identified that VCP/p97 interacts with neuro-
fibromin and demonstrated that VCP/p97 also controls
dendritic spinogenesis of neurons [8]. Mutations in the
VCP gene result in inclusion body myopathy with Paget’s
disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD)
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The function of
VCP in spinogenesis provides a potential explanation
how VCP mutations result in dementia in patients.
Although both neurofibromin and VCP/p97 are ubiqui-
tously expressed in many tissues and are also involved in
tumorigenesis [9-11] and bone metabolism [12,13], the
current review focuses on the molecular functions of
neurofibromin and VCP/p97 in neurons.

peripheral nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas and
schwannomas). In addition, many other features are fre-
quently found in patients with NF1, including neurobe-
havioral developmental disorders as well as skeletal
lesions and malformations. Children with NF1 are fre-
quently associated with learning difficulty [14-16] and are
more susceptible to autism and attention-deficient hyper-
activity disorder [15-18]. Additionally, scoliosis, kyphosis,
short stature, and tibial bowing are common skeleton
manifestations occurring in NF1 patients [19]. Based on
the symptoms identified in patients with NF1, it is clear
that the NF1 gene plays important roles in cell growth
(tumor formation), pigmentation, neuronal activity and
function, and bone metabolism. Although NF1 is fully
penetrant, the phenotypes of NF1 patients are extremely
variable, even among patients in the same family. It is
unclear why clinical features of NF1 patients vary so
markedly. Genetic modifiers have been suggested to
influence the impact of NF1 deficits [20,21].

Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1)
Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1, MIM:162200) is one of
the most common autosomal dominant disorders affect-
ing about one in 3,500 individuals. NF1 is characterized
by skin pigmentations (café-au-lait spots and freckling),
Lisch nodules in the iris, and formations of benign

The function of neurofibromin in signaling
The NF1 gene encodes a large protein of 2818 amino acid
residues, named neurofibromin (Figure 1), with a well-
known RasGAP-related domain (GRD, ~350 amino acid
residues) at the central region of the protein [22]. The
RasGAP activity is believed to account for the tumor

suppression activity of neurofibromin [23-27], which is the
most well known function of neurofibromin. In addition
to downregulating the Ras pathway, neurofibromin
increases adenylyl cyclase activity and thus upregulates the
cAMP pathway through both Gas-dependent and Gas-
independent pathways [28,29]. More details about the role
of neurofibromin in signaling are available in the previous
review [30].

The obstacles of NF1 study
The NF1 gene was identified more than 20 years ago.
However, several obstacles impede the progress of NF1
study. First of all, perhaps due to cytotoxic effects, it is not
easy to express full length neurofibromin in the cell.
Therefore it is difficult to perform genetic manipulation to
study the molecular function of neurofibromin. Secondly,
mutational hot spots are not present in the NF1 gene. The
mutations identified from patients are dispersed through-
out the entire NF1 gene. It is therefore difficult to figure
out the pathogenic mechanism of NF1. Finally, with the
exception of the GRD, neurofibromin lacks a recognizable
enzymatic protein domain. Therefore, numerous efforts
have been directed to identify neurofibromin-interacting
proteins (Figure 1) [7,8,28,31-41]. Identification and char-
acterization of proteins that interact with neurofibromin
provide a better understanding of the molecular functions
of neurofibromin.

Neurofibromin regulates neuronal morphogenesis
The fact that patients with NF1 are frequently associated
with multiple neurobehavioral developmental disorders
suggests an important role of neurofibromin in brain
development and function. Indeed, several studies have
revealed the role of neurofibromin in neural develop-
ment. Through its C-terminal domain, neurofibromin
interacts with collapsing response mediator proteins,
CRMP-2 and CRMP-4 [35,39]. This interaction regulates
neurite outgrowth of neurons [39]. In addition to neur-
ite outgrowth, our previous study showed that neurofi-
bromin acts downstream of syndecan-2, a synaptic
heparan sulfate proteoglycan, in the regulation of den-
dritic spine formation [7]. Neurofibromin interacts with
syndecan-2 [34] and then activates the PKA-Ena/VASP
pathway through the cAMP pathway to promote actin
polymerization and bundle formation [7], thus promot-
ing the formation of dendritic filopodia, the precursors
of dendritic spines. The role of neurofibromin in dendri-
tic spinogenesis explains at least partially why patients
with NF1 are often associated with cognitive abnormal-
ities. Moreover, although the PKA pathway is essential
for dendritic filopodia and spine formation, activation of
PKA alone is not sufficient for the process [7], possibly
due to the involvement of multiple downstream path-
ways of neurofibromin in spinogenesis. Indeed, from a

series of proteomic and biochemical studies, we identi-
fied that neurofibromin uses its leucine-rich domain
(LRD) to directly interact with the valosin-containing
protein (VCP) [8]. Knockdown of endogenous VCP
reduces the density of dendritic spines, but does not
noticeably influence their width or length. Interruption
of the interaction between neurofibromin and VCP also
reduces the spine density [8]. The studies suggest that
neurofibromin regulates dendritic spine formation
through at least two pathways: one cAMP-dependent
and the other VCP-dependent.

Valosin-containing protein (VCP) and degeneration
disorders
IBMPFD MIM:167320, [42] is a dominant inherited dis-
order with three major symptoms: myopathy, osteolytic
bone lesion, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Simi-
lar to NF1, IBMPFD is also fully penetrant, but expres-
sivity is variable, suggesting the involvement of genetic
modifiers in the influence of phenotype [43,44]. Around
80-90% and 50% of patients develop inclusion body
myopathy and osteolytic lesions, respectively, with a
mean age of 42 years. Only about 30-35% of patients
had early-onset FTD typically presenting at age 53 years
[42-44]. In addition to IBMPFD, recent human genetic
analysis indicated that VCP mutations account for 1-2%
of autosomal dominantly inherited amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) [45]. VCP interacts with the polygluta-
mine-containing aggregates that are found in patients
with Huntington’s and Machado-Joseph diseases [46].
VCP also associates with ubiquitinated protein aggre-
gates and is involved in TDP-43-related frontotemporal
dementia [47-49].

Molecular functions of VCP
VCP, a multifunctional AAA (ATPases Associated with
a variety of cellular Activities) protein, forms a homo-
hexameric barrel and hydrolyses ATP to generate the
mechanical force for its function as a molecular cha-
peron [50-52]. It possesses two ATPase domains (D1
and D2). The D2 domain carries the major ATPase
activity, while the D1 domain is also the hexamerization
domain of VCP. The N-terminal region (N-domain) of
VCP is involved in its interaction with various adaptors.
The identified IBMPFD mutations are highly clustered
in the N- and D1 domains of VCP [42,53-55]. There-
fore, IBMPFD mutations can change the conformation
of the catalytic domains, alter the ATPase activity, and
compromise the function of VCP [56]. Through the N-
terminus interacting adaptors, VCP regulates a variety
of cellular events, including cell-cycle control, mem-
brane fusion, ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation,
endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation
(ERAD), and autophagy [51,57-64].

So far, it is not clear how mutations in the VCP gene
lead to IBMPFD or other degeneration diseases. An
IBMPFD-associated VCP mutant was shown to induce
aggregation of polyubiquitin-conjugated proteins in
myoblastoma cells [65]. TDP-43-positive aggregates are
also found in the muscles of patients with IBMPFD [48].
VCP mutations have also been shown to cause autop-
hagy dysfunction, which may additionally contribute to
the pathogenesis of IBMPFD [62,63,66]. Therefore, dys-
regulation of protein degradation has been proposed to
play a role in IBMPFD and VCP-related disorders.

Although the formation of VCP-positive protein aggre-
gates induced by IBMPFD mutation have been demon-
strated in muscle, the significance of protein aggregation
in neurons is not so clear. Expression of IBMPFD mutant
VCP in cultured neurons reduces the density of dendritic
spines, but does not induce VCP aggregation [8]. It sug-
gests that VCP aggregation is not the cause of synaptic
defects induced by IBMPFD mutations. However, it does
not suggest the irrelevance of dysregulation of protein
degradation in IBMPFD. Perhaps after expression for six
days in cultured neurons, protein degradation (through
either proteasomal degradation or autophagy) is impaired
and thus spine density is reduced, although the unde-
graded proteins have not yet formed aggregates. The
involvement of ERAD, proteasomal degradation, and/or
autophagy in VCP-dependent dendritic spine formation
should be investigated directly in the future.

The previous studies had demonstrated that VCP
forms complexes with cofactor p47 and regulates multi-
ple membrane fusion events in cells [67,68], including
nuclear envelope assembly [69], ER/Golgi membrane
assembly [70,71], ER morphogenesis [72,73], and mem-
brane fusion of autophagy [74]. Because p47 also coexists
with VCP in the immunoprecipitated complex containing
neurofibromin [8], it is likely that membrane fusion
mediated by VCP also contributes to dendritic spine for-
mation. More investigations have to been performed to
address the possible role of VCP-mediated membrane
fusion in dendritic spine formation.

VCP and neuronal morphogenesis
Although the molecular mechanism underlying IBMPFD
pathogenesis is still unclear, the accumulated evidence
indicates that VCP plays critical roles in neuronal mor-
phogenesis, which may account for the dementia pheno-
type associated with IBMPFD patients. Firstly, dystrophic
neurites are frequently found in patients with FTD
[55,75,76]. Moreover, VCP also regulates remodeling of
dendritic arbor in Drosophila [77]. We also found that
VCP is critical for the density of dendritic spines in cul-
tured neurons. Expression of IBMPFD mutant VCP
reduces the density of dendritic spines in cultured rat

hippocampal neurons [8]. It is very possible that VCP
actively contributes to neuronal morphogenesis and thus
dysfunction of VCP may result in neurodegeneration.

The interaction between neurofibromin and VCP
Using a variety of proteomic and biochemical methods, we
identified a direct interaction between neurofibromin and
VCP. The LRD of neurofibromin and the D1D2 region of
VCP are required for the interaction [8]. We further
showed that VCP acts downstream of neurofibromin in
modulating dendritic spine formation. Compared with
wild-type (WT) neurons, Nf1+/- neurons have a lower den-
sity of dendritic spines [8]. Overexpression of WT VCP,
but not the IBMPFD mutant, rescues the defects of spine
density caused by Nf1 haploinsufficiency [8]. Moreover,
the synaptic distribution of VCP is reduced in Nf1+/-
brains [8]. These results suggest that neurofibromin tar-
gets VCP to synapses and directs the function of VCP in
spinogenesis.

To further elucidate the role of the neurofibromin-VCP
interaction in NF1 and IBMPFD, the influence of muta-
tions in the genes identified in patients has been investi-
gated. The neurofibromin mutant (Y1587delta) lacking the
Y1587 residue in the LRD has a much weaker interaction
with VCP [8]. Patient carrying the Y1587delta mutation
presents clinically with short stature and dementia [8],
which echo the functions of VCP in dementia and bone
metabolism. Moreover, unlike full length WT neurofibro-
min, expression of full length Y1587delta mutant does not
rescue spine deficiency caused by Nf1 haploinsufficiency
[8]. On the other hand, the VCP R155H and R95G muta-
tions, the most common mutations in VCP, also reduce
the interaction between VCP and neurofibromin [8]. In
contrast to WT VCP, expression of these VCP mutants do
not rescue the dendritic spine defects in Nf1+/- neurons
[8]. Taken together, these data show that reduction of the
interaction between neurofibromin and VCP occurs in
both NF1 and IBMPFD patients.

Genetic modifications of NF1 and IBMPFD
Since the phenotypes of both NF1 and IBMPFD vary
markedly, genetic modifications have been suggested to
influence the function of neurofibromin and VCP. The
interacting proteins of neurofibromin and VCP are possi-
ble genetic modifier candidates. Indeed, VCP interacts
with different cofactors and regulates various cellular
processes [43,59,64]. The variant expression levels of
cofactors or other interacting proteins of VCP are likely
to influence the functions of VCP. In addition to Ras and
VCP, neurofibromin has been shown to also interact with
syndecans [30,34], 14-3-3 [38], CRMP2/4 [35,39], and
APP [37] (Figure 1). Our recent study indicated that
overexpression of VCP rescues the defects of dendritic

spines in cultured Nf1+/- cortical neurons [8]. This sug-
gests that variation of VCP protein levels affects the phe-
notypes caused by Nf1 haploinsufficiency. It is important
to further explore this possibility in NF1 patients. Exami-
nation of the VCP expression levels and their correlation
with the phenotypes of NF1 patients will provide clues
whether the VCP expression levels influence the pheno-
types of patients with NF1.

The potential clinical effect of statin
Statin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-
coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, has been shown to
rescue the learning and attention deficits of Nf1 mutant
mice [78]. HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting
enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, which produces cho-
lesterol and other isoprenoids. The role of statin in NF1
was examined because of the essential role of lipid modifi-
cation in Ras activity, which is upregulated in NF1 mutant
cells [79,80]. Additionally, cholesterol is involved in regula-
tion of dendritic spinogenesis [81]. Thus, control of lipid
metabolism may be critical for cognitive function. Recent
studies indicated that VCP is required for downregulation
of the protein levels of HMG-CoA reductase [82-84].
HMG-CoA reductase expression is tightly controlled by
the concentration of sterol in cells, which influences both
gene expression and protein stability of HMG-CoA reduc-
tase. VCP plays an essential role in sterol-induced disloca-
tion of HMG-CoA reductase from the ER, which leads to
ubiquitination and degradation of HMG-CoA reductase
[82-84]. Thus, statin may correct the defects of Nf1 hap-
loinsufficiency in both Ras- and VCP-dependent pathways.
It also implies that statin may be applied to NF1 patients
who have defects in the interaction between neurofibro-
min and VCP.

Conclusions
The heterogeneity of patients’ phenotypes presents an
obstacle to establishing effective and specific clinical treat-
ments for NF1 and IBMPFD. Understanding the molecu-
lar mechanisms of the pathogenesis of NF1 and IBMPFD,
which still need more investigation to elucidate the finer
details, is essential for overcoming these obstacles. Identifi-
cation of the interacting molecules and elucidation of the
crosstalk between or among the interacting proteins are
certainly important to understanding the pathogenic
mechanisms. The connection of the interaction between
neurofibromin and VCP and the regulation of dendritic
spinogenesis has provided the first molecular evidence
that VCP functions as a genetic modifier for NF1. Studies
in mouse genetic models and patients now have to be per-
formed to confirm the role of VCP as a downstream effec-
tor of neurofibromin. It will also be interesting to explore
whether mutations in the NF1 gene modulate the pheno-
types of IBMPFD.
