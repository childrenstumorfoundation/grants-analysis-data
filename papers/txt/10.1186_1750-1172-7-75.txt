Abstract

Background: To examine the natural growth dynamics of internal plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) in patients with
neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1).
Methods: Two hundred and one NF1 patients underwent whole body MRI (WBMRI). Tumour burden was
estimated volumetrically. Non-parametric Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients were used to analyse the
relationship of growth rate to tumour volume and age. Chi-squared and Mann–Whitney U tests were used for
analysing the association of tumour occurrence with sex or age. Chi-squared tests were used to analyse the
association of tumour growth with age group.
Results: Seventy-one of 171 patients with serial WBMRI exams had internal PNs (median follow up 2.2 years
[1.1 to 4.9 years]). Median whole body tumour volume was 86.4 mL [5.2 to 5878.5 mL]) with a median growth rate
of 3.7%/year (−13.4 to 111%/year) that correlated with larger whole body tumour volume (P<0.001) and lower age
(P=0.004). No new PNs developed in 273.0 patient-years among patients without tumours. Rate of new tumour
development among patients with PNs was 0.6%/year (95% confidence interval 0.02 to 3.4%). Twenty-seven (13.5%)
tumours increased significantly and were more frequent among children (P<0.001). Growth rate of tumours was
inversely correlated with age (Spearman’s rho=−0.330, P<0.001). Seventy-one (35.5%) tumours had smaller volumes
on follow up (median −3.4%/year [−0.07% to −35.9%/year]).
Conclusion: Children with NF1 and internal PNs are at risk for tumour growth. Most PNs grow slowly or not at all,
and some decrease in size. New tumours are infrequent in NF1 patients with PNs and unlikely in patients without
PNs.

Background
Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) develop frequently in
individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). Physical
examination can detect superficial PNs in about 27% of
NF1 patients but internal PNs can only be detected by
imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) [1,2]. Our cross-sectional study with whole body
MRI demonstrated internal PNs in 50% of NF1 patients

[3]. Recent studies revealed that 55% of PNs in child-
hood are symptomatic [4]. About 17% of superficial PNs,
38% of displacing PNs, and 64% of invasive PNs cause
functional impairment [5]. PNs may also transform into
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs),
which occur in about 10% of NF1 patients [6]. Higher
internal tumour burden appears to be a risk factor for
the development of MPNST, and rapid increase in size,
the development of severe pain, or new neurological defi-
cits may indicate malignant transformation of an existing
PN [3,6].

Growth of PNs varies greatly among patients but its
course over time has not been well delineated [7,8].

Characterizing the natural history of PN growth is essen-
tial for patient management as well as for designing clin-
ical trials. Better understanding of the growth dynamics
of PNs may also help identify patterns that are indicative
of malignant transformation.

Results of two recent studies suggest that the growth of
PNs is inversely correlated with age, at least in younger
NF1 patients [7,8]. However, one of these two studies
assessed PN growth using two-dimensional measure-
ments [7], that are relatively insensitive to changes in
tumour size [9]. The other study used three-dimensional
volumetric analyses but included only selected tumours
in a small number of children and adolescents, who were
enrolled for drug trials [8]. In the present study, we
assessed internal PNs by volumetric whole body MRI in
171 unselected NF1 patients of various ages and followed
tumour growth over a median period of 2.2 years.

Methods
Patients
This is a retrospective cohort study. A total of 201 NF1
patients diagnosed according to the National Institutes of
Health Diagnostic Criteria National Institutes of Health
[10], who underwent whole body MRI between 2003 and
2008 were enrolled in this study. We did not exclude
patients, who had prior surgery, but MRI examinations
on participants, who underwent surgery during the
period of study were excluded. The Ethical Committee of
the Medical Chamber in Hamburg approved the investi-
gation. All patients gave informed consent to participate.
Whole body axial short tau inversion recovery (STIR)
MRI studies were acquired using a 1.5 Tesla Siemens
Magnetom 63 SP/Symphony/Avanto scanner.
Images
were obtained from the top of the head to mid-calf in a
series of ten mm slices without skips.

PNs were diagnosed on the basis of their characteristic
appearance as signal
intense masses on T2-weighted
STIR MRI sequences [11]. PNs smaller than 3.0 cm in
greatest diameter were excluded because their volume
could not be assessed accurately on the whole body MRI
images.

Volumetric MRI analysis
Analysis of tumour volume was performed using MedX
software (v3.42), a heuristics-based semi-automated
method for segmentation and measurement [9]. Differ-
ence of signal intensity in healthy (low intensity) and
tumour (high intensity) tissue was utilized to define
tumour margins on each axial slice and thereafter to per-
form an automated volume calculation. This volumetric
assessment is sensitive and reproducible, yielding results
similar to those of manual tracings [9]. If automated
border tracing was not possible for a particular tumour,
manual tracing was performed.

Statistical analyses
Because of the irregular distribution of age, tumour num-
ber, tumour size, and tumour growth rate, non-parametric
Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients were used to ana-
lyse the relationship of growth rate to tumour volume and
age. Chi-squared and Mann–Whitney U tests were used
for analysing the association of tumour occurrence (pres-
ence or absence on whole body MRI) with sex or age, re-
spectively. We defined an increase in tumour volume that
exceeded 20% per year compared to the previous volume
as significant tumour growth in accordance with previous
studies using this method [9]. Children were defined as
individuals below 18 years of age, and adults as those 18
of age and older. Chi-squared tests were used to analyse
the association of tumour growth to age group. All calcu-
lations were performed with SPSS Predictive Analytics
Software version 18.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New
York, USA). p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Results
Analysis of whole body tumour burden
Two hundred one NF1 patients (113 females and 88
males) were enrolled in this study. The median age at
the time of initial MRI was 28.6 years (range 1.7-63.4
years). A total of 100 (49.8%) of the 201 patients studied
at the initial whole-body MRI had one or more internal
PN, while the other 101 patients (50.2%) did not have
any measurable internal tumours. There was no signifi-
cant association between the presence of tumours and
age, but a weak correlation was seen with male sex
(Spearman’s rho=0.145, P=0.041).

Thirty patients, who received a baseline MRI could
not be included in the whole body longitudinal analysis
because they did not return for follow-up examination,
they had surgery on one or more tumours after their ini-
tial MRI, or imaging quality on follow-up MRI was not
adequate for volumetric analysis of all tumours mea-
sured on the first examination. Of the 171 patients, who
had serial whole body MRI scans analysed, 140 patients
(81.9%) had two MRI examinations, 29 patients (17.0%)
had three scans, and two patients (1.2%) had four scans.
Altogether, a total of 375 whole body MRI scans on
these 171 patients were analyzed. The median duration
of follow up was 2.2 years, ranging from 1.1 to 4.9 years.
Seventy-one of the 171 NF1 patients, who had serial
whole body MRI examinations had internal PNs. In these
71 patients, the median total body volume of tumours
was 86.4 mL (range, 5.2-5878.5 mL) on initial exam. The
median rate of growth in whole body tumour burden
expressed as a percentage of the total volume of tumours
measured in the patient on first exam was 3.7% per year,
with a range of −13.4% to 111.1% per year. Figure 1
shows the change in whole body tumour volume by age

with NF1. Patient 1890, who developed MPNST during the course

in each of the patients with internal PNs, who underwent
serial whole body MRI (cf. Additional file 1).

In these 71 patients, the whole body tumour volume
at the time of the initial MRI scan correlated with the
absolute rate of growth of the whole body tumour bur-
den (expressed as mL/year) (Spearman’s rho = 0.499,
P<0.001). Age at first exam correlated inversely with
whole body tumour growth rate expressed as a percent-
age of the initial total tumour volume (Spearman’s rho =
−0.340, P=0.004).

No new PNs (95% Poisson exact confidence interval,
0.0 to 3.69 per year) developed in 273.0 patient-years of
observation among the 100 patients, who had no detecf
tumours on initial MRI. The risk of new internal PN de-
velopment among these patients is likely to be <1.4% per
year. Among the 71 patients with tumours on initial
MRI, who were followed with serial examinations, one
(95% Poisson exact confidence interval, 0.03-5.57) new
tumour arose in 165.5 patient-years of observation
(Figure 2). The risk of new tumour development among
patients with one or more PNs on initial whole body
MRI was 0.6% (95% confidence interval, 0.02-3.4%) per
year.

Analysis of growth of individual tumours
Volumetric MRI measurements on at least two occa-
sions were available on a total of 201 different tumours
in 95 NF1 patients, who had one or more tumours iden-
tified on the first examination. Sixty-six tumours were
identified among 32 patients, who were younger than 18
years of age at first exam. A total of 135 PNs were found
in 63 adults (age 18 years or older).

Figure 2 Development of a new PN on MRI; the only PN that
arose during the period of observation in this study is shown
in this figure (Patient 1670, Tumour 5). A: cross-sectional image
through the thigh at age 46 years; B: cross-sectional image through
the thigh at age 48 years.

The median volume of these 201 tumours on the first
valid MRI exam was 44.3 mL, with a range of 0–5810.4
mL. One tumour was not seen on the subject’s first MRI
but was apparent and measurable on the follow-up exam
(Patient 1670, tumour 5); this tumour was excluded
from the analyses of tumour growth. Figure 3 shows the
change in volume of the 201 individual tumours by age
in 95 NF1 patients, who underwent serial whole body
MRI (cf. Additional file 2).

The median rate of growth of the individual tumours
expressed as a percentage of the volume measured on
the first exam was 2.8% per year, with a range of −35.9%
to 3667% per year. The rate of growth of individual
tumours was inversely correlated with age at
initial
examination (Spearman’s rho = −0.330, P<0.001) but not
with the volume of tumour on initial MRI exam.

Twenty-seven (13.5%) of the 200 individual tumours
that were followed longitudinally by MRI in this study
increased in size more than 20% per year, on average.
Among these 27 PNs, 19 were present
in patients
younger than 18 years of age, corresponding to 29% of
the 66 tumours found in this group of patients. Eight
(6.0%) of 134 tumours among patients older than 18
years grew more than 20% per year. Tumours that grew
more than 20% per year were significantly more frequent
among children than among adults (P<0.001).

One of the 19 PNs in children under 18 that increased
in size more than 20% per year during the period of

preferentially referred to our centre. Patients were asked
consecutively to participate in the study between 2003 and
2008 regardless of gender, age, or clinical presentation, but
only a fraction of these patients agreed to undergo WBMRI
exam and gave written informed consent. The main rea-
sons for patients or guardians to refuse participation were
logistical problems, claustrophobia, the need for moderate
sedation in children, and expected discomfort. It is possible
that patients with a more severe course or, who were more
concerned about the possibility of internal tumours were
more likely to volunteer for the study.

Our results clearly show that the growth rate of PNs
in NF1 patients is correlated with whole body total
tumour volume and inversely correlated with age. The
greater rate of growth in young children is consistent
with clinical observations and with the results of two
previous studies in NF1 patients [7,8]. Individuals with
high whole body tumour volumes and young patients
deserve close monitoring by clinical examination and
whole body MRI. Because their tumours are more likely
to grow, early surgical intervention may be considered
[12]. Older patients and those with no internal tumours
on initial MRI are less likely to develop neurological or
other complications that are associated with large in-
ternal tumours or tumour growth. Further investigations
are needed to see if more frequent monitoring of high-
risk patients and less frequent monitoring of low-risk
patients would improve care and over-all survival
in
NF1 patients.

Some of the patients included in our study had under-
gone surgery for removal or reduction of tumours in the
past. Surgical reduction of tumours may have an influ-
ence on their growth [13]; this needs to be explored in
future studies.

PNs that transform into MPNSTs often have growth
rates that exceed those of most PNs. The only MPNST
that arose during observation in this cohort (Patient 1890,
tumour 3) showed a growth rate of 28% per year. The ma-
lignancy was diagnosed at 18.9 years of age after two years
of follow up. The only NF1 patient, who developed an
MPNST in our previous longitudinal study of internal
tumours using local 2-dimensional MRI measurements
was also the only adult in that study whose tumour exhib-
ited rapid growth [7]. Since PNs usually grow slowly, if at
all, in adulthood, adults with progressive tumours on serial
MRI exams raise high suspicion for an MPNST and
should undergo further diagnostic assessment by positron
emission tomography or biopsy [14].

Benign plexiform neurofibromas may grow rapidly in
children and adolescents (Figure 3). Children and young
adults with rapidly growing tumours or large total body
tumour burden may be at especially high risk for devel-
oping an MPNST in the future, but longitudinal whole
body MRI studies with longer follow up are needed to

observation underwent transformation into a MPNST
(Patient 1890, tumour 3). One of the other two tumours
in this patient (Patient 1890, tumour 1) grew more than
20% per year during the period of observation, but none
of six benign tumours studied in four patients (1140,
1180, 1730, and 2490), who had had MPNSTs treated
prior to entry into this study grew more than 20% per
year. All of these patients were over 30 years of age at
the time of entry into the study.

Seventy-one (35.5%) of the 200 internal PNs followed
longitudinally by MRI had smaller volumes measured on
follow up than on initial exam. Among these 71 tumours,
the median measured change in volume was −3.4% per
year, and the range was −0.07% to −35.9% per year in
comparison to the volume measured on the first MRI
exam. One hundred twenty-six (63.0%) of the tumours
had larger volumes measured on follow-up MRI than on
the initial scan. The median increase in volume per year
among these 126 tumours was 7.4%. The range was
0.24% to 3667% per year.

Discussion
This is the first reported longitudinal study with whole
body MRI and three-dimensional volume measurement of
internal PNs in an unselected group of NF1 patients. We
see about 1200 individuals with NF1 each year at the NF
Centre Hamburg, and patients are referred to us by physi-
cians throughout Germany and through the German
patient
lay organization. We see a broad phenotypic
spectrum; however, because of our recognized expertise, it
is
likely that more severe and complex cases are

determine whether this is so. We note with some con-
cern that whole body tumour burdens greater than 1000
mL are distinctly unusual in the patients we studied over
40 years of age.

Patients with no internal tumours on first MRI exam-
ination are unlikely to develop new PNs later. This is
consistent with the observation that clinically apparent
PNs rarely develop in NF1 patients after early childhood
[15,16]. However, new PNs may develop, or at least first
become apparent, later in life in people with NF1, who
do have internal tumours, although this is not frequent.
One previous longitudinal MRI study of NF1 patients
reported the incidental detection of a new PN but could
not draw any conclusions regarding the likelihood of
new tumour formation [7]. MRI cannot determine when
the molecular process of tumourigenesis began, and the
rate of growth of tumours that are large enough to
image does not necessarily have any relationship to their
rate of growth earlier in tumour development. There-
fore, we do not know if the molecular process that leads
to formation of PNs always occurs before birth or if it
can also take place later in life.

An important implication of our findings for thera-
peutic research in NF1 is that it may be best to design
clinical trials for treatment of PNs to target pediatric
patients, in whom either reduction of growth rate or re-
gression of the tumour can be taken as outcome mea-
sures. For trials targeting adult patients, only tumour
regression can be taken as an outcome measure because
substantial growth of PNs is uncommon.

We found that 35.5% of the tumours in this study
showed apparent decreases in volume during the period
of observation without any medical or surgical interven-
tion. The median decrease in the volume measurements
for these tumours was 3.4% per year, with a range of
0.07% to 35.9% per year. It seems likely that many of
these tumours did not actually change in size over the
period of observation, and the difference observed repre-
sents measurement error [9]. In other instances, tumour
shrinkage may have occurred as observed with clinical
measurements during our practise. Further studies are
needed to determine the magnitude of measurement
variability in volumetric measurements of PNs obtained
by MRI and the frequency and clinical implications of
true tumour shrinkage, if it occurs. In any case, the pos-
sibility of apparent decrease in tumour size over time
needs to be considered when evaluating therapeutic effi-
cacy and treatment success in clinical trials.

that might lead to complications in the future. On the
other hand, patients without internal tumours on their
first whole body MRI appear unlikely to develop PNs
and associated complications later on. Long-term natural
history studies with serial longitudinal whole body MRI
examinations and clinical evaluation are needed to pro-
vide the evidence necessary for improving the care of
people with NF1.
