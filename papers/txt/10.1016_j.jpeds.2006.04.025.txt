Objective To assess quality of life (QoL) and psychological adjustment in children and adolescents with neuroﬁbromatosis
type 1 (NF1).
Study design Forty-six patients with NF1 were investigated between the ages of 7 and 16 years (mean, 11.6 years), with
children and parents used as informants. TNO-AZL Questionnaire for Children’s Health-Related Quality of Life and Child
Behavior Checklist scores were compared with healthy reference groups. Predictive values of sociodemographic variables,
illness-related variables, and family-related variables for quality of life and psychological adjustment were assessed.
Results Most dimensions of QoL in NF1 children and adolescents were different from reference values. Deviations in the NF1
group were an impairment of motor, cognitive, and social functioning and a reduction of positive and negative emotions. Also,
psychological adjustment in patients with NF1 was signiﬁcantly impaired compared with normal subjects. Illness-related
variables had a negative impact on the emotional domain of QoL. Good family relationships positively affected both QoL and
psychological adjustment.
Conclusions QoL and psychological adjustment are impaired in children and adolescents with NF1. Illness-related variables
and the quality of family relationships are important predictors. (J Pediatr 2006;149:348-53)

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease of the central and peripheral nervous system caused by a mutation

in a gene on chromosome 17. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant mode, with a high rate of new mutations and
a prevalence of 1 in 3000 to 4000 individuals.1 The symptoms of NF1 are progressive, unpredictable, and highly
variable, ranging from differences undetectable by the untrained observer through mild esthetic disﬁgurement to life-threatening
conditions. Deﬁning features include café-au-lait spots, axillary freckling, Lisch nodules, cutaneous and plexiform neuroﬁbro-
mas, optic gliomas, pseudoarthrosis, and scoliosis or other skeletal abnormalities.2 Complications can occur, including esthetic
disﬁgurement, skeletal abnormalities, and a variety of benign and malignant tumors of the central nervous system.1 The most
common neurologic complications of NF1 in children and adolescents are cognitive impairments.3 The diagnosis of attention
deﬁcit-hyperactivity disorder is common in children with NF1.4

The esthetic disﬁgurement and the physical and cognitive problems commonly
associated with NF1 suggest a negative impact on the quality of life (QoL) and psycho-
logical adjustment of children and adolescents. One prior study conﬁrms this suggestion
for affected adults.5 Little research, though, has focused on the psychological and social
aspects of NF1 in children and adolescents. Although the self-concept of children and
adolescents with NF1 was shown to be normal,6 behavioral and social problems were
reported.7 Compared with unaffected siblings, children with NF1 showed more overall
problem behaviors and internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems7 as well as
poorer social skills.8 In a recent study assessing personality proﬁles, children and adoles-
cents with NF1 are described as less conscientious, less emotionally stable, less open for
new experience, less active, more extravert, more dependent, and more irritable.9 Also, in
comparison with normative data, a higher occurrence of sleep and behavioral problems is
reported.10 Although there is some knowledge about psychological adjustment of indi-
viduals with NF1, studies assessing QoL in children with NF1 are lacking.

The aim of this study was a comprehensive, standardized evaluation of QoL and
psychological adjustment in children and adolescents with NF1 in comparison to healthy

children. Based on clinical anecdotal evidence, we hypothe-
sized that children and adolescents with NF1 would generally
show a reduced health-related QoL as well as more psycho-
logical adjustment problems compared with healthy children.

METHODS

Subjects

Children and adolescents with NF1 meeting the diag-
nostic criteria of the National Institutes of Health Consensus
Conference,2 previously seen at the University Children’s
Hospital in Zurich or at the Children’s Hospital in Aarau,
and their parents were asked to participate in the study. For
methodological reasons, the required age range at assessment
was 7 to 16 years, and command of the German language was
a prerequisite. Sixty-four children and adolescents met inclu-
sion criteria. One patient with additional trisomy 21 was
excluded from the study, and 17 patients refused to partici-
pate. The ﬁnal sample comprised 46 participants (response
rate, 72%).

Measures
TNO-AZL CHILD QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE
TACQOL11: The TACQOL is a generic instrument de-
signed for QoL assessment in medical research and clinical
trials. As a multidimensional instrument, it can be compared
with questionnaires such as the PedsQL,12 which is widely
used for health-related QoL studies in children and adoles-
cents in North America. The TACQOL is available in a child
form (CF) and a parent form (PF), both containing ﬁve
health status scales of eight items: physical complaints, basic
motor functioning, autonomy, cognitive, social, positive emo-
tional, and negative emotional functioning. Children and
parents are asked to note problems in any of the mentioned
domains and whether the child seems to be bothered by these
problems. Maximum domain scores are 32 for the ﬁrst ﬁve
scales and 16 for the emotional scales. Higher scores represent
a better QoL. Normal values for the child and parent forms
are provided from a community sample of healthy Dutch
children (child form: 1048 children/parent form: 1618 chil-
dren).11 Internal and external validity of the TACQOL has
been conﬁrmed in previous studies with healthy and clinical
samples.11

CHILD BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST CBCL13,14: The Child Be-
havior Checklist (CBCL) is a standardized measure with
excellent psychometric properties providing parental reports
of a child’s behavior. It consists of 120 items assessing inter-
nalizing (social withdrawal, somatic complaints, anxiety/de-
pression) and externalizing behavioral problems (dissocial and
aggressive behavior). From these problem scales, an overall
Total Behavioral Problems Score is calculated and compared
with normative data (T-score). Reference values are provided
by 2856 healthy German children and adolescents ages 4 to
18 years.14

FAMILY RELATIONSHIP INDEX FRI15: The FRI is a 27-item
questionnaire consisting of three subscales of the Family
Environment Scale, assessing expressiveness, cohesion, and
conﬂict within a family. The FRI index is calculated as the
sum of the subscales expressiveness and cohesion minus the
subscale conﬂict. Higher scores indicated better family rela-
tionships. Reliability and validity of this scale have been
conﬁrmed.15

ILLNESS-RELATED VARIABLES: Illness-related variables such
as family history of NF1 were obtained through review of the
medical records for each child. The severity of NF1 was rated
by using a modiﬁed version6 of Riccardi’s severity scale,16
which has been widely used in previous studies.5,6,8 The
modiﬁed severity scale excludes cognitive features of NF1 and
is based only on physical features. Four degrees of severity
were distinguished: Minimal NF1 includes the presence of
few features with no compromise of health or well-being.
Mild NF1 means that there are enough features present to
make the disease obvious and a source of concern, but without
signiﬁcant compromise of health. Moderate NF1 reﬂects the
presence of signiﬁcant compromise of health and well-being,
though the compromise can be reasonably well managed.
Severe NF1 indicates a serious compromise of health that is
managed with difﬁculty,
intractable, or associated with a
shortened life span. The physical features of the modiﬁed
severity scale were rated by the parents and conﬁrmed with
information from each child’s medical record.

The visibility of NF1 was scored using a scale developed
by Ablon17 that has been used in previous studies.5 Ratings
are based on the appearance of a fully dressed person. Three
different degrees of visibility were distinguished: Mild, mod-
erate, and strong visibility. Ratings are based on cutaneous
signs and features associated with gait and posture as well as
ocular movements and orbital symmetry. Final scoring of
severity and visibility was made by the ﬁrst author, under the
supervision of a neurologist with extensive experience in NF1.

SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS: Socioeconomic status (SES) was
calculated by means of a six-point scale of both paternal
occupation and maternal education. The three social classes
were deﬁned as follows: SES scores 2 to 5, lower class; SES
scores 6 to 8, middle class; and SES scores 9 to 12, upper
class. This measure has been used in previous studies and has
been shown to be a reliable and valid indicator of SES in our
community.18

Procedure

The study was approved by the local research ethics
committee. Parents were informed about the study by letter.
Children and adolescents were assessed by means of a stan-
dardized interview. The interviews lasted between 30 and 60
minutes. Most interviews were conducted in the children’s
homes. Eight were done at the hospital. Parents were assessed
at the same time point with questionnaires.

Statistical Analyses

Differences between the group of children and adoles-
cents with NF1 and the reference sample groups were exam-
ined using Student t-tests. Spearman correlations were calcu-
lated to measure associations between both child QoL and
psychological adjustment and various other variables. All
analyses were performed with two-sided tests, and a value of
P ⬍ .05 was considered signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

Sample Characteristics

A total of 43 families with 46 affected children and
adolescents participated in this study. Mean age at time of
assessment was 11.6 years (range, 7.1 to 16 years). There were
33 boys (including four brothers) and 13 girls (none of them
were sisters); sex was therefore not equally distributed (␹2 ⫽
8.7, P ⬍ .01). Severity rating indicated that seven (15.2%)
children had minimal NF1, 23 (50%) had mild, 12 (26.1%)
had moderate, and four (8.7%) had severe NF1, including
optic gliomas causing severe visual impairment (n ⫽ 2), tibial
pseudoarthrosis (n ⫽ 1), and scoliosis requiring surgery (n ⫽
1). The visibility of NF1 was distributed as follows: In 24
(52.2%) children, visibility was rated as mild, in 20 (43.5%) as
moderate, and in two (4.3%) as severe. Severity and visibility
of NF1 were not signiﬁcantly correlated (r ⫽ 0.13, P ⬍ .41).
The disease was familial in 18 (39.1%) children and sporadic
in the remaining 28 (60.9%) children. Socioeconomic status
could be calculated only for 44 children. The required data
were missing for two families. The majority of families (31 of
44; 70.5%) were from the middle class, whereas seven (15.9%)
and six (13.6%) were from the upper and lower classes,
respectively. Participants of the study did not differ signiﬁ-
cantly from nonparticipants with regard to age, sex, and
nationality. However, participants had a higher socioeco-
nomic status than nonparticipants (t ⫽ 2.57, P ⬍ .05).

Quality of Life

Means and SD of the TACQOL scores are listed in
Table I. Comparisons with the group of healthy children11
show that the means of our sample patients were signiﬁcantly
lower in most dimensions of QoL, indicating an impaired
health-related QoL in children with NF1. Children and
parents both reported a signiﬁcant impairment of motor,
cognitive, social, and emotional functioning. Agreement be-
tween child and parent ratings was low to moderate (physical
complaints: r ⫽ 0.41, P ⬍ .01; motor functioning: r ⫽ 0.05,
P ⫽ .74; autonomy: r ⫽ 0.13, P ⫽ .40; cognitive functioning:
r ⫽ 0.41, P ⬍ .05; social functioning: r ⫽ 0.17, P ⫽ .26;

children with NF1 had signiﬁcantly higher scores in all be-
havioral problem scales. Higher rates of internalizing behav-
ioral problems indicate that children with NF1 are experienc-
ing more social withdrawal, more anxiety and depressive
symptoms, and more somatic complaints. Higher rates of
externalizing behavioral problems refer to more aggressive
and dissocial behavior. Analyses of T-scores revealed that
about 39% of the sample patients had internalizing behavioral
problems and about 24% had externalizing behavioral prob-
lems in the borderline/clinical range.

Determinants of Quality of Life and Psychological
Adjustment

No associations were found between sociodemographic
variables and QoL or psychological adjustment (Table III). In
contrast, some of the illness-related variables showed signif-
icant associations with QoL. Regarding the child self-report,
both illness severity and visibility were signiﬁcantly associated
with an impaired QoL in the domain of positive emotions.
Visibility was positively associated with higher QoL in the

domain of negative emotions. In sum, children with higher
visibility experience less positive but also less negative emo-
tions. In addition, familial NF1 was found to be signiﬁcantly
correlated with more physical complaints. Parental QoL re-
port revealed a signiﬁcant negative correlation between posi-
tive emotional functioning and familial NF1. However, psy-
chological adjustment was not affected by illness-related
variables.

Family-related variables were associated with some di-
mensions of parental reported QoL and psychological adjust-
ment. High family cohesion positively affected most of the
QoL domains. Also, high family cohesion and fewer conﬂicts
had a signiﬁcant positive impact on psychological adjustment,
as measured by the three CBCL scores.

DISCUSSION

This cross-sectional analysis of health-related QoL and
its determinants in children with NF1 used multiple infor-
mants. The results are consistent with our hypothesis, indi-
cating that QoL of children and adolescents with NF1 is
impaired and psychological adjustment is disturbed. Notably,
compared with a healthy reference group, both children and
parents reported a diminished child QoL in motor, cognitive,
social, and emotional domains. Also, parents reported their
children as showing higher rates of behavioral problems in-
cluding both internalizing and externalizing behavioral prob-
lems compared with a community sample.

With regard to health-related QoL, our results are
perfectly in line with those of Wolkenstein et al5 in a popu-
lation of adults with NF1. To our knowledge, however, no
previous study has examined health-related QoL in children

with NF1. Comparisons with studies in children with other
chronic conditions clearly indicate that impairment in chil-
dren with NF1 affects more QoL domains than in diseases
such as phenylketonuria or nephrotic syndrome.18,19 Notably,
our ﬁnding of signiﬁcant limitations across all relevant health
dimensions in children with NF1 is consistent with previous
results showing that chronic conditions involving the central
nervous system are associated with more adjustment problems
than non-neurologic chronic conditions.20 Evaluation of
agreement between child and parent ratings of QoL showed
low to moderate correlations. Consistent with previous ﬁnd-
ings,19,21 we found low agreement speciﬁcally in social and
emotional domains. Not surprisingly, it seems difﬁcult for a
parent to gain insight into their child’s social and emotional
functioning, especially during adolescence.

Also, this study found higher rates of psychological
maladjustment in children with NF1 compared with a com-
munity sample. In line with previous studies reporting an
increased risk for emotional and social problems, our data also
conﬁrm higher rates of internalizing compared with external-
izing behavioral problems in children with NF1.7 Higher
rates of internalizing behavioral problems may be explained by
disease-speciﬁc neurocognitive problems, such as weariness,
which may prevent children from acting out. In addition,
methodological reasons must be considered: The CBCL-scale
“Internalizing Behavioral Problems” contains the subscale
“physical complaints.” Thus, in chronically ill children, the
occurrence of internalizing behavioral problems may be over-
estimated due to physical symptoms that are associated with
the disease.22 Higher rates of externalizing problems may

refer to elevated levels of attentional problems, which are
consistently reported in children with NF1.4

This comprehensive investigation of children and ado-
lescents with NF1 also identiﬁed several important determi-
nants of QoL and psychological adjustment. Whereas socio-
demographic variables were not signiﬁcantly associated with
QoL and psychological adjustment, illness- and family-re-
lated variables were important. Comparable with results in
adults,5 severity and visibility of the disease and the occur-
rence of familial NF1 were signiﬁcant correlates of positive
emotional and physical domains of QoL. The impact of
familial NF1 on QoL is noteworthy, since 50% of NF1 is
familial.1 There are several possible explanations for this neg-
ative effect of familial NF1. Because of impairment in the
parent’s own QoL, there might be a shared variance between
the parent’s psychological strain and the rating of their child’s
QoL.19 On the other hand, psychosocial impairment in par-
ents can negatively affect adjustment in children.23 Interest-
ingly, none of the illness-related variables had a signiﬁcant
impact on psychological adjustment in this study. This con-
tradicts previous studies reporting correlations between higher
illness severity and deviant behavior.24,25 One may speculate
that NF1-related variables interfere with daily functioning, as
measured by the QoL instruments, rather than causing sig-
niﬁcant psychological maladjustment. However, psychologi-
cal adjustment was only rated by parents, not by the children
themselves. Parents may be less aware of certain speciﬁc
problems faced by their children, since they occur outside
home.21 Also, it may be possible that parental reports of
problems in children may reﬂect parental beliefs about effects
of the disease rather than actual states of the children.

With regard to family relationships, high family cohe-
sion and fewer conﬂicts were positively related to parental
reported child QoL and psychological adjustment. This ﬁnd-
ing is new for children with NF1. However, family charac-
teristics have previously been identiﬁed as being crucial for
positive adjustment in children with chronic conditions such
as phenylketonuria, arthritis, and sickle cell disease as well as
in healthy populations.18,26,27 The pathways of family inﬂu-
ence on the psychological development of children with
chronic health conditions is not yet identiﬁed. Therefore,
these ﬁndings deserve further study and may have practical
relevance.

Strengths of this study include its use of children’s self
report and its multidimensional assessment of QoL. None-
theless, some limitations of this study merit note. First, our
sample is rather small, making statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings
more difﬁcult to achieve. Second, measuring psychological
adjustment of children with NF1 using the general population
as control subjects can be challenged, especially since the
sensitivity of the CBCL regarding the detection of NF1-
related consequences is undeﬁned. A similar concern applies
to the TACQOL. As a generic measure of health-related
QoL, it is not speciﬁcally designed for children with NF1.
However, at the time of this study, we were unable to ﬁnd a
disease-speciﬁc QoL questionnaire. Third, appropriateness of

Dutch and German norms for our sample can be questioned.
However, since the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland
are neighboring central European countries with similar his-
tory as well as political, occupational, and familial structure, a
major cross-cultural bias seems unlikely. Fourth, there may be
limitations in the use of severity and visibility gradings. How-
ever, grading scales used by Riccardi16 and Ablon17 have been
generally adopted and used in many studies. Finally, there
may be some concerns regarding our correlational ﬁndings,
since the chance of falsely signiﬁcant results increases with
more comparisons performed on the same set of data. Because
this study had an exploratory character and the limited sample
size did not allow multivariate analyses, subsequent studies are
needed to conﬁrm the ﬁndings.

This study suggests some possible issues for future
research activities. This ﬁrst application of the QoL concept
to children and adolescents with NF1 may serve as a basis for
future studies in other settings and countries. Furthermore,
the development of a NF1-speciﬁc QoL measure must be
considered. Finally, this study clearly demonstrates the im-
portance of family-related variables. Future studies should
therefore assess additional, possibly important predictors,
such as parental adjustment.

Clinical implications can be drawn from this study.
First, our ﬁndings conﬁrm the need for careful evaluation of
QoL and psychological adjustment in pediatric patients with
NF1, because both domains may be seriously affected. Sec-
ond, this study is an essential prerequisite for the development
of interventions to improve the health-related QoL of chil-
dren with NF1. Our results clearly show that the whole family
must be considered to ameliorate the QoL and psychological
adjustment in children and adolescents with NF1.
