ABSTRACT
recommended  dietary  allowance  may  prevent  osteomalacia  in
the  absence  of  sunlight, but  more  is  needed  to  help  prevent
osteoporosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Other benefits
of vitamin D supplementation are implicated epidemiologically:
prevention of some cancers, osteoarthritis progression, multiple
sclerosis, and  hypertension.  Total-body  sun  exposure  easily
provides  the  equivalent  of  250  mg  (10 000  IU)  vitamin  D/d,
suggesting  that  this  is  a  physiologic  limit.  Sailors  in  US
submarines are deprived of environmentally acquired vitamin D
equivalent  to  20–50  mg  (800–2000  IU)/d.  The  assembled  data
from many vitamin D supplementation studies reveal a curve for
vitamin D dose versus serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
response  that  is  surprisingly  flat  up  to  250  mg  (10 000  IU)
vitamin  D/d.  To  ensure  that  serum  25(OH)D  concentrations
exceed 100 nmol/L, a total vitamin D supply of 100 mg (4000 IU)/d
is  required.  Except 
those  with  conditions  causing
hypersensitivity, there  is  no  evidence  of  adverse  effects  with
serum  25(OH)D  concentrations  < 140  nmol/L, which  require  a
total  vitamin  D  supply  of  250  mg  (10 000  IU)/d  to  attain.
Published  cases  of  vitamin  D  toxicity  with  hypercalcemia, for
which  the  25(OH)D  concentration  and  vitamin  D  dose  are
known, all  involve  intake  of ‡ 1000  mg  (40 000  IU)/d.  Because
vitamin D is potentially toxic, intake of > 25 mg (1000 IU)/d has
been avoided even though the weight of evidence shows that the
currently  accepted, no  observed  adverse  effect  limit  of  50  mg
(2000  IU)/d  is  too  low  by  at  least  5-fold.

our ancestors was exposed to the sun almost daily. In contrast,
we modern humans usually cover all except about 5% of our skin
surface and it is rare for us to spend time in unshielded sunlight.
Our evolution has effectively designed us to live in the presence
of far more vitamin D (calciferol) than what most of us get now,
yet there is no consensus about what vitamin D intakes are opti-
mal or safe.

Unlike  anything  else  used  in  the  fortification  of  foods, the
purpose of vitamin D is to correct for what is an environmental
deficit (less ultraviolet exposure) and not to correct for lack due
to classical nutritional reasons. With a few exceptions reviewed
by Takeuchi et al (2), there is little or no vitamin D in the kind
of foods that humans normally eat. Therefore, conclusions about
the efficacy and safety of vitamin D must be in the context of the
role of environmental factors.

Before 1997, the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin D
(RDA; 3) for infants and children was 10 mg (400 IU). In essence,
the  scientific  basis  for  this  dose  was  that  it  approximated  what
was in a teaspoon (5 mL) of cod-liver oil and had long been con-
sidered safe and effective in preventing rickets (4). The basis for
adult vitamin D recommendations has been even more arbitrary.
Thirty-six  years  ago, an  expert  committee  on  vitamin  D  could
provide  only  anecdotal  support  for  what  it  referred  to  as  “the
hypothesis of a small requirement” for vitamin D in adults and it
recommended one-half the infant dose, just to ensure that adults
obtain some from the diet (5). In England, an adult requirement
of  only  2.5  mg  (100  IU)/d  was  substantiated  on  the  basis  of  7
adult  women  with  severe  nutritional  osteomalacia  whose  bones
showed a response when given this amount (6). The adult RDA of
5 mg (200 IU)/d was described as a “generous allowance” in the
1989  version  of  American  recommended  intakes  (3)—but  why
was this “generous” and in relation to what? It is remarkable that
despite the widespread intake of 5 mg (200 IU) vitamin D/d, there
is still no published data showing that this dose has any effect on
the serum 25(OH)D concentration in adults.

INTRODUCTION

Many arguments favoring higher intakes of calcium and other
nutrients have been based on evidence about the diets of prehis-
toric humans (1). Likewise, the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D
[25(OH)D;  calcidiol]  concentrations  of  early  humans  were
surely far higher than what is now regarded as normal. Humans
evolved as naked apes in tropical Africa. The full body surface of

25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D CONCENTRATIONS AND SAFETY

843

The  objective  way  to  assess  vitamin  D  nutritional  status  is
through the circulating 25(OH)D concentration (7, 8). Concen-
trations < 20–25 nmol/L indicate severe vitamin D deficiency (9,
10), which will lead to rickets and histologically evident osteo-
malacia (11). Concentrations between 25 and 40 nmol/L reflect
marginal  vitamin  D  deficiency  (9, 10, 12), a  situation  that  is
common in countries north of the United States, where 40 nmol/L
is  a  typical  winter  average  in  adults  (13).  Marginal  concentra-
tions  of  25(OH)D  are  associated  with  mildly  elevated  parathy-
roid  hormone  (PTH)  and  diminished  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D
[1,25(OH)2D; calcitriol] concentrations (2, 9, 10, 14).

According to Parfitt et al (7), “vitamin D deficiency implies
the  existence  of  an  anatomic, physiological, or  biochemical
abnormality that can be corrected by the administration of vita-
min  D  in  nonpharmacological  doses.” The  regression  of  PTH
versus  25(OH)D  concentrations  in  the  elderly  shows  that  PTH
concentrations  become  minimal  when  25(OH)D  concentrations
exceed  100  nmol/L  (12, 15).  Therefore, concentrations  of
25(OH)D below this may reflect deficiency in the elderly.

A report by Adams and Lee (16) has become cited as a classic
example of vitamin intoxication by individuals taking nutritional
supplements. They describe 4 subjects, 1 of whom claimed a vit-
amin D intake of 30 mg (1200 IU)/d, who presented with hyper-
calciuria that moderated after vitamin D intake was stopped. The
paper was accompanied by an editorial by Marriott (17) of the
NIH, which reemphasized concern about vitamin D intoxication.
Although  moderate  vitamin  D  supplementation  may  help  stave
off osteoporosis when it is combined with calcium (18, 19), Mar-
riott recommended care in initiating the approach (17).

The  issues  surrounding  vitamin  D  intake  for  adults  have
become confusing for both patients and physicians. For example,
a 30 mg (1200-IU)/d intake in the report by Adams and Lee was
a  possible  cause  of  vitamin  D  toxicity  in  one  subject  (16),
although essentially the same intake has been reported in 2 stud-
ies to occur in some patients with distinct vitamin D deficiency
(9, 20). How can 30 mg (1200 IU) vitamin D be insufficient for
some  and  yet  be  implicated  as  mildly  toxic  for  others?  I  will
show  that  the  confusion  can  be  explained  by  environment
because  sunshine  alone  can  bring  25(OH)D  concentrations  to
210  nmol/L  in  normal  people  and  vitamin  D  intakes  of  30  mg
(1200 IU)/d contribute only a negligible fraction of this.

A  recent  review  by  Hathcock  (21)  about  the  efficacy  and
safety of vitamins and minerals did not address vitamin D. The
newly revised daily reference intake (DRI) for vitamin D is 3-fold
higher than the previous RDA for people > 70 y of age (19), but
for most adults the DRI has remained unchanged from the 1960s
RDA of 5 mg (200 IU)/d. The purpose of the present review is to
assemble and interpret the substantial data now available about
how  vitamin  D  supply  affects  serum  25(OH)D  concentrations
and to relate these to issues of efficacy and safety of vitamin D.

ciency survey of > 30 laboratories has been available through the
North West Thames, External Quality Assurance Survey (Charing
Cross Hospital, London). In this ongoing quarterly survey, the one
method most commonly used, the INCSTAR/Dia-Sorin radioim-
munoassay (Stillwater, MN), exhibits a mean between-laboratory
CV  of  20–30%.  The  current  between-laboratory  CV  remains
essentially the same when all methods are combined (personal ﬁle
of  survey  reports).  The  variability  between  laboratories  today  is
only marginally better than that reported in 1984 for the various
methods combined (22). For the purposes of this review, it must be
assumed  that  differences  in  25(OH)D  concentration  between
group means in different publications reﬂect true differences. This
assumption cannot be avoided. Any attempt to select preferential
25(OH)D methods for data inclusion would result in the omission
of most of the information in the literature. Furthermore, the pro-
ﬁciency  data  available  show  that  selection  of  any  one  method
would result in only a marginal improvement in the CV of com-
parisons between laboratories.

Excluded  from  this  review  are  data  on  children, studies  in
which dose was not specified, and studies in which the duration
of  the  vitamin  D  dose  was  < 4  wk  (0.93  mo).  25(OH)D  values
presented  here  are  either  published  numerical  values  or  they
were  redigitized  from  graphical  data.  All  25(OH)D  values  are
presented as nmol/L (1 nmol/L = 1 ng/mL  3 2.5). Amounts of
vitamin D are given in mg, each being equivalent to 40 IU or 2.6 nmol
vitamin D3. No attempt was made to distinguish between vitamin
D2 and D3 because there was not always a distinction in the lit-
erature.  However, vitamin  D2 is  less  effective  at  raising  serum
25(OH)D concentrations than is vitamin D3 (13).

THE EVIDENCE: EFFECTS OF VITAMIN D SOURCES
ON SERUM 25(OH)D

Ultraviolet light

Serum 25(OH)D concentrations of people living or working in
sun-rich environments are summarized in  Table 1. The highest
individual  serum  25(OH)D  concentration  obtained  from  sun-
shine was 225 nmol/L (23); in a farmer in Puerto Rico—there is
no reason to think that he was taking a vitamin D supplement. In
a report showing results for 391 subjects that excluded individu-
als taking calcium or vitamin D supplements, Dawson-Hughes et
al (14) reported 3 subjects with serum 25(OH)D concentrations
> 200  nmol/L.  From  the  data  of  Chapuy  et  al  (26), as  well  as
those  of  Dawson  Hughes  et  al  (12), the  upper  limits  (+2  SDs,
97.5th  percentile)  were, respectively, 150  and  212  nmol/L  in
subjects taking only 20 mg (800 IU) vitamin D/d. Such concen-

More than for any other analyte in the endocrine test repertoire,
circulating 25(OH)D concentrations vary by geography (latitude),
culture, and legislation (food fortiﬁcation laws). Technical issues
also  arise  when  results  from  different  studies  are  compared
because assays of 25(OH)D vary. In the survey reported in 1984
by Jongen et al (22) of 19 laboratories, the mean CV for plasma
25(OH)D was 35%, much of which was attributable to the puriﬁ-
cation procedures used. Over the past 6 y, an international proﬁ-

trations are consistent with subgroups of individuals exposed to
relatively more sunshine.

The  effects  of  artiﬁcial  ultraviolet  light  treatment  sessions  on
25(OH)D concentrations are summarized in Table 2. The highest
individual 25(OH)D concentration attained was 274 nmol/L (38).
The main problem in interpreting the data was that the exact dose
of ultraviolet light was ambiguous because there is variability in
the surface area of skin exposed and in the frequency and duration
of exposure. Had the ultraviolet treatment sessions continued, one
would  expect  that  for  those  given  full-body  exposure, serum
25(OH)D concentrations would plateau at mean values compara-
ble with those of the farmers and lifeguards shown in Table 1.

Two studies showed that in response to a given set of ultravi-
olet light treatment sessions, the absolute rise in serum 25(OH)D
concentration  was  inversely  related  to  the  basal  25(OH)D  con-
centration.  In  the  study  by  Mawer  et  al  (34), the  increase  in

25(OH)D  in  subjects  with  initial  25(OH)D  concentrations 
< 25 nmol/L was double the increase seen in subjects with initial
concentrations > 50 nmol/L. Snell et al (27) showed that in sub-
jects with initial 25(OH)D concentrations < 10 nmol/L, ultravio-
let  treatments  increased  25(OH)D  by  30  nmol/L, but  in  those
with initial 25(OH)D concentrations approaching 50 nmol/L, the
increase was negligible.

At least 4 studies support the concept that one full-body expo-
sure to sunlight can be equivalent to an oral vitamin D intake of
250 mg (10 000 IU). Stamp (39) compared oral vitamin D to the
effects of ultraviolet light treatment sessions and found that the
rise in 25(OH)D was the same in subjects treated with ultravio-
let light as in those given 250 mg (10 000 IU) vitamin D/d. In a
study of institutionalized elderly, Davie et al (28) exposed 600 cm2,
<5% of skin surface, to ultraviolet light treatments over a 2–3-mo
period and compared the resulting 25(OH)D concentrations with

those achieved with oral vitamin D doses. They calculated a pro-
duction of vitamin D in the skin equivalent to 0.045 nmol·d21·cm22
exposed skin. This is equivalent to 10.9 mg (435 IU) vitamin D/d for
5%  of  skin  surface.  An  almost  identical  protocol  was  followed
recently  by  Chel  et  al  (30), confirming  the  relative  effects  of
light  and  supplementation  on  25(OH)D  concentration  (28).  If
these results for the elderly are extrapolated to total body surface
area, it works out to 218 mg (8700 IU) vitamin D/d that can be
acquired  by  the  elderly.  More  recently, Holick  (40)  presented
data  that  compared  blood  vitamin  D  concentrations  in  subjects
taking vitamin D orally with those given ultraviolet light expo-
sure.  The  ultraviolet  treatment  produced  blood  vitamin  D 
concentrations  comparable  with  an  intake  of  250–625  mg
(10 000–25 000 IU) vitamin D/d orally.

Ultraviolet exposure beyond the minimal erythemal dose does
not  increase  vitamin  D  production  further.  The  ultraviolet-
induced production of vitamin D precursors is counterbalanced
by degradation of vitamin D and its precursors. The concentra-
tion of previtamin D in the skin reaches an equilibrium in white
skin within 20 min of ultraviolet exposure (41). Although it can
take  3–6  times  longer  for  pigmented  skin  to  reach  the  equilib-
rium  concentration  of  dermal  previtamin  D, skin  pigmentation
does  not  affect  the  amount  of  vitamin  D  that  can  be  obtained
through sunshine exposure (42). However, aging does lower the
amount of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin and lowers substan-
tially the capacity for vitamin D production (43, 44).

Effect of acute onset of ultraviolet light deprivation

Most  of  what  is  known  about  ultraviolet  light  deprivation  is
summarized in Table 3. The most recent data are for an Ameri-
can  submarine  crew  (46), which  show  a  percentage  decline  in
25(OH)D concentration comparable with that of a British crew
reported 20 y earlier (45). The 30-nmol/L decline over 2 mo was
despite  “a  standard  US  Navy  diet  which  included  milk  and
breakfast cereals fortified with vitamin D” (46). The initial mean
25(OH)D concentration was higher in the Americans than in the
British, consistent with higher vitamin D supplies from diet and
sun exposure in Americans.

Effect of daily vitamin D supplementation

Studies reporting a specified vitamin D intake and the result-
ing serum 25(OH)D concentration are summarized in Table 4. It
is  important  in  this  kind  of  comparison  to  know  whether  the
treatments had achieved an equilibrium concentration in terms of
25(OH)D. The half-life of 25(OH)D in the circulation is reported
as <1 mo in humans (68), the results for the submariners suggest
a 2-mo half-life (Table 3). Conventional pharmacology indicates
it  should  take  4  half-lives  before  a  drug’s  equilibrium  is

achieved. Unlike a conventional drug, 25(OH)D is a metabolite
whose concentration can be altered through balance between its
production and clearance so that an equilibrium can be achieved
earlier than would be expected from the half-life. To permit some
sort of comparison between the various studies in the literature,
it was necessary to compromise on classical pharmacology. The
data in Figure 1 show that serum 25(OH)D is essentially at the
plateau concentration by 1 mo (28, 64). Therefore, the results for
25(OH)D of studies in which the vitamin D supplementation was
continued for a minimum of 4 wk (0.93 mo) are summarized in
Table 4. The eventual plateau of 25(OH)D concentration may be
slightly underestimated in some cases.

25(OH)D with pharmacologic doses of vitamin D and in
cases of vitamin D toxicity

Reports  in  which  pharmacologic  doses  of  vitamin  D  were
given  for  a  prolonged  time  and  in  which  the  resulting  serum
25(OH)D  concentrations  were  provided  are  summarized  in
Table 5. Eventually, as 25(OH)D concentrations rise, the classic
situation of hypercalcemia becomes evident. Hypercalcemia due
to vitamin D intoxication per se is always accompanied by serum
25(OH)D concentrations > 220 nmol/L (70, 75, 77).

Pettifor et al (78) measured the free 1,25(OH)2D concentration
in 11 people intoxicated by the erroneous consumption of a vita-
min D concentrate that they had used as cooking oil. The serum
25(OH)D  concentrations  in  these  patients  covered  the  range
(300–1000 nmol/L) that was required in the study of Heaney et al
(79)  to  show  a  calcium-absorptive  response  to  serum  25(OH)D
itself.  The  mean  serum  free  1,25(OH)2D  fraction  in  the  study
group of Pettifor et al was double the mean for normal individu-
als, implicating free 1,25(OH)2D as a contributor to toxicity when
25(OH)D concentrations match those used by Heaney et al. Not
all  of  the  subjects  in  Pettifor  et  al’s  study  had  elevated  free
1,25(OH)2D, yet all subjects were hypercalcemic; therefore, the
most likely agent causing vitamin D toxicity was a combination
of inappropriate activity of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D.

The data of Table 5 were incorporated into Figure 2 to show
the relation between vitamin D intake and the serum 25(OH)D
concentrations  achieved.  Not  all  of  the  high-dose  vitamin  D
intake data involve vitamin D intoxication. There is one case of
an individual with vitamin D toxicity for which the intake was
250 mg (10 000 IU)/d.

Depot injection or intermittent large oral dosing with
vitamin D

Another  way  to  augment  vitamin  D  nutrition  has  been  to
administer  vitamin  D  as  a  single  large  dose, either  orally  or
through injection. Because vitamin D has a half-life > 1 or 2 mo,

a  large  dose  should  suffice  for  the  better  part  of  a  year.  The
approach  is  often  called  stoss  therapy  (from  the  German  for  to
bump) and it is most common in Europe. One Finnish study, by
Heikinheimo et al (80), concluded that annual injection of vita-
min  D2 in  the  autumn  (3750–7500  mg, or  150 000–300 000  IU)
can  lower  the  probability  of  osteoporotic  fractures  by  <25%.
Note that before treatment, the mean 25(OH)D concentration in
the  untreated  control  subjects  was  only  16  nmol/L, and  thus,
much of the fracture prevention appears to have been attributable
to raising 25(OH)D concentrations out of the osteomalacic range.
The effects of single large doses of vitamin D are summarized
in Table 6. Only a few studies monitored serum 25(OH)D con-
centrations during the days, weeks, or months after administra-
tion of large doses of vitamin D. Both Davie et al (28) and Weis-
man  et  al  (87)  showed  that  with  oral  dosing,
there  was  a
relatively rapid peak in serum 25(OH)D concentration, with con-

FIGURE 1. Effect of the duration of vitamin D supplementation on the
mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration achieved. Vita-
min D intakes for the groups were as follows: 10 mg (400 IU)/d (+; 28), 25 mg
(1000 IU)/d (X; 28), 50 mg (2000 IU)/d (h; 64), 250 mg (10000 IU)/d (j; 28).

centrations  falling  progressively  afterward.  When  doses  were
administered  intramuscularly,
there  was  a  longer-lasting
response in terms of serum 25(OH)D. However, in some cases it
took  <2  mo  for  the  peak  concentration  to  be  achieved.  In  the
study by Heikinheimo et al (80), serum 25(OH)D concentrations
after  injection  remained  higher  than  those  of  the  control  group
for the entire year.

Reliability  of  intermittent  dosing  was  poor  because  of  wide
variability in the serum 25(OH)D concentrations achieved, both
between  individuals  and  in  each  individual  over  time.  Conse-
quently, the  dose-response  graph  of  Figure  2  does  not  include
results from groups given single large injections.

ASSESSMENT OF EVIDENCE

Objectives achieved with vitamin D intake
recommendations

If  the  objective  of  vitamin  D  supplementation  is  simply  to
avoid  severe  osteomalacia, then  the  2.5  mg  (100  IU)/d  require-
ment  suggested  by  Dent  and  Smith  (89)  might  be  adequate  for
some individuals. Supplementation with 10 mg (400 IU) vitamin D/d
raises 25(OH)D by <45 nmol/L (28, 30, 47, 56, 90). By extrap-
olating  downward,
it  appears  that  the  commonly  consumed
amount of 5 mg (200 IU)/d may be sufficient, as a sole source of
vitamin D, to maintain average serum 25(OH)D concentrations
at 25 nmol/L, but there are no data to verify this.

There is a prevalent view that occasional exposure of the face
and  hands  to  sunlight  is  “sufficient” for  vitamin  D  nutrition.
Indeed, this exposure can provide 5–10 mg (200–400 IU) vitamin D
during those months when the appropriate sunlight is available.
However, a  5%  skin  exposure  produces  a  mean  25(OH)D  con-
centration of only 35 nmol/L (28), which would leave more than
half  of  the  population  vitamin  D  insufficient.  Gloth  et  al  (20)
found that in homebound, American elderly, the mean vitamin D
intake  was  12.9  mg  (517  IU)/d, resulting  in  a  mean  25(OH)D
concentration  of  40  nmol/L.  Interestingly, for  subjects  with

serum 25(OH)D concentrations < 25 nmol/L, the mean vitamin D
intake was 11.7 mg (467 IU)/d. Apparently, some people require
more  vitamin  D  than  others  to  reach  a  given  concentration  of
25(OH)D in serum. More recent reports show that dietary vita-
min D intake correlates poorly with 25(OH)D concentrations (2,
9)  and  that  25(OH)D  concentrations  can  hover  around  what  is
considered  to  be  marginal  deficiency  (38  nmol/L)  despite  con-
sumption of the recommended amount of vitamin D (9). Ultravi-
olet  exposure  and  time  spent  outdoors  are  better  predictors  of
25(OH)D  concentration  than  is  dietary  vitamin  D  intake  (9).
Obviously, the  current, arbitrarily  set  vitamin  D  intakes  play  a
minor role in the total economy of vitamin D for most adults.

If the objective is to optimize the probability of good health,
then it seems reasonable that the daily vitamin D supply should
be  > 20  mg  (800  IU)/d.  In  both  of  the  well-accepted  studies
showing  osteoporosis  fracture  prevention  with  vitamin  D  and

calcium, mean  25(OH)D  concentrations  exceeded  100  nmol/L
(12, 26). The osteoporosis studies of Chapuy et al (26) and Heik-
inheimo  et  al  (86)  have  been  interpreted  as  evidence  that  the
value of the vitamin supplement is simply to raise 25(OH)D con-
centrations  out  of  the  osteomalacic  or  insufficient  range.  How-
ever, patients  in  the  recent  study  of  Dawson-Hughes  et  al  (12)
started off with perfectly acceptable basal 25(OH)D concentra-
tions  of  61  nmol/L  and  still  derived  benefit.  Target  25(OH)D
concentrations exceeding 100 nmol/L would also minimize PTH
concentrations because the decrease in 25(OH)D with age has a
greater  effect  on  the  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  of  aging
than does the decline in renal function (10).

For most drugs and hormones, the relevant serum concentration
attained is more important than is the actual intake of the agent.
The recent increase in the DRI for vitamin D for adults > 50 y of
age was based on evidence of fracture prevention with vitamin D

FIGURE 2. Dose response for vitamin D intake versus final serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration reported. Circles indicate group
means from Tables 4 and 5. Points indicated by “X” represent single values from Table 5 for people reported as intoxicated with vitamin D. The arrow
indicates the lowest dose reported as causing hypercalcemia, but which is an outlier because vitamin D was given as a single dose of 7500 mg (300 000
IU)/mo, instead of 250 mg (10 000 IU)/d (77). If authors reported 25(OH)D for several time points, only the final serum 25(OH)D is shown in the fig-
ure. The line representing the dose response passes through the points that represent group data.

and calcium, as shown by Dawson-Hughes et al (12) and Chapuy
et al (26). In both of those studies, mean serum 25(OH)D concen-
trations  exceeded  100  nmol/L, which  was  unusual.  Of  the  21
groups summarized in Table 4 to whom vitamin D was given at
doses between 20 and 75 mg (800 and 3000 IU)/d, it was only the
subjects in these 2 studies that attained average 25(OH)D concen-
trations > 100 nmol/L (12, 26), except for subjects who lived near
the equator (55). Calcium supplementation would not account for
the unusual results because calcium by itself does not affect serum
25(OH)D in elderly women (91). A glance at Table 4 will show
that to ensure the desirable objective of mean 25(OH)D concen-
trations > 100 nmol/L, the total vitamin D supply from dietary and
environmental sources must be 100 mg (4000 IU)/d. This view is
also  based  on  the  results  of  recent  unpublished  work  (R  Vieth,
1998) and on reference 67.

The  objective  of  vitamin  D  supplementation  should  be  to
compensate  for  insufficient  ultraviolet  light  exposure.  Studies
in  submariners  offer  a  reasonable  way  to  estimate  the  decre-
ment in vitamin D. A low estimate for the vitamin D decrement
of  submariners  is  15  mg  (600  IU)  vitamin  D2/d.  This  was
inferred by Holick on the basis of a small (n = 11) unpublished
study done in 1984 that compared supplemented and unsupple-
mented sailors. Unfortunately, neither the actual 25(OH)D con-
centrations  nor  statistical  significance  were  provided, and  the
summary  includes  the  unreasonable  observation  that  final
25(OH)D concentrations were 23% higher in subjects not taking
any vitamin D (92). Studies with more complete data are sum-
marized  in Table  3.  One  way  to  estimate  the  serum  25(OH)D
that may have been lost in the submariners reported on by Dlu-

gos  et  al  (46)  is  to  determine  the  level  of  vitamin  D  supple-
mentation that would sustain their initial 25(OH)D concentra-
tion of 78 nmol/L. Data in Table 4 show that an additional sup-
plement of 10–25 mg (400–1000 IU) may be required to sustain
the sailors’ initial 25(OH)D concentrations. This is probably an
underestimate  because  none  of  the  vitamin  D–supplemented
subjects  were  totally  sun  deprived.  Another  approach  to  esti-
mating  the  submariners’ vitamin  D  decrement  could  be  based
on  the  amount  of  vitamin  D  required  to  produce  the  opposite
effect on serum 25(OH)D within the same time period. In Table
4, it can be seen that MacLennan and Hamilton (63) reported in
1977  that  50  mg  (2000  IU)  vitamin  D/d  increased  25(OH)D
concentrations  from  basal  values  of  15  to  final  values  of  81
nmol/L. This was verified by Himmelstein et al (64), who showed
that 2 mo of 50 mg (2000 IU) vitamin D/d raised serum 25(OH)D
concentrations from the initial 40 to 80 nmol/L (Figure 1). On
this basis, the sailors were deprived of <50 mg (2000 IU) envi-
ronmental  vitamin  D/d  during  the  time  they  were  confined  to
the submarine.

Other reasons to consider increasing vitamin D nutrition

There are nonclassical and less well substantiated reasons to
consider increasing vitamin D nutrition. As discussed above, the
biochemical  criterion  of  PTH  suppression  suggests  that
25(OH)D  concentrations  > 100  nmol/L  are  desirable  in  elderly
subjects (12, 15). Epidemiologic studies show that higher serum
25(OH)D concentrations or environmental ultraviolet light expo-
sure are associated with lower rates of breast, ovarian, prostate,
and  colorectal  cancers  (93–100).  There  is  impressive  circum-

stantial evidence that multiple sclerosis is more prevalent in pop-
ulations having lower concentrations of vitamin D or ultraviolet
exposure  (98, 101), and  there  are  suggestions  that  vitamin  D
intake ranging from 32.5 to 95 mg (1300 to 3800 IU)/d helps pre-
vent  the  disease  (101).  The  probability  that  established
osteoarthritis  will  progress  to  a  more  severe  stage  is  reduced
with  better  vitamin  D  nutritional  status, based  both  on  serum
25(OH)D concentrations and diet history. On the basis of these
results, McAlindon  et  al  (102)  recommended  that  serum
25(OH)D should exceed 75 nmol/L in persons with osteoarthri-
tis of the knee. The prevalence of hypertension in a population
increases with distance north or south of the equator (103), and
it was reported recently that hypertension becomes less severe in
subjects  whose  25(OH)D  concentrations  are  increased  to  > 100
nmol/L through ultraviolet exposure (38). Vitamin D deficiency
impairs immune function in animals (104), and in children there
is a strong association between pneumonia and nutritional rick-
ets (105). Vitamin D nutrition probably affects major aspects of
human health other than its classical role in mineral metabolism;
however, the  evidence  is  not  conclusive  enough  yet  to  warrant
considering these other potential health benefits as objectives in
nutritional  guidelines.  If  any  of  this  evidence  were  taken  into

consideration it would require substantial upward revision of the
current DRI.

Some investigators found no statistically significant relations
between serum 25(OH)D concentrations in archived tissue sam-
ples  and  eventual  prostate  cancer  death  (106, 107). Two  points
seem to have been missed in these studies. First, 25(OH)D con-
centrations vary with season and this will confound conventional
approaches to cancer follow-up. Second, modern society in gen-
eral  is  vitamin  D–deprived  compared  with  prehistoric  humans.
The concentrations of 25(OH)D observed today are arbitrary and
based on contemporary cultural norms (clothing, sun avoidance,
food choices, and legislation) and the range of vitamin D intakes
being compared may not encompass what is natural or optimal
for humans as a species.

Dose-response curve of 25(OH)D concentration versus
vitamin D intake

The serum 25(OH)D concentration is maintained within a nar-
row range (Figure 2), <75–220 nmol/L across vitamin D supplies
from  20 mg  (800  IU)  to  the  physiologic  limit  of  250–500 mg
(10 000–20 000  IU)/d.  The  most  reasonable  explanation  for  this
kind of relation is that there are homeostatic control systems to

regulate serum 25(OH)D and to buffer against variability in vit-
amin  D  supply. The  metabolic  points  at  which  serum  25(OH)D
can be regulated include the concentration of 25-hydroxylase in
the  liver  (108), the  catabolism  of  25(OH)D  by  the  liver  into
breakdown products excreted into bile (109), and the catabolism
of 25(OH)D via the side-chain cleavage pathway initiated by 24-
hydroxylase  present  in  tissues  throughout  the  body  (110).
Beyond  the  vitamin  D  supply  limit, which  is  comparable  with
that attainable with sunshine, there is a classic rise in the dose-
response curve. The sharp rise reflects the introduction of vita-
min D and 25(OH)D at rates that exceed the capabilities of the
various mechanisms to regulate 25(OH)D.

One  case  illustrates  the  physiologic  limit  well.  The  patient,
who had primary hypoparathyroidism, is indicated by the arrow
in Figure 2. This data point is an outlier because it is clearly the
highest  serum  25(OH)D  concentration  within  the  physiologic
range of vitamin D intake. Although this subject did not take a
remarkably  large  dose  of  vitamin  D  daily, the  effect  was  toxic
because the dose was taken as a single monthly dose of 7500 mg
(300 000  IU)  (77).  This  exceeded  by  30-fold  the  physiologic
range and resulted in the production of more 25(OH)D than the
body  had  the  capacity  to  clear  from  the  system  at  one  time—
hence toxicity with one form of stoss therapy.

Aside from the vitamin D supply itself, endocrine and dietary
factors affect circulating 25(OH)D. In rats, both low (109, 111)
and  excessively  high  calcium  intakes  (111)  can  lower  serum
25(OH)D  concentrations.  The  calcium-raising  hormones  each
tend  to  lower  serum  25(OH)D.  In  hypoparathyroid  humans,
1,25(OH)2D  treatment  speeds  up  the  metabolic  clearance  of
25(OH)D from the circulation (68). In hyperparathyroid humans,
there is accelerated clearance of 25(OH)D (112).

The preceding discussion highlights the fact that 1,25(OH)2D is
not  the  only  metabolite  that  is  regulated  in  the  vitamin  D
endocrine  system.  The  purpose  of  the  mechanisms  to  regulate
25(OH)D  concentrations  may  be  to  optimize  the  availability  of
25(OH)D for tissues that require it, either for its direct action (79),
or as the source of substrate for nonrenal, paracrine 1-hydroxylase
(calcidiol 1-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.13.13) (113).

Lowest dose causing harm

The recent paper by Adams and Lee (16) about mild vitamin
D toxicity defined elevated 25(OH)D as anything > 125 nmol/L,
which was the upper limit of the reference range stated by their refer-
ral laboratory. Their subject with the highest concentration of urinary
calcium had a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 140 nmol/L, and this
was on only one occasion. When this subject’s serum 25(OH)D fell
to 102 and then to 75 nmol/L, the urinary ratio of calcium to crea-
tinine remained unchanged at its highest value, suggesting some
other metabolic cause of the hypercalciuria. The other cases in
the  report  more  closely  resemble  those  given  milk  excessively
supplemented with vitamin D reported by Jacobus et al (114) or
those in the poisoned household reported by Pettifor et al (78).
Except for the report by Adams and Lee (16), all instances of
vitamin D toxicity have involved serum 25(OH)D concentrations
in excess of 200 nmol/L (Table 5). Adams and Lee came across
their putative cases of vitamin D intoxication by checking urinary
calcium  concentrations  in  patients  screened  in  an  osteoporosis
evaluation.  Certainly, the  first  sign  of  vitamin  D  excess  would
involve  an  increase  in  urinary  calcium, but  whether  this  occurs
with physiologic 25(OH)D concentrations in healthy individuals
is  by  no  means  established  by  their  study  (115, 116).  Further-

more, Adams later stated that the subjects had consumed amounts
of vitamin D “at least one order of magnitude greater than” what
was on the label (ie, ‡ 10 times 30 mg or 1200 IU/d) (117).

Dawson-Hughes  et  al  (14)  found  25(OH)D  concentrations
comparable  with  those  of  Adams  and  Lee’s  subjects  in  <20
healthy elderly men and women who were not taking vitamin D
supplements.  Likewise, presumably  healthy  farmers  in  Puerto
Rico  and  lifeguards  also  had  such  25(OH)D  concentrations
(Table 1). Although not strictly within the “normal” range for a
clothed, sun-avoiding  population, serum  25(OH)D  concentra-
tions £ 220 nmol/L are consistent with certain environments, are
not unusual in the absence of vitamin D supplements, and should
be regarded as being within the physiologic range for humans.

The report of Adams and Lee (16), together with its accompa-
nying  editorial, suggest  that  serum  25(OH)D  concentrations  as
low as 140 nmol/L are harmful. This is alarmist. Are we to start
avoiding the sun for fear of raising urine calcium or increasing
bone resorption? The question has never been addressed objec-
tively. My view is that there is no harm in the 25(OH)D concen-
trations  associated  with  sun  exposure  and  that  such  concentra-
tions are probably optimal for human health.

Higher  rates  of  osteoporosis  and  arteriosclerosis  have  been
attributed to virtually any vitamin D intake (118). Furthermore,
the US National Academy of Sciences (3) indicated in 1989 that
the  toxic  dose  of  vitamin  D  can  be  as  low  as  “five  times  the
RDA.” This view now seems to have been carried forward to the
latest set of vitamin D recommendations, in which the tolerable
upper intake level is indicated as 50 mg (2000 IU)/d (19).

Throughout my preparation of this review, I was amazed at the
lack  of  evidence  supporting  statements  about  the  toxicity  of
moderate doses of vitamin D. Consistently, literature citations to
support  them  have  been  either  inappropriate  or  without  sub-
stance. The statement in the 1989 US nutrition guidelines that 5
times the RDA for vitamin D may be harmful (3) relates back to
a 1963 expert committee report (5), which then refers back to the
primary reference, a 1938 report in which linear bone growth in
infants was suppressed in those given 45–157.7 mg (1800–6300 IU)
vitamin D/d (119). The citation is not related to adult nutrition
and it does not form a scientific basis for a safe upper limit in
adults.  The  same  applies  to  the  statement  in  the  1987  Council
Report  for  the American  Medical Association  that  “dosages  of
10,000 IU/d for several months have resulted in marked distur-
bances in calcium metabolism…and, in some cases, death.” Two
references were cited to substantiate this. One was a review arti-
cle  about  vitamins  in  general, which  gave  no  evidence  for  and
cited  no  other  reference  to  its  claim  of  toxicity  at  vitamin  D
doses  as  low  as  250  mg  (10 000  IU)/d  (120).  The  other  paper
cited in the report dealt with 10 patients with vitamin D toxicity
reported  in  1948, for  whom  the  vitamin  D  dose  was  actually
3750–15 000 mg (150 000–600 000 IU)/d, and all patients recov-
ered  (121).  If  there  is  published  evidence  of  toxicity  in  adults
from an intake of 250  mg (10 000 IU)/d, and that is verified by
the 25(OH)D concentration, I have yet to find it.

The issue of poorly substantiated claims of toxicity extends even
to the most recent, 1997, revision for vitamin D intakes published
by the National Academy of Sciences (19). The only study cited to
address  the  question  of  critical  endpoint  doses  for  vitamin  D
(potential adverse effect levels) was an esoteric article by Narang
et  al  (122).  The  basis  for  the  current  no  observed  adverse  effect
level (NOAEL) of 50 mg (2000 IU)/d is that Narang et al reported
a mean serum calcium concentration >11 mg/dL(2.25 mmol/L) in

the  6  normal  subjects  given  95  mg  (3800  IU)  vitamin  D/d.  That
intake was then deﬁned as the lowest observed adverse effect level
(LOAEL). The next lowest test dose used by Narang et al, 60 mg
(2400  IU)/d, with  20%  less  as  the  safety  margin, became  the
NOAEL. Narang et al reported only serum electrolyte changes, the
doses of vitamin D were not veriﬁed, and 25(OH)D concentrations
were not reported. The National Academy committee missed evi-
dence showing the safety of larger doses of vitamin D. Directly com-
parable with the protocol of Narang et al (122) is the study by Tjelle-
sen et al (67), in which 19 normal subjects were given 95 mg (3800 IU)
vitamin D2 or 110 mg (4400 IU) vitamin D3/d (these doses were vali-
dated  by  direct  assay)  (Table  4).  Serum  calcium  increased  by  a
minute, but statistically signiﬁcant, 0.05 mmol/L (0.12 mg/dL) with
110 mg (4400 IU) vitamin D3 and there was an increase in urinary
calcium, as  one  should  expect  with  improved  intestinal  calcium
absorption. Another report indicative of the safety of larger doses is
by  Stern  et  al  (84), who  administered  vitamin  D2 at  2500  mg
(100000 IU)/d for 4 d (Table 6). This represented a far greater stress
to the vitamin D system because it delivered in 4 d a total vitamin D
dose equivalent to what Narang et al used over 3 mo. Nonetheless,
Stern et al (84) detected no signiﬁcant effects on serum calcium in
the 24 normal adult subjects they treated in this way.

The mechanism causing vitamin D toxicity involves the unbri-
dled expression of 1,25(OH)2D-like activity. Whether 1,25(OH)2D
or  25(OH)D  is  the  main  signaling  molecule  causing  vitamin  D
toxicity remains a point of contention. There is a growing likeli-
hood  that  25(OH)D  has  biological  activity  in  its  own  right. The
concentration of 25(OH)D is often reported to be better correlated
with absorption of calcium from the gut than is serum 1,25(OH)2D
(123, 124). Recently, Heaney et al (79) showed that the circulating
25(OH)D  concentration  affects  intestinal  calcium  absorption.
However, to show this, it was necessary to raise serum 25(OH)D
concentrations into the range of 300–1000 nmol/L, and this is well
beyond what could be considered physiologic.

As  vitamin  D  doses  increase, the  mechanisms  to  explain  the
toxic responses are 3-fold: 1) a possible conversion of vitamin D3
to 5,6-trans-vitamin D3, which contains a pseudo-1-a group; 2) a
direct action of 25(OH)D at the 1,25(OH)2D receptor (79); or 3)
an unbridled production of 1,25(OH)2D with inappropriate main-
tenance  of  its  total  concentration  in  the  circulation  despite  its
displacement  from  vitamin  D  binding  protein  to  increase  free
1,25(OH)2D (78, 125). The opinion that 95 mg (3800 IU) vitamin D/d
is the LOAEL (19) is not consistent with these current theories
of why vitamin D is toxic and is not consistent with the amounts
of  vitamin  D  needed  to  raise  25(OH)D  concentrations  to  the
hypercalcemic  levels  reported  in  all  studies  in  which  serum
25(OH)D is related to toxicity.

Fraser (126) speculated that orally acquired vitamin D might
be particularly toxic because it enters the body via an unnatural
route for this nutrient. This hypothesis has never been put to the
test. It does seem reasonable that the metabolism of vitamin D
acquired  through  the  skin  might  be  more  finely  regulated  than
that of vitamin D obtained orally. Haddad et al (127) showed that
the transport of vitamin D in the circulation is different for vita-
min D acquired by dermal and oral routes. Oral vitamin D is pri-
marily  transported  along  with  chylomicrons  and  lipoproteins
until it is cleared by the liver within hours, whereas dermal vita-
min D is transported on vitamin D binding protein and takes days
to clear. We recently observed that the apparent self-regulation of
25-hydroxylase  first  observed  for  vitamin  D  generated  in  skin
(27, 34) pertains equally well to vitamin D acquired orally. Oral

vitamin  D  supplementation  produced  the  greatest  increase  in
25(OH)D  in  those  who  initially  had  the  lowest  25(OH)D  con-
centrations (13). From what is known now, there is no practical
difference  whether  vitamin  D  is  acquired  from  ultraviolet
exposed skin or through the diet.

Hypersensitivity to vitamin D

Hypersensitivity to vitamin D can occur (128). Primary hyper-
parathyroidism is probably the most common example. It would
be simplistic to avoid or minimize vitamin D intake because of
this.  Before  the  occurrence  of  hyperparathyroidism, vitamin  D
nutrition  is  preventive  because  it  reduces  parathyroid  secretion
and lowers the likelihood of parathyroid hyperplasia (129–131).
Once  primary  hyperparathyroidism  exists, production  of
1,25(OH)2D  is  persistently  up-regulated  by  the  high  PTH  con-
centrations, and  1,25(OH)2D  concentrations  correlate  directly
with serum 25(OH)D (132). In hyperparathyroid individuals, vit-
amin  D  exaggerates  hypercalcemia  because  of  the  connection
between vitamin D nutrition and 1,25(OH)2D production. Vita-
min D deficiency can mask primary hyperparathyroidism (132)
and this could account for the occasional cases of hypercalcemia
that  occur  when  large  groups  of  elderly  people  are  given  vita
min D supplements (133). Some patients with sarcoidosis, tuber-
culosis, or lymphoma become hypercalcemic in response to any
increase  in  vitamin  D  nutrition  (122, 134, 135).  For  these  per-
sons, it  may  be  prudent  to  avoid  any  dietary  or  environmental
sources of vitamin D.

Efficacy and safety

Although the new DRI for vitamin D for most adults is 5 mg
(200  IU)/d  (19), the  beneficial  amount  is  more  likely  to  be
10–12.5 mg (800–1000 IU)/d, on the basis of bone density meas-
urements and fracture prevention in the elderly (12, 18, 26). For
this reason, DRIs have been increased for those > 70 y of age to
600 IU/d. This intake will also lessen the chance of vitamin D
deficiency–induced  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  and  will
bring serum 25(OH)D concentrations closer to those associated
with other health benefits. Even if all adults consumed 12.5  mg
(1000  IU)/d, it  would  be  difficult  to  detect  an  increase  in  the
number of individuals with 25(OH)D concentrations > 140 nmol/L
because ‡ 90% of the vitamin D contributing to such concentra-
tions would be from sunshine exposure, not oral intake.

The assignment of a NOAEL, as defined by Hathcock (21), or
allowable “tolerable upper intake level,” as defined by the Food
and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine (19), is especially dif-
ficult  for  vitamin  D.  Because  of  environmental  input, the  con-
centration referred to must be that of 25(OH)D in the circulation
and not simply dietary vitamin D. Another consideration is that
rare individuals are hypersensitive to vitamin D. There is no sim-
ple answer here because the primary disease may be made more
likely to occur by previous vitamin D deficiency (129). The fol-
lowing discussion disregards the possibility of vitamin D hyper-
sensitivity.  If  it  exists, hypersensitivity  would  appear  to  negate
the value of any vitamin D intake or sunshine exposure.

For vitamin D, a NOAEL could define the highest 25(OH)D
concentration  not  suspected  to  cause  hypercalciuria  in  healthy
subjects. As discussed above, it could be difficult to prove that
vitamin D is the cause of hypercalciuria because the condition is
commonly caused by other things and it is a mild and nonclassi-
cicl criterion for vitamin D intoxication. Nonetheless, because of
the  hypothesized  predisposition  to  hypercalciuria  of  the  Israeli

lifeguards (25) and of the subjects in the study of Adams and Lee
(16), 140 nmol 25(OH)D/L could be regarded as a very conserv-
ative  limit  for  the  NOAEL  because  the  concentrations  in  those
reports  were  higher  than  this.  In  the  absence  of  sunshine, all
available  evidence  indicates  that  this  would  require  prolonged
intake of <250 mg (10 000 IU)/d to achieve. All of the reports of
vitamin  D  toxicity  showing  the  convincing  evidence  of  hyper-
calcemia involve serum 25(OH)D concentrations well above 200
nmol/L  (Table  5), which  requires  a  daily  intake  of  ‡ 1000 mg
(40 000 IU), and which could thus be conservatively considered
the LOAEL.

The  current  adult  DRI  for  vitamin  D  approximates  half  the
amount in the teaspoon of cod-liver oil that was a 19th-century
folk remedy. Today, new drugs are passed through dose-finding
studies  before  their  efficacy  is  evaluated  in  clinical  trials. This
principle is not strictly applicable to nutrient recommendations
because  the  bulk  of  what  humans  consume  of  them  is  from
unfortified  foods  and  this  consumption  is  what  recommended
intakes tend to match. In contrast, vitamin D is a special case; the
bulk of our dietary vitamin D intake is determined by legislation.
I contend that this practice amounts to the dosing of populations
with a drug, vitamin D, that is not present in the foods humans
normally consume. If vitamin D is similar to a drug, then dose-
finding studies are needed to use it properly, especially if non-
classical  benefits  are  potentially  relevant.  Alternatively, if  by
analogy  with  other  nutrients, vitamin  D  supplementation  is
intended  to  make  up  for  what  some  people  may  not  be  getting
from its natural source, in this case the sun, then the current adult
DRI of 5 mg (200 IU)/d is woefully inadequate.

This work is dedicated to my retired teachers, particularly Donald Fraser
and Sang-Whay Kooh, for the pleasurable times we shared trying to under-
stand the vitamin D system. I also thank Fraser for his thoughtful review of
this manuscript.
