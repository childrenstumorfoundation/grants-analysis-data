Background. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder, resulting in a variety of neural tumors, with
bilateral vestibular schwannomas as the most frequent manifestation. Recently, merlin, the NF2 tumor suppressor, has been identiﬁed as
a novel negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1); functional loss of merlin was shown to result in
elevated mTORC1 signaling in NF2-related tumors. Thus, mTORC1 pathway inhibition may be a useful targeted therapeutic approach.
Methods. We studied in vitro cell models, cohorts of mice allografted with Nf22/2 Schwann cells, and a genetically modiﬁed mouse model
of NF2 schwannoma in order to evaluate the efﬁcacy of the proposed targeted therapy for NF2.

Results. We found that treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin reduced the severity of NF2-related Schwann cell tumorigenesis
without signiﬁcant toxicity. Consistent with these results, in an NF2 patient with growing vestibular schwannomas, the rapalog sirolimus
induced tumor growth arrest.

Conclusions. Taken together, these results constitute deﬁnitive evidence that justiﬁes proceeding with clinical trials using mTORC1-
targeted agents in selected patients with NF2 and in patients with NF2-related sporadic tumors.

Keywords: neuroﬁbromatosis type 2, rapamycin, schwannoma.

Schwannomas are common benign tumors originating from
Schwann cells of peripheral or cranial nerves. Vestibular schwanno-
mas (VSs), previously known as acoustic neuromas, develop late in
life and account for 9% of intracranial tumors in humans.1 By con-
trast, patients with the tumor predisposition syndrome neuro-
ﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) develop multiple schwannomas early
in life, including bilateral VS, the hallmark of the disease.2 The
intractable location of these tumors renders treatment difﬁcult;
the primary treatment modality is surgical resection or, increasing-
ly, radiosurgery, with the associated risk of neurological deﬁcits.
Moreover, because of the genetic basis, NF2-related tumors often
recur, urgently necessitating the development of safe pharmaco-
logic therapies for long-term tumor control in these patients.3

Biallelic inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene is found
in nearly all sporadic schwannomas regardless of their location.4
Moreover, NF2 patients harbor germline heterozygous mutations
in the NF2 gene, and the related tumors exhibit additional loss or
mutation of the remaining wild-type NF2 allele. Thus, loss of func-
tion of the NF2-encoded protein, merlin/schwannomin, drives the
initiation of essentially all schwannomas.5

Merlin is suggested to control cell proliferation by mediating
contact inhibition of growth through mechanisms that include
formation of stable adherens junctions and promoting efﬁcient
expression, activity, and transport of speciﬁc growth factor recep-
tors.6 Consequently, merlin loss activates numerous mitogenic
pathways, including Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, Rac,

phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Hippo/Mst1, as well as E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity in different cell types.7

Recently, merlin has been identiﬁed as a novel negative regula-
tor of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1); func-
tional loss of merlin was shown to result in elevated mTORC1
signaling in NF2-related tumors.8 In addition, merlin-null mesothe-
liomas display deregulated mTORC1 signaling and are sensitive to
rapamycin treatment.9 Mammalian target of rapamycin is a ubi-
quitous protein kinase involved in several physiological processes,
including cell survival, growth, proliferation, metabolism, and
brain-speciﬁc functions, such as synaptic plasticity and cortical de-
velopment.10 Activation of the mTORC1 pathway has also emerged
as a conserved regulatory mechanism in the control of cell size.11
Dysregulation of the mTOR pathway has been implicated in pro-
moting a variety of pathological conditions, such as the tuberous
sclerosis complex (TSC), perhaps the most studied example of a
disease involving abnormal mTOR signaling. Mutation of either
the TSC1 or TSC2 gene leads to abnormal activation of the mTOR
pathway, resulting in increased cell growth and proliferation,
promoting tumorigenesis in TSC patients.12 Of direct translational
relevance, clinical trials have shown that mTORC1 inhibitors can
decrease growth of various tumors in TSC patients.13 In fact, the
mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus was recently approved by the FDA
for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas in
TSC patients.14

Rapamycin (sirolimus) and rapalogs (the rapamycin analogs
temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus) are speciﬁc inhibitors
of mTORC1. It remains unknown how rapamycin blocks mTORC1
activity, as it does not affect complex formation or autophosphor-
ylation of mTORC1; however, it may affect the afﬁnity of raptor
interaction with the complex.15 Recent reports suggest that
prolonged treatment with rapamycin causes disintegration of
mTORC1.16 Although rapamycin inhibits primarily mTORC1 and
not mTORC2, prolonged treatment of rapamycin can also inhibit
mTORC2 by blocking its assembly and causing disintegration of
mTORC2.17,18 Unlike rapamycin and rapalogs, mTOR kinase inhibi-
tors, the second generation of mTOR inhibitors is known as
ATP competitive.19 These mTORC1/mTORC2 dual
inhibitors are
designed to compete with ATP in the catalytic site of mTOR. Like
rapalogs, they decrease protein translation, attenuate cell cycle
progression, and inhibit angiogenesis in many cancer cell lines
and in human cancer.

Similar to TSC proteins, merlin negatively regulates mTORC1 and
positively regulates mTORC2. However, contrary to the activation
of mTORC1 signaling, the attenuated mTORC2 signaling proﬁles
in normal arachnoid and Schwann cells upon acute merlin loss
are not consistently reﬂected in NF2-deﬁcient meningiomas and
schwannomas, suggesting that additional genetic events may be
inconsistently acquired after initial merlin loss in these tumors.20
Since mTORC1 activation underlies the aberrant growth and prolif-
eration of NF2-associated tumors and may restrain the growth
of these lesions through negative feedback mechanisms, we
hypothesized that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1,19 may be
therapeutic for NF2.

Here, we show that rapamycin induced schwannoma growth
delay in 3 complementary NF2 schwannoma mouse models.
Moreover, in an NF2 patient with fast-growing VS, prolonged treat-
ment with sirolimus inhibited tumor growth. Our ﬁndings provide
evidence that mTOR inhibition should be explored in clinical trials
for NF2-related schwannoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell Viability and Proliferation Assay
An ATP-based monolayer cell proliferation assay (Promega) and soft agar
clonogenic assay were used to test cell viability and proliferation at 72 h
and at 3 weeks, respectively, of drug administration in vitro. The drug con-
centration that inhibits cell growth by 50% (IC50) was determined using
GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Details are in the Supplementary material.

Cell Size Analysis
Relative size of SC-FC912 cells (adult NF2-deﬁcient mouse Schwann cells)
with or without rapamycin treatment was obtained by ﬂuorescence-
activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis (FACSAria, Becton Dickinson) using
forward scatter-height (FSC-H). Cells were treated with 20 nM or 20 mM of
rapamycin every day for 4 days. Cells were trypsinized, ﬁxed with ethyl
alcohol 70%, and incubated with RNase (100 mg/mL) and propidium
iodide (5 mg/mL). A total of 20 000 cells were collected, and the mean
FSC-H value of the G1-phase cell population was obtained from FACSDiva
software as a measure of relative cell size (6000–12 000 cells). A cell
count graph was realized with FlowJo software.

Cell Surface Area Measurements
Human schwannoma cell primary cultures were freshly prepared from sur-
gical samples. After incubation for 1–5 days in Proliferation Medium (PM)
(Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum [Invitro-
gen], 1% N2 supplement, 10 ng/mL neuregulin-1 and 2 mM forskolin,
50 mg/mL gentamycin, and 1% Fungizone), tissues were dissociated for
4 h or overnight with 0.05% collagenase type I (Invitrogen) and 1.25 U/mL
dispase (Roche). Cells were plated in 12- or 24-well plates coated with
poly-L-lysine (Sigma)/laminin (Invitrogen) and cultured at 378C in 7.5%
CO2. Cells were plated at 1000 or 2000 per well and used between passages
2 and 4. Rapamycin was added at the different concentrations 4–5 days
after plating, and medium was then changed with new drug every other
day for 12–20 days. Cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
stained with anti-S100 protein (Dako Z0311), followed by Al594-conju-
gated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Life Technologies) and counter-
stained with Hoechst 33258 (Life Technologies). Cell surface areas were
determined using the automated Celigo Cell Cytometer (Brooks Life
Science Systems). An average of 450 (min 328, max 580) or 900 (min
655, max 1130) cells were quantiﬁed per well of 12- or 24-well plates,
respectively.

Western Blot and ELISA
Tumor specimens of vehicle- or rapamycin-treated mice were snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2808C. Pulverized frozen tumor samples
were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and the total
proteins were extracted, separated, and transferred using standard proce-
dures. Antibodies used for western blotting are in Supplementary material.
Levels of S6, phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), Akt, phospho-Akt1 (Ser473),
phospho–4E-BP1 (Thr37/Thr46), and alpha-tubulin were determined
using the PathScan Cell Growth Multi-Target Sandwich ELISA Kit (Cell Signal-
ing Technology) following the manufacturer’s recommendation.

cells and the transplantable schwannoma homogenate, 08031-9, were
grafted in nu/nu and in Friend virus B (FVB)/N syngeneic mice, respectively.
Details and morphometric analysis of intratumoral vasculature are in
Supporting Information.

Compound and Administration
Aliquots containing 20 mg/mL rapamycin diluted in ethanol were prepared
weekly and stored at 2208C. Each aliquot was then diluted in vehicle (0.25%
polyethylene glycol 400, 0.25% Tween 80, H2O) ,1 h before use, to obtain a
ﬁnal dosing of 10 mg/kg/day. Rapamycin treatment was dosed 8 mg/kg/
day and administered by intraperitoneal injection following a schedule of
once a day, 5 of 7 days for the ESC-FC1801 xenografts (14 d treatment),
08031-9 syngrafts (36 d treatment followed by 14 d withdrawal for 3
mice), and P0-SCH-D(39-121)-27 transgenic mice during the ﬁrst 2
months of treatment. In the latter model, following this initial regimen,
rapamycin was then dosed 16 mg/kg weekly during 8.5 months, followed
by the original regimen for the last 1.5 months (1 y of treatment). A
regimen including daily administration 7 of 7 days was used for the SC4-9
intraneural orthotopic xenograft experiment (15 d of treatment). For
SC4-9 grafts, tumor volumes were calipered and body weight was mea-
sured during the course of the experiment. Treatment was stopped at
day 36 because the mean tumor volume of the control group reached
the IACUC approved volume. At that time, tumors were dissected for
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis
The concentration of rapamycin in plasma and tumors was measured
following single dose and repeated dose administration. The assay was
performed by Rocky Mountain Instrumental Laboratories. Details are in
the Supplementary material.

Morphometric Analysis of Schwann Cell Tumorlets in NF2
Transgenic Mice
P0-SCH-D(39–121)-27 transgenic mice in the FVB/N background21 were
bred to wild-type C3H mice to generate (FVB/NCrlxC3H/HeNCrl)F1. Mice
were randomized to receive rapamycin or vehicle at 6 weeks of age, corre-
sponding to the time of tumor induction in this model. The development of
Schwann cell tumorlets in the spinal nerve roots was histopathologically
scored at the endpoint and compared between drug-treated and vehicle-
treated mice. Details are in Supporting Information.

Immunohistochemical Analysis
Three-micrometer-thick formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded sections were
immunostained following manufacturers’ recommendations and standard
protocols with antibodies against the following antigens: phospho-S6
(1:1000 or 1:200; #2211, Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-Akt (1:100;
#4060, Cell Signaling Technology), CD31 (1:750; sc-1506, Santa Cruz Bio-
technology), hypoxia-inducible factor–1a (sc-10790, Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology), and LC3 (NBP1-19167, Novus Biologicals). To assess cell
proliferation, we used bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; Invitrogen) labeling of
cells in S phase of the cell cycle. Bromodeoxyuridine (50 mg/g body
weight) was administrated 4 h before harvesting tissues for xenograft
experiments or 3 times at 3-h intervals (24, 21, and 18 h) before dissection
for the P0-SCH-D(39-121)-27 transgenic mice. Incorporation of BrdU was
then revealed following manufacturer recommendations (BrdU Staining
Kit, Invitrogen). Apoptosis was monitored on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-
embedded sections using the DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL System
(Promega) following manufacturer recommendations.

Data Analysis
For measurements, data are expressed as mean+SEM. For statistical com-
parison at the endpoint, we used either a Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney
test when appropriate (2-tailed for unequal variance). For longitudinal
follow-up of tumor growth in the subcutaneous graft models or mice
weight, we used a nonparametric Wilcoxon test (2-tailed for unequal vari-
ance). For all tests, the level of signiﬁcance was set at P , .05 (2-tailed),
P values: *,.05, **,.01, ***,.001. Statistical calculations were done
using GraphPad Prism 5.0a. For comparison of tumor response in the
P0-SCH-D(39-121) transgenic mice and to handle dependencies between
observations we used a multilevel analysis (SPSS 18.0). A Kaplan–Meier
curve and a log-rank test were used to compare the delay before occurrence
of a severe paralysis in the intraneural orthotopic model (GraphPad Prism
5.0a).

Human Subjects
Informed consent was obtained from the subject, and the experiments
conformed to the principles set out in the World Medical Association’s Dec-
laration of Helsinki (http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/)
and the NIH Belmont Report (http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.
html).

Volumetric Tumor Monitoring
Tumor volumes were calculated on 3D T1 gadolinium-enhanced MRI
sequences (slice thickness, 1 mm, no skip) by manual segmentation with
OsiriX 4.0 software (Pixmeo). Using ITK SNAP 2.4.0 software, the volume
of the cystic components was calculated on 3D T1 gadolinium-enhanced
sequences by user-guided 3D active contour segmentation.22

Results
Merlin-deﬁcient Schwannoma Cell Lines Are Sensitive
to Rapamycin
NF2 inactivation results in the aberrant activation of the mTOR
pathway, raising the possibility that growth and survival of
NF2-associated tumors may be dependent on increased mTOR sig-
naling.8,9,23,24 To test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst examined the effects
of rapamycin on human and murine merlin-deﬁcient schwannoma
cell lines. The proliferation of mouse schwannoma cells (08031-9)
was potently inhibited by low doses of rapamycin, with IC50 values
,0.1 nM. Long-term effect of rapamycin in merlin-deﬁcient cells in
vitro was evaluated by soft agar clonogenic assay. Because of their
benign nature, primary cultures of schwannoma cells do not form
colonies in this assay and were therefore excluded from the
analysis. Soft agar clonogenic assays using 3 immortalized cell
lines—Nf22/2 mouse Schwann cells (ESC-FC1801) and mouse
(08031-9) and human (HEI193) schwannoma cells—showed
signiﬁcant reduction in the number of anchorage-independent col-
onies, in a dose-dependent manner, in all cell lines (Fig. 1A and B).
Signiﬁcant reduction was evidenced at 1 nM rapamycin exposure
for 21 days, compared with the vehicle-treated control (P ,
.001). There was no statistical difference between the 1 and
100 nmol/L rapamycin doses in terms of colony numbers. As pre-
dicted from previous studies showing that rapalogs are cytostatic,
not cytotoxic, colony growth resumed upon rapamycin withdraw-
al, and the number of colonies was not signiﬁcantly different from
that in the vehicle-treated control after an additional 21 days of
withdrawal (Fig. 1A and B). Consistent with these results, we also

found that rapamycin functions by triggering growth arrest of
schwannoma cells rather than apoptosis measured in vitro using
a caspase activity assay (not shown). To clarify the underlying
mechanisms that control this antiproliferative effect, we treated
08031-9 cells with rapamycin for 24 h and then monitored phos-
phorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 in cell
lysates by western blot
(Fig. 1C). As expected, rapamycin blocked the phosphorylation of
S6 and decreased the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, whereas
vehicle had no effect. As Akt phosphorylation can be secondarily
upregulated following mTOR inhibition, we tested whether the
phosphorylation of Akt was altered in response to rapamycin. No
increase in phospho-Akt was observed in 08031-9 cells treated
with rapamycin, at least at this start time.

Primary cells of human merlin-deﬁcient schwannoma and
meningioma exhibit an enlarged-cell phenotype compared with
nonneoplastic cell counterparts,8,23,24 and exposure to rapamycin
has been shown to revert them to this phenotype in meningioma
cells.8 An analysis of relative cell sizes by ﬂow cytometry demon-
strated that Nf22/2 mouse Schwann cells that were actively
dividing and had been treated with rapamycin for 4 days were
strikingly smaller in size compared with nontreated cells, as indi-
cated by a decreased FSC-H mean (Fig. 1D and E). Similarly,
primary cells from human vestibular schwannomas treated
with rapamycin for 12–20 days demonstrated a reduced cell
surface area compared with nontreated cells (Fig. 1F and G).
These ﬁndings indicate that as in meningioma cells, inhibition
of mTORC1 by rapamycin also reduces the size of merlin-deﬁcient
schwannoma cells.

In vivo Response to Rapamycin Treatment in Mice
To test the requirement for mTOR in NF2 tumorigenesis in vivo and
to assess the preclinical therapeutic efﬁcacy of rapamycin, we used
3 mouse models of Nf2-mutant schwannoma.

First, we used 2 allograft models as relatively high throughput
preclinical evaluation systems relevant to NF2-related schwanno-
mas. In one model, orthotopic grafts were generated by injecting
Nf22/2 mouse Schwann cells, SC4-9, into the sciatic nerves of
nu/nu mice. The other is a syngeneic, transplantable subcutaneous
allograft model derived from a schwannoma (08031-9) that arose
spontaneously in a transgenic P0-SCH-D(39-121)-27 mouse.

For the third model, we used a genetically engineered mouse
NF2 model: the transgenic P0-SCH-D(39-121)-27 mice, which
express a dominant-negative human merlin mutant protein in
Schwann cells, resulting in functional inactivation of endogenous
merlin. This model features schwannosis (Schwann cell hyper-
plasia and tumorlets) and frank schwannomas that develop pri-
marily within the spinal roots and other peripheral nerves.21,25,26
The rapid development of endogenous lesions and their predict-
able progression represent a powerful model for preclinical drug
testing for NF2.

Daily administration of rapamycin at 8 mg/kg/day was well tol-
erated with no signiﬁcant weight loss in any animals tested in this
study (not shown). Since the standard rapamycin dosing regimen
in humans is 3–20 ng/mL, the dose used in our study was relevant
to rapamycin treatment in humans.27 In the 2 allograft NF2 models
(Figs. 2A and 3A), rapamycin potently suppressed merlin-deﬁcient
tumor growth (Fig. 2B and C and Fig. 3C and D), with a signiﬁcant
cytostatic effect demonstrated by a reduced number of BrdU-
positive cells (Figs. 2E and 3G) and no change in apoptosis (not

shown). In addition, rapamycin exposure delayed onset and
reduced the penetrance of severe hind-limb paralysis, an addition-
al functional preclinical endpoint in the sciatic allograft model
(Fig. 2D). The concentration of rapamycin in the 08031-9 tumors
after repeated administration reached above 200 ng/mg, a dose
equivalent to (cid:2)220 nM in vitro (Fig. 3B).

Inhibition of S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was observed in
treated tumors, demonstrating that rapamycin effectively sup-
pressed the mTOR pathway in vivo (Fig. 2G and H and Fig. 3E
and H). Tumor growth inhibition was dependent on continuous
exposure to rapamycin, as after rapamycin withdrawal tumors
reexhibited S6 phosphorylation and resumed growth at a faster
rate than vehicle-treated tumors (Fig. 3C, E, H). As Akt phosphor-
ylation can be upregulated following mTOR inhibition,28 we tested
whether the phosphorylation of Akt was altered in response to
rapamycin. A small
increase in phospho-Akt was observed in
tumor samples treated with rapamycin compared with vehicle-
treated tumors (Figs. 2I and 3I). Taken together, these data dem-
onstrate that merlin-deﬁcient tumors can be almost completely
contained by a continuous treatment with an mTOR inhibitor.
The enhanced in vivo effect of
rapamycin correlated with
decreased vascularization of the tumors (Fig. 2F and Fig. 3F and J),
suggesting that rapamycin effects may be at least in part
mediated via effects on the vasculature. The rebound effect of
rapamycin in the mouse schwannoma is similar to the transient
response to RAD001 observed in malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumor, hemangiosarcoma, or glioblastoma xenograft
models.29,30

Next, we utilized the genetically engineered mouse model of
NF2-related schwannoma. P0-SCH-D(39-121)-27 transgenic
mice in the (FVB/NCrlxC3H/HeNCrl)F1 background were rando-
mized to receive either rapamycin (8 mg/kg/d) or vehicle, 5 days
per week. Treatment was started when mice were 6 weeks old
and continued for 8 weeks (Fig. 4A). The efﬁcacy of rapamycin
treatment in this model was assessed by comparing the tumor
burden, as deﬁned by the ratio of tumoral versus normal nerve in
the spinal roots (Fig. 4B). The mean percentage of tumor area/
total root area in the rapamycin-treated group was 4.4% and in
the vehicle-treated group 16.8% (Fig. 4E). This 75% decrease of
the tumor load was statistically highly signiﬁcant (P , .001, multi-
level analysis; SPSS). To monitor the effect of rapamycin on the
mTOR targets S6K and 4E-BP1 in this model, we treated 4 mice
with rapamycin and 4 mice with vehicle during 7 days. The spinal
nerves containing the tumors were dissected and analyzed by
western blot (Fig. 4C), which showed a strong reduction of S6 and
4E-BP1 phosphorylation. We also observed a slight increase of
Akt phosphorylation in treated mice (Fig. 4C). Finally, we examined
the efﬁcacy of a prolonged maintenance dose of rapamycin over a
course of 12 months using a similar schedule previously reported in
a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis.27 Nine mice at 6 weeks of age
were assigned to rapamycin treatment, while 7 mice received
vehicle as control. After 2 months of daily administration of rapa-
mycin (8 mg/kg/d, 5 d/wk), treatment was continued weekly for
9 months (16 mg/kg/d, 1 d/wk), and then daily for 1.5 months
(8 mg/kg/d, 5 d/wk) (Fig. 4A). We observed a 40% reduction in
Schwann cell tumors in drug-treated mice (Fig. 4E). Remarkably,
rapamycin treatment delayed tumor growth by 7 months over
the course of the 12-month treatment (Fig. 4D), and treatment
was well tolerated. However, 3 female mice in the rapamycin-
treated arm were euthanized because of uterus tumors, previously

Fig. 2. Rapamycin rapidly inhibited tumor growth and improved functional outcomes in an orthotopic NF2 mouse schwannoma allograft model. (A) Nu/nu
mice were implanted with adult mouse Nf22/2 Schwann cells 1 week before randomization. Mice were treated daily with rapamycin (8 mg/kg/d, i.p.)
(n ¼ 20) or vehicle (n ¼ 15) for 14 days. (B and C) Rapamycin treatment reduced the growth of intraneural Nf22/2 Schwann cell allografts by 4-fold
compared with vehicle-treated controls (P ¼ .001 at day 22) and (D) signiﬁcantly delayed the onset of severe hind-limb paralysis. (E and F) Rapamycin
treatment reduced the number of BrdU-positive cells (E) and microvascular density (F) in tumors. (G–I) Quantiﬁcation of absorbance for phospho-S6
protein normalized to total S6 by ELISA demonstrated decreased phosphorylation at 1 h, 6 h, and 16 h following i.p. administration of 8 mg/kg/d

cell tumor growth in this model (blue curve in Fig. 4D), we deﬁned
histopathological progression as a tumor area/total nerve area of
25%, resulting in 7 months of time to tumor progression in untreat-
ed mice. Based on this deﬁnition, a 2-fold increase of time to tumor
progression was achieved in the rapamycin arm.

8 mg/kg/d for 5/7 days per week for 36 days. For 3 mice, treatment was discontinued for 14 days before sacriﬁce. (B) Pharmacokinetic analysis of
rapamycin-treated mice showed that rapamycin concentration levels in tumors reached levels consistent with activity in vitro. (C) Rapamycin potently
suppressed schwannoma growth, showing potent cytostatic effects (P ¼ .0004 at the endpoint, Mann–Whitney test). Three mice in the treated group
were kept without treatment to evaluate the effect of rapamycin withdrawal on tumor growth, showing that rapamycin-induced inhibition of tumor
cell proliferation was reversible. (D) After 36 days of treatment, the rapamycin-treated group demonstrated reduction in tumor volume .5-fold
compared with controls (P , .001, t-test).
(E–J) Rapamycin treatment inhibited mTOR activity and activated Akt. (E) Phospho-S6 protein
immunohistochemistry in vehicle- and rapamycin-treated tumors showed decreased phosphorylation at 1 h after rapamycin administration. (F) CD31
immunohistochemistry highlights abnormal vascular morphology and increased vessel diameter in the vehicle and withdrawal groups. Tumor vessel
morphology was improved in the rapamycin-treated group. (G) Quantiﬁcation of BrdU incorporation demonstrated signiﬁcant reduction of proliferating
tumor cells following rapamycin treatment (P ¼ .0018 vs vehicle). Fourteen days after treatment withdrawal, the proliferating index regained the
control level. (H) Quantiﬁcation of absorbance for phospho-S6 protein normalized to total S6 by ELISA showed decreased phosphorylation at 1 h, 6 h,
and 16 h. Maximum inhibition was observed at the 6-h time point. (I) As a result of mTOR inhibition, densitometry-quantiﬁed levels of phospho-Akt
normalized to total Akt showed activation 1 h after the last rapamycin dose. (J) Quantiﬁcation of intratumoral vascular density (iMVD) evaluated in
vehicle (n ¼ 6),
(n ¼ 3) groups demonstrated a signiﬁcantly decreased iMVD in the treated group
(P ¼ .012 vs vehicle). Increased iMVD was observed after drug withdrawal (P ¼ ns vs vehicle).

patient had had a diagnosis of NF2 at age 10 due to unilateral
hearing loss. MRI revealed bilateral VSs, several cranial meningi-
omas,
lower cranial nerve schwannomas, and spinal tumors
including ependymomas. He harbored a stop mutation in exon 4
of NF2 on blood test (c.373C . T) and was the only affected
member of his family. As a result of spinal tumors, brachial
plexus schwannomas, and peripheral neuropathy, he had a com-
plete paralysis and amyotrophy of his left upper limb. At age 15,
he became deaf on the right side, and his 15-mm right VS was irra-
diated by gamma knife. He became deaf on the left side at age 19,
and the left VS was removed at age 24 because of progressive
enlargement. Insertion of an auditory brainstem implant failed
because of cerebellum edema. He developed efﬁcient lip reading
and lived an independent life, working as a pharmacist. Despite
gamma knife treatment, the left VS grew regularly at a mean
rate of 47% per year in volume between ages 26 and 30, reaching
24.9 cm3. At age 29, right-hand paresis progressively occurred,
associated with an increase in size of a huge tumor invading all
the branches of the brachial plexus. Surgical removal of this
tumor was not possible.

Thus, in 2009, at age 30, sirolimus (Rapamune, Pﬁzer) was intro-
duced on a compassionate use basis. Oral doses were gradually
increased from 0.4 mg to 6 mg a day, and sirolimus trough levels
steadily reached 17 ng/mL (Fig. 5A). Follow-up included clinical
examination, blood tests, and MRI. The patient has now been
under sirolimus for 4.5 years, without noticeable secondary event
(grade 1 diarrhea according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events v3.0). A decrease in VS growth rate was
obvious (Fig. 5A and B), from 47% per year (from 9.1 to 24.9 cm3
in 3.7 y) before treatment to 5.2% per year (from 24.9 to
27.7 cm3 in 2.1 y). We even observed a decrease in VS volume
from 28.8 to 27.7 cm3 (23.8%), during a 5-month period
(28.8%/y), corresponding to the highest dose period (5 to 6 mg/d,
blood levels 16–27 ng/mL). Of note, other cranial schwannomas
and meningiomas remained stable during follow-up, except 1
meningioma (grade II) on the anterior skull base that enlarged
with progressive vision loss and was removed at age 32. Sirolimus
was discontinued for a 2.5-month period encompassing the surgi-
cal procedure. We observed an increase in VS growth rate, which
reached 22% per year during this period (from 27.7 to 29.7 cm3
in a 4-mo interval between MRIs). Reintroduction of sirolimus at
4 mg a day (plasma levels 16–17 ng/mL) led to a new decrease
in VS growth rate to 3.5% per year (from 29.7 to 31.9 cm3 in 2 y)
(Fig. 5A). A 20% variation in tumor volume is usually used as an
endpoint in NF2 trials.35 In this patient, the times needed for a
20% increase of tumor volume were 9 months before sirolimus
treatment and 30.5 months after sirolimus onset. Thus, we
observed a 3.4-fold increase in time to tumor progression under
sirolimus therapy. Of note, the brachial plexus schwannoma
remained stable, although precise volume evaluation was not
performed because of the involvement of several branches of the
brachial plexus. Clinically, a stabilization of the right-hand paresis
was noticed. We also noticed cystic changes of VS during sirolimus

treatment: at treatment onset, scarce patchy cystic areas were
visible on MRI. The cystic component of VS reached 10.3% of
tumor volume at last follow-up (Fig. 5B). These cystic modiﬁcations
or loss of contrast enhancement are observed frequently after
radiosurgery and are considered a good prognostic indicator of
tumor regression.31 These changes could also reﬂect the response
to sirolimus, similarly to what is described in response to targeted
therapies that do not induce frank tumor shrinkage, despite
improved patient outcome.32 Although reﬂecting the course of a
single patient, this clinical outcome is remarkably consistent with
the preclinical studies in NF2 mice described above. Altogether,
our results indicate that prolonged treatment with low doses of
mTORC1 pathway inhibitors may result in long-term stabilization
of growing NF2-related schwannomas and strongly support the
evaluation of this strategy in clinical trials.

Discussion
NF2 is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by
inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene NF2.33 Interestingly,
though NF2 affects only 1:33 000 persons with a prevalence of
5466 affected people alive in the United States,34 population
studies suggest that up to 1:300 people will develop a tumor
with an underlying sporadic NF2 mutation in their lifetime.35 NF2
represents a difﬁcult management problem, with most patients
facing substantial morbidity and reduced life expectancy.36 Until
recently there were few pharmacologic options for individuals
with NF2. With increasing understanding of the genetic basis of
the disease, as well as emerging molecular parallels with various
cancers for which drug therapies are in development or already
clinically available, therapeutic development for NF2 is also pro-
gressing. Nevertheless, challenges lie ahead for NF2, including
the deﬁnition of functional endpoints for clinical evaluation
strategies.

Time to tumor progression as an endpoint has not yet been used
for NF2 VS studies, although in the case of these slow-growing, in-
dolent tumors, delaying progression would be a highly desirable
outcome, especially if accompanied by acceptable hearing and
neurologic performance with good quality of life. Our preclinical
study in a genetically engineered mouse NF2 model, which recapi-
tulates schwannoma natural history, demonstrated that rapamy-
cin signiﬁcantly increased time to tumor progression and was well
tolerated over an extended period of time. In addition, grafted
tumor regrowth was observed upon cessation of therapy, consist-
ent with the known cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects of rapa-
mycin. Our ﬁndings show that rapamycin alone limits but does not
suppress tumorigenesis, as observed in mouse models of tuberous
sclerosis. Blocking mTORC1 signaling with rapamycin also results in
elevated phospho-Akt.28 As Akt is a progrowth, prosurvival mol-
ecule, this feedback loop must be considered when treating NF2
tumors with rapamycin. Whether rapamycin treatment would be
effective only in NF2 tumors or equally effective in sporadic
schwannomas and meningiomas with NF2 mutations is not

known. Recently, mTORC1 inhibition has been shown to suppress
meningioma growth in mouse xenograft models, and increased
Akt phosphorylation was observed in the treatment group.37
Since Akt activation in meningiomas has been associated with
higher grades, the feedback activation of Akt upon mTORC1 inhib-
ition should be particularly considered when treating these
tumors.38

The in vivo effect of rapamycin correlated with decreased perfu-
sion of the tumors, suggesting that rapamycin effects may be at
least in part mediated via effects on the vasculature. In NF2
patients, hearing decline is signiﬁcantly more common with active-
ly growing tumors,39 thus stabilization of tumor growth could also
result in hearing preservation. The mTOR pathway has been impli-
cated in the regulation of tumor production of proangiogenic
factors as well as modulation of vascular endothelial growth

factor receptor signaling in endothelial cells. Encouraging results
have been reported with bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech), a
humanized monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endo-
thelial growth factor, in treating NF2 patients on a compassionate
use basis. About 40% of NF2 patients achieved hearing improve-
ment while on bevacizumab.40,41

The predictive power of our preclinical studies was corroborated
by the clinical observation in the index patient, where the early
transient tumor stabilization could also be explained by the rapid
cell size reduction of NF2-deﬁcient schwannoma cells in response
to rapamycin, followed by progressive reduction of growth rate
mirroring sirolimus blood concentrations. Moreover, rapid tumor
volumetric growth following transient sirolimus withdrawal likely
reﬂects a sudden increase in cell size, accompanied by cell cycle
reentry and cell proliferation. Finally, upon reintroduction of

sirolimus, stabilization was immediately resumed, indicating that
inhibition of mTORC1 had a direct inhibitory effect on VS growth,
which therefore cannot be ascribed to the saltatory progression
pattern described in the natural history of a rare subset of
VS.39,42 The observation that in this patient, a rapidly growing
grade II meningioma did not respond to sirolimus therapy is
likely explained by the fact that higher-grade meningiomas in
NF2 patients carry chromosomal instability.43 This can result in
aberrant expression of cellular proliferative genes and silencing of
other tumor suppressor genes, which can effectively modulate
NF2-deﬁcient tumor cell response to sirolimus.

Thus, the NF2 genetically engineered mouse schwannoma
model appears to be predictive of treatment outcomes and
strongly supports the application of the co-clinical trial concept
in which mouse and human trials are conducted in parallel.44 – 46
The encouraging and consistent result in an index patient, to-
gether with the preclinical results in mice, has now prompted
phase II clinical trials to determine the efﬁcacy of the rapalog
everolimus for growing NF2 VS (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01490476,
NCT01345136, NCT01419639). The real challenge in the years
to come will be to use targeted therapeutic modalities for effect-
ive NF2 tumor chemoprevention commensurate with an accurate
estimate of drug safety and tolerability. This can be addressed by
long-term treatment in genetically engineered mouse models
and by clinical observations in cognate disease resulting in NF2
drug repurposing.
