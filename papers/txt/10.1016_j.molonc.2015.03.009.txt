Vestibular schwannomas (VSs), the most common tumors of the cerebellopontine angle,
arise from Schwann cells lining the vestibular nerve. Pharmacotherapies against VS are
almost non-existent. Although the therapeutic inhibition of inﬂammatory modulators
has been established for other neoplasms, it has not been explored in VS. A bioinformatic
network analysis of all genes reported to be differentially expressed in human VS revealed
a pro-inﬂammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) as a central mole-
cule in VS pathobiology. Assessed at the transcriptional and translational level, canonical
NF-kB complex was aberrantly activated in human VS and derived VS cultures in compar-
ison to control nerves and Schwann cells, respectively. Cultured primary VS cells and VS-
derived human cell line HEI-193 were treated with speciﬁc NF-kB siRNAs, experimental NF-
kB inhibitor BAY11-7082 (BAY11) and clinically relevant NF-kB inhibitor curcumin. Healthy
human control Schwann cells from the great auricular nerve were also treated with BAY11
and curcumin to assess toxicity. All three treatments signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation in
primary VS cultures and HEI-193 cells, with siRNA, 5 mM BAY11 and 50 mM curcumin
reducing average proliferation (standard error of mean)
to 62.33%  10.59%,
14.3  9.7%, and 23.0  20.9% of control primary VS cells, respectively. These treatments
also induced substantial cell death. Curcumin, unlike BAY11, also affected primary
Schwann cells. This work highlights NF-kB as a key modulator in VS cell proliferation
and survival and demonstrates therapeutic efﬁcacy of directly targeting NF-kB in VS.

Introduction

surgical

resection and stereotactic

Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are the fourth most common
intracranial tumors (Mahaley et al., 1990). Although histolog-
ically non-malignant, they can cause multiple cranial neu-
ropathies and even death due to their location in the
cerebellopontine angle and potential for brainstem compres-
sion. Currently, main treatment modalities for growing VSs
are
radiotherapy.
Although interest
in pharmacotherapies against VS is
increasing (Plotkin et al., 2012), none are FDA approved.
This is partially because drugs such as bevacizumab, which
shrink some VSs, have substantial side effects, including
renal
failure, which may outweigh potential beneﬁts
(Plotkin et al., 2012). Therefore, there is an unmet medical
need to establish well-tolerated pharmacotherapies to pre-
vent VS growth. Although much is known about the different
pathways implicated in VS pathobiology, the interconnec-
tedness among these pathways has not been studied
extensively.

To identify the major orchestrators of VS growth, we con-
ducted the ﬁrst comprehensive network analysis of the pub-
lished genes aberrantly expressed in sporadic VS. Nuclear
factor-kappa B (NF-kB), a transcription factor known for medi-
ating the physiological inﬂammatory response and pathologic
inﬂammation in several diseases, including neoplastic growth
(Hoesel and Schmid, 2013), was identiﬁed as a central factor in
a top-ranking network. Although NF-kB has been connected to
other molecules in VS, NF-kB activation and the accompa-
nying inﬂammation have not been directly explored as thera-
peutic targets against sporadic VS. However,
level of
inﬁltration of CD163þ tumor-associated macrophages, known
to pathologically promote tumor growth and survival, corre-
lates with human VS growth rate, motivating research to
investigate the inﬂammatory pathways that may promote
VS growth (de Vries et al., 2013).

NF-kB can regulate the transcription of over 300 down-
stream genes, resulting in differential
inﬂuences on cell
growth, proliferation and survival depending on the stimulus
(Gilmore, 2014). NF-kB’s therapeutic inhibition has been inves-
tigated in several cancers because of its role in pathological
inﬂammation accompanying neoplastic growth (Hoesel and
Schmid, 2013). NF-kB is especially relevant for VS since merlin,
the protein encoded by the NF2 gene, acts as a negative regu-
lator of the NF-kB pathway (Kim et al., 2002) and merlin is
dysfunctional in majority of VSs (Lee et al., 2012a,b). Addition-
ally, Axl, a member of the TAM family of receptor tyrosine ki-
nases, regulates overexpression of survivin and cyclin D1
through NF-kB,
leading to enhanced survival, cell-matrix
adhesion and proliferation of cultured VS cells (Ammoun
et al., 2013). NF-kB also regulates p75-associated VS prolifera-
tion and apoptosis (Ahmad et al., 2014).

We investigated NF-kB’s aberrance in human VS and the
therapeutic potential of NF-kB inhibition. Our results sug-
gest that the NF-kB pathway is aberrantly activated in VS
and VS-derived cultures compared to healthy nerves and
SCs, respectively. NF-kB inhibition in primary VS cells and
a VS-derived human cell line using NF-kB siRNA, an experi-
mental NF-kB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 (BAY11) and a clinically

relevant inhibitor curcumin decreased proliferation and
survival of the tumor cells. Our work provides novel insight
into NF-kB’s expression and role in VS pathobiology and
demonstrates therapeutic efﬁcacy of directly targeting NF-
kB in VS.

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis

assay,

enzyme-linked

immunosorbent

A literature search was performed with PubMed using MeSH
terms neuroma, acoustic, proteins, genes, gene expression,
gene expression regulation, gene expression proﬁling, micorar-
ray analysis, DNA mutational analysis, immunohistochem-
istry,
tumor
suppressor proteins, DNA and RNA. Only human studies with
relevant controls and explicit description of statistical criteria
were selected. Differentially expressed molecules were
analyzed on April 14th 2011 using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA, Ingenuity Systems, Inc.) version 9.0, while setting a cutoff
value to 2. Molecules reported to be up- or down-regulated
qualitatively were assigned a value 2 or  2, respectively. To
avoid a bias toward molecules with extreme differential
expression, the absolute maximal value for fold change was
set to 100 for molecules with a greater change. The maximal
number of molecules per network was 35. The most intercon-
nected molecule in each network is known as the hub.

2.2.

Specimen collection

Freshly harvested human specimens of sporadic VS and con-
trol great auricular nerve (GAN) were collected from indicated
surgeries, placed in saline and transported to the laboratory
on ice. The study protocols were approved by Human Studies
Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachu-
setts Eye and Ear Inﬁrmary, and conducted in accordance with
the Helsinki Declaration.

2.3.

Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction

Expression of genes in the NF-kB pathway was measured us-
ing real time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Human VS or GAN tis-
sue was placed in RNA Later (Qiagen) temporarily. RNA was
extracted using RNeasy Mini-Kit
(Qiagen) and reverse-
transcribed to cDNA with Taqman Reverse Transcription Re-
agent kit
(Applied Biosystems), as previously described
(Stankovic et al., 2009). qPCR was performed using Applied
Biosystems 7700 Sequence Detection System with TaqMan
Primers (Applied Biosystems) for NFKB1 (encoding p50 subunit
of the NF-kB heterodimer, Hs01042010_m1), RELA (encoding
p65 subunit of the NF-kB heterodimer required for activation,
Hs01042010_m1), TNF (encoding tumor necrosis factor, an
inducer for NF-kB, Hs01042010_m1), RANK (encoding receptor
activator of nuclear factor-kappa B, Hs00187192_m1), NFKB2

Protein extraction and quantiﬁcation



Translation and activation of the NF-kB pathway components
were investigated through western blot analysis. Total protein
was extracted on ice from freshly harvested specimens of VS
and GAN in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences). The lysate
was isolated by centrifugation and stored at  80
C. Equal pro-
tein was loaded per lane, separated on a 4e20% Tris-glycine
gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a Polyvinylidene ﬂuoride
membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked and
probed with Cell Signaling Technology antibodies against
NF-kB phosphorylated (P-) p65 (#3033), NF-kB p65 (#8242), in-
hibitor of kappa B alpha (IkBa, #11930) or NF-kB p50 (Abcam,
#ab7971), followed by secondary antibodies (Jackson-Immuno
Research). Membranes were visualized with ChemiDoc XRSþ
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). Band densities were quantiﬁed using
ImageJ and normalized to GAPDH expression (Cell Signaling
Technology, #5174).

2.5.

Immunohistochemistry

Human VS and GAN specimens were ﬁxed in 4% PFA, trans-
ferred to PBS, embedded in parafﬁn, sectioned, deparafﬁnized
with xylene, washed in PBS, permeabilized with Triton-X 100
(Integra) for 5 min, blocked in normal horse serum and incu-
bated with primary antibodies against S100 (Dako, #Z0311)
or p50 (Abcam, #ab7971) and corresponding ﬂuorescent sec-
ondary antibodies (Jackson-Immuno Research). Nuclei were
labeled with Hoechst stain (Invitrogen). The tissue was visual-
ized and imaged using Carl Zeiss 2000 upright microscope.

Using sterile technique, freshly harvested VS or GAN tissue
was rinsed in PBS, dissected in culture medium consisting of
Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s medium with Ham’s F12 mixture
(DMEM/F12), 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Penicillin/Strepto-
mycin (Pen/Strep) and 1% GlutaMAX, dissociated in Hyaluron-
idase and Collagenase (all from Life Technologies) overnight
and cultured for 2e4 weeks, as previously described (Dilwali
et al., 2014). Human VS cell line HEI-193, derived from a patient
with neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2), was obtained from Dr.
Giovanni at the House Ear Institute (Hung et al., 2002a,b).

from Life Technologies). The vehicle used for siRNA delivery
was RNAiMax (#13778030, Life Technologies). Some cultures
were incubated with a ﬂuorescent red oligo (Life Technologies)
with vehicle to assess transfection efﬁciency.

For pharmacologic treatment, cultured primary VS cells,
primary SCs and HEI-193 cells were treated for 48 h with NF-
kB inhibitors BAY 11-7082 (BAY11, #sc-200615) or curcumin
(#sc-200509A)
(both purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology) in media fortiﬁed with antibiotics and serum. BAY11
or curcumin, diluted in 100% DMSO, were mixed to the accu-
rate concentrations in media and applied to the cultures
(with DMSO concentration in media being 1% maximum),
alongside no treatment (NT) with DMSO alone.

After treatment, proliferation or apoptosis was assessed as
previously detailed (Dilwali et al., 2014). Brieﬂy, cell prolifera-
-Deoxyuridine
tion was quantiﬁed by adding 5-Bromo-2
(BrdU, Invitrogen) to the cultured cells 20 h prior to ﬁxation.
Primary antibodies against BrdU (AbD Serotec, #OBT0030G),
S100 (Dako, #Z031129), or p50 (Abcam, #ab7971) were used.
For assessing apoptosis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl trans-
ferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL, Roche Applied Sci-
C and 0.5 h at RT on the
ences) was applied for 1 h at 37
shaker after ﬁxation and permeabilization. Cells were counted
by an investigator (S.D.) blinded to the treatment conditions.
Cells were counted in 3 ﬁelds. Cell proliferation and
apoptosis were reported as percent BrdU positive and TUNEL
positive nuclei, respectively. As a validation for TUNEL stain-
ing, apoptosis was also assessed using immunocytochemistry
by the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in cells treated with
siRNA or curcumin. Antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Cell
Signaling Technology, #9661) was utilized. The inhibitors
were compared to the control group by normalizing the
percent change in proliferation or percent of apoptosis in
comparison to the non-treated cells.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (gel shift assay)

The gel shift assay was performed using the LightShift Chemi-

Of the 622 articles identiﬁed, 19 met our inclusion criteria
(Aarhus et al., 2010; Archibald et al., 2010; Bian et al., 2005;

221 molecules eligible for network analysis: 162 overexpressed
and 59 underexpressed molecules in sporadic VS. IPA gener-
ated a total of 19 networks. Supplementary Table S1 shows
the hubs of the top 14 networks. Here we focus on validation

of the hub of the second most signiﬁcant network (p ¼ 10

Figure 1). We focus on NF-kB because it is a key pro-
inﬂammatory transcription factor that could be an important
therapeutic target in VS (Ammoun et al., 2013), and TNFa, an
inducer of NF-kB, was the hub of another top-ranking network
(Supplementary Table S1).

signiﬁcantly, with p ¼ 0.18 and 0.17, respectively (Figure 2A).
Non-canonical components REL, RELB and NFKB2 exhibited
different patterns of expression. REL was 3.1 (1.0e9.4) fold
higher in VSs (n ¼ 13) than in GANs (n ¼ 10) (p ¼ 0.01,
Figure 2A). NFKB2 had the same average expression in VSs

as GANs (p ¼ 0.22, Figure 2A). Interestingly, RELB was 0.4
(0.2e1.0) fold downregulated in VSs (n ¼ 13) compared to
GANs (range 0.5e2.1, n ¼ 10) (p ¼ 0.02, Figure 2A).

Exploring the downstream genes with kB binding sites by
qPCR, two genes under canonical NF-kB control were signiﬁ-
cantly upregulated in VSs (n ¼ 15) relative to GANs (n ¼ 15):

pro-proliferative CCND1 at 8.1 (5.7e11.5) fold (p ¼ 0.0007) and
anti-apoptotic BCL2 at 4.9 (3.3e7.1) fold (p ¼ 0.02, Figure 2A).
The ranges in GAN were 0.7e1.4 and 0.8e1.3 for CCND1 and
BCL2, respectively. Anti-apoptotic XIAP was equally expressed
in VSs (n ¼ 12) and GANs (n ¼ 7) (p ¼ 0.18, Figure 2A). Pro-
proliferative CSF2 tended to be downregulated, albeit not
signiﬁcantly (p ¼ 0.11, Figure 2A), in VSs (n ¼ 9) compared to
GANs (n ¼ 7).

Upstream regulator of the canonical NF-kB pathway, gene
TNF encoding TNFa, was expressed at 11.7 (7.9e17.4) fold
higher levels in VSs (n ¼ 10) than in GANs (range 0.7e1.5,
n ¼ 10) (p ¼ 0.003, Figure 2A). Upstream regulator of the non-
canonical NF-kB pathway, RANKL gene TNFS11 tended to be
downregulated in VSs (n ¼ 10) than in GANs (n ¼ 10), although
not signiﬁcantly (p ¼ 0.20, Figure 2A).

Following qPCR, NF-kB translation and activation were
assessed. Western blot analysis revealed that NF-kB canonical
pathway was substantially activated in VSs compared to
GANs. TNFa activates inhibitor of kappa B kinase (Ikk), which
phosphorylates inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IkBa), enabling the
heterodimer of NF-kB p65 and p50 to phosphorylate and relo-
cate to the nucleus to promote transcription of genes impor-
tant for survival and proliferation (Karin, 1999). Western blot
data are summarized as average fold change  standard devi-
ation, with “n” indicating the number of different tumors or
nerves. The representative western blot results are shown in
Supplementary Figure S1 and the statistical results are shown
in Figure 2B. The internal control protein, GAPDH, was not
signiﬁcantly different between VSs and GANs (p ¼ 0.36). NF-
kB p65 (encoded by the RELA gene) and p105 (encoded by the
NFKB1 gene) had an insigniﬁcant trend of being more abun-
dant in VSs (n ¼ 7e10) than in GANs (n ¼ 7e9), with p ¼ 0.09
and ¼ 0.14, respectively (Figure 2B). The phosphorylated
form of p65 was 4.2  3.1 fold more expressed in VSs (n ¼ 9)
compared to GANs (n ¼ 8, p ¼ 0.03, Figure 2B). p105’s derived
subunit p50 likewise showed tendency for higher expression,
albeit non-signiﬁcant, in VSs (n ¼ 15) compared to GANs
(n ¼ 11, p ¼ 0.10, Figure 2B). NF-kB’s canonical inducer,
TNFa, was 5.4  0.7 fold more abundant in VS (n ¼ 4) than in
GAN (n ¼ 4, p ¼ 0.001, Figure 2B), demonstrating the same
trend as seen through qPCR. The phosphorylated form of
IkBa was also 2.8  0.8 fold higher in VSs (n ¼ 4) than in
GANs (n ¼ 4, p ¼ 0.01, Figure 2B).

The expression of NF-kB non-canonical proteins c-Rel
(encoded by REL gene) and p100 (encoded by NFKB2 gene)
mirrored the corresponding mRNA expression: c-Rel was
3.6  0.8 fold more expressed in VSs (n ¼ 7) than in GANs
(n ¼ 7, p ¼ 0.003, Figure 2B). p100 was not different in VSs
(n ¼ 4) compared to GANs (n ¼ 4, p ¼ 0.42, Figure 2B). Interest-
ingly, expression of Rel B protein (encoded by RELB) was
signiﬁcantly, 3.3  1fold higher in VSs (n ¼ 7) than in GANs
(n ¼ 7, p ¼ 0.006), demonstrating the opposite trend from the
corresponding mRNA. Taken together, these results demon-
strate presence and basal activation of NF-kB in GANs and
VSs, and consistently higher activation of the canonical NF-
kB pathway in VSs.

Immunohistochemistry in 5 different VS and 4 different
GAN samples veriﬁed that NF-kB was active in VS as the
p50 subunit
in VS specimens
(Figure 2C (b)), thus corroborating the western blot results

localized to the nuclei

demonstrating a higher level of phosphorylation, and hence
activation of NF-kB in VSs. GAN specimens showed minimal
p50 nuclear localization although p50 was present in the cyto-
plasm (Figure 2C (a)). S100, a marker for SCs, highlights
schwannoma cells in VS specimens and SCs encasing the
nerve ﬁbrils in GANs (Figure 2C (a)). Additionally, CD163-
positive tumor-associated macrophages were present in the
same VSs at substantially higher levels than in GANs
(Figure 2D), indicating an aberrant inﬂammatory presence in
VS as described previously (de Vries et al., 2013). Taken
together, our results demonstrating activation of p50 and
several other proteins associated with NF-kB in VS expand
on the previous ﬁnding of p65 activation in VS cells
(Ammoun et al., 2013).

To further conﬁrm the activation of the NF-kB pathway in
VS tissues, the gel shift assay was performed and the DNA
binding activities in VS tissues and GAN tissues were
compared. To provide enough nuclear extracts for the assay,
VS tissues were pooled from 4 patients and GAN tissues
were pooled from 6 patients. The binding of NF-kB p65-p50
heterodimer to its binding site was avid in the VS nuclear
extract and not detectable in the GAN nuclear extract
(Figure 2E). The interaction in the VS nuclear extract could
be blocked by adding the excess non-labeled oligos containing
the NF-kB binding site (Figure 2E, lane 6). These results indi-
cate that the NF-kB activity was speciﬁcally elevated in VS
tissues.

and survival of VS cultured cells

The NF-kB canonical pathway was also expressed and acti-
vated at signiﬁcantly higher levels in primary VS cultures
(n ¼ 6 different tumors) compared to SC cultures (n ¼ 6
different nerves) (Figure 3A). NF-kB p65 and its phosphory-
lated form had 1.9  0.4 fold (p ¼ 0.01) and 2.8  0.4 fold
(p ¼ 0.02) higher expression in VS cells compared to SCs,
respectively. NF-kB p105 and its derived subunit p50 were pre-
sent in cultures, although not at signiﬁcantly higher levels
than in SCs (p ¼ 1.0 and p ¼ 0.06, respectively, Figure 3A).

Applying siRNAs targeting RELA and NFKB1 concurrently
decreased proliferation, as measured by nuclear BrdU stain-
ing, and cell survival, as measured by the TUNEL assay. Re-
sults are summarized as average  standard error of mean
(SEM), with “n” referring to the number of cultures from
different specimens. Proliferation changes are normalized to
each culture’s proliferation rate. Transfection efﬁciency of
approximately 94  3% was achieved in primary VS cells
(n ¼ 3), as assessed by transfection of a ﬂuorescent red-
labeled oligo (Figure 3B). The siRNA-mediated knockdown of
NFKB1 and RELA in VS cells was detected using western blot
and the results are shown in Supplementary Figures S2A
and S2B, respectively. Basal proliferation in VS cultures
treated with scrambled siRNA was 6.5%  2.6% (n ¼ 4,

62.33%  10.59% after siRNA treatment (n ¼ 4, p ¼ 0.025,

siRNA only exhibiting TUNEL staining was 8.59%  4.92%

decreases proliferation and survival selectively in primary

Primary VS cells, control SC cultures and the HEI-193 cell line
were treated with BAY11. BAY11 treatment signiﬁcantly
decreased the activity of the NF-kB pathway as shown by the
decrease of phosphorylated p65 in western blot (Fig. S2C,

of “n” and “p” as for siRNA application. Treatment with 1 and

Clinically-relevant NF-kB inhibitor curcumin

decreases proliferation and survival in cultured primary VS
cells, NF2 VS cell line and primary SCs

Curcumin, a natural, well-tolerated NF-kB inhibitor that is
currently used in many clinical trials for various neurological,
inﬂammatory and neoplastic diseases, ranging from Alz-
heimer’s disease to colon cancer (Hatcher et al., 2008), was

tested in VS cells. Treatment of curcumin signiﬁcantly
decreased the activity of the NF-kB pathway as shown by the
decrease of phosphorylated p65 in western blot (Fig. S2, right).
Results are reported using the same format and meaning of
“n” and “p” as for siRNA application. Proliferation decreased
in a dose-dependent manner in VS cultures, with VS cells
receiving NT, 5, 20 and 50 mM curcumin (Figure 5A (aed,
respectively)) exhibiting normalized proliferation rates of
100.0%  30.5%, 141.8%  95.2% (p ¼ 0.57), 23.0  20.9%
(p ¼ 0.03) and 9.8  5.3 (p ¼ 0.0005) (n ¼ 3, Figure 5B). Apoptosis
also increased in a dose-dependent manner, with VS cells

strate a statistically signiﬁcant apoptosis-inducing effect of
50 mM curcumin in VS cells (n ¼ 3, p ¼ 0.02, Fig. S3B). Taken
together, these results suggest that the decrease of NF-kB by
curcumin may be the mechanism leading to apoptosis in VS
cells.

Surprisingly, in contrast to the seemingly well-tolerated
proﬁle for curcumin in humans, curcumin decreased prolifer-
ation and increased apoptosis in control SC cultures at con-
centrations comparable to those efﬁcacious in VS cultures.

icant only at the highest tested dose. Apoptosis had the same

trend with the highest dose leading to a signiﬁcant increase in

(Figure 5D). Nonetheless, the doses up to 20 mM seemed selec-
tively cytostatic against primary VS cells.

Intriguingly, the HEI-193 cells were more susceptible to
curcumin than primary VS cells or healthy SCs. Proliferation
decreased drastically with dose increases: HEI-193 cells

Discussion

signiﬁcant networks

Conducting the ﬁrst comprehensive network analysis of mol-
ecules implicated in VS pathobiology, we identiﬁed and vali-
dated NF-kB as a central regulator. We also found direct
interactors of NF-kB such as PDGF (Olson et al., 2007), which
have been implicated in VS progression, to be the hubs of
other
(Supplementary Table S1).
Although others have suggested that NF-kB is activated in
VS cells via upstream stimulation such as with p75 signaling
(Ahmad et al., 2014), we ﬁnd that NF-kB is inherently highly
active in human VS tissue and derived primary VS cells. The
apparent disparity may be due to differences in detection
methods or sample processing. As all prior experiments had
been conducted on cultured cells and cell lines, we are the ﬁrst
to show that the aberrant NF-kB activation occurs also in the
freshly resected VS tissue and cannot be deemed an artifact
of culturing.

Our analysis of expression signatures of the downstream
NF-kB genes in VS suggests a unique NF-kB target gene pro-
gram in VS, as may be expected in pathologic inﬂammation
(Hoesel and Schmid, 2013). Since NF-kB is highly expressed
by immature SCs during development, progressively declining
from pre-myelinating SCs to near absence in mature myeli-
nating SCs (Nickols et al., 2003), our ﬁndings are also consis-
tent with VSs exhibiting a gene expression proﬁle akin to
immature SCs (Hung et al., 2002a,b). Pre-existing upregulation
of NF-kB in VSs, along with a few deﬁning mutations in other
genes,
could enable neoplastic proliferation of non-
myelinating SCs.

Using a pre-clinical model of primary human VS cells, we
demonstrate potential therapeutic efﬁcacy of directly targeting
NF-kB via experimental and clinical inhibitors. Our work with
freshly harvested VS samples from different patients captures
the variability of NF-kB aberrance in different VSs. Our results
suggest that therapeutic targeting of NF-kB may be generally
effective against VSs, not only against a small subset of VSs.
By utilizing three different modalities to inhibit NF-kB: (1)
highly-speciﬁc siRNAs against the NF-kB p50 and p65, (2) a
pharmacologic inhibitor BAY11 and (3) a clinically-relevant,
natural inhibitor curcumin, we afﬁrm NF-kB’s role in VS prolif-
eration and survival. We reinforce previous ﬁndings that siRNA
mediated NF-kB knockdown in primary VS cells reduces prolif-
eration and survival (Ammoun et al., 2013), and expand on
them by using more clinically relevant inhibitors.

A small molecule NF-kB inhibitor BAY11 showed a high
level of efﬁcacy and speciﬁcity against VS cells. Although
BAY11 has been characterized as an effective inhibitor of
NF-kB by inhibiting IkK activation, recently BAY11 has been
recognized to target many other pro-inﬂammatory molecules,
including TNFa (Lee et al., 2012a,b). Future work is needed to
determine whether the therapeutic efﬁcacy of BAY11 against
VS cells is solely due to NF-kB inhibition. As BAY11 was not
cytotoxic in primary SCs and has been well tolerated in vivo
in murine tumor xenograft studies (Dewan et al., 2003), future

exploration of BAY11 against VS in animal models in vivo is
warranted.

Curcumin, a clinically relevant NF-kB inhibitor that has
been tested in many clinical trials (Hatcher et al., 2008),
inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of both pri-
mary VS cells and HEI-193 VS cells. Curcumin’s greater effec-
tiveness against HEI-193 VS cells at a lower dose than
required for primary VS cells suggests a higher therapeutic ef-
ﬁcacy against NF2-derived than sporadic VSs. The dosage
curve of curcumin resembles a previously established dosage
curve for HEI-193 cells in a study that focused on another mole-
cule through which curcumin may be acting: Hsp70 (Angelo
et al., 2011). A follow-up study by the same authors investi-
gating curcumin’s direct binding partners did not reveal the
NF-kB complex being a target in HEI-193 cells (Angelo et al.,
2013), although the authors had previously reported inhibition
of phosphorylation of Protein Kinase B (AKT), an upstream
regulator of NF-kB activation (Angelo et al., 2011; Bai et al.,
2009). This is in contrast to the large body of literature that
shows curcumin’s role as an NF-kB inhibitor, via inhibition of
TNFa-induced IkB degradation (Hatcher et al., 2008), and as a
general inhibitor of inﬂammation (Hatcher et al., 2008; Marin
et al., 2007). It is important to acknowledge that although cur-
cumin was found to be efﬁcacious against colon cancer and
Alzheimer’s disease in animal and human studies, therapeutic
and toxicity proﬁles of curcumin have not been comprehen-
sively elucidated (Burgos-Moron et al., 2010). Some clinical tri-
als have noted nausea and diarrhea in patients taking
curcumin (Burgos-Moron et al., 2010). Since the levels of curcu-
min that led to primary VS and SC death were comparable,
more research is required on curcumin’s toxicity proﬁle, best
formulation and administration methods and its efﬁcacy in
brain diseases. Importantly, however, curcumin has recently
been shown to have otoprotective effect against aminoglyco-
side toxicity and the associated hearing loss (HL)
(Salehi
et al., 2014). Since most VS patients present with HL, future
studies are needed to explore whether curcumin could atten-
uate both VS growth and the associated HL simultaneously.

By establishing aberrance of several molecules involved in
the NF-kB pathway and efﬁcacy of NF-kB inhibition selectively
in VS cells via several inhibitors, we demonstrate NF-kB as a
potential pharmacologic target against VS. However, possible
future clinical targeting of NF-kB has to be considered care-
fully given that NF-kB is an important signaling node that
most cells rely on.
