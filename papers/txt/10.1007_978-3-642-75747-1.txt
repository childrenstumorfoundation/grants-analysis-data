Preface 

A  host  of  environmental  factors  regulate  the  embryonic 
development of neurons. In adults, the survival of neurons, the 
regeneration of damaged axons, and plastic changes in axonal 
arborization  are  also  controlled  by  a  complex  array  of 
environmental  cues.  An  important  category  of  regulatory 
influences  involves  target-derived  hormone-like  peptides  act(cid:173)
ing  on  neuronal  cell  surface  receptors.  Nerve  growth  factor 
(NGF)  was  the  first  such  factor  to  be  characterized  (LEVI(cid:173)
MONTALCINI and HAMBURGER  1953) and has served as the model 
against  which  all  similar  factors  are  compared.  A number  of 
factors  with  properties  similar  to  NGF  have  been  described 
with activities toward differing populations of neurons. Many of 
these  factors  have  been  characterized  only  poorly  at  the 
biochemical level.  However, several factors  have been charac(cid:173)
terized  to  the  extent  that molecular clones  are  available  and 
complete amino acid sequences are known. These include: three 
structurally  related  factors,  NGF  itself  (SCOTT  et al.  1983), 
brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF)  (LEIBROCK  et al. 
1989),  and neurotrophin-3  (NT-3)  (MAISONPIERRE  et al.  1990; 
HOHN et al. 1990); ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (LIN et al. 
1989) and a second set of structural homologs; acidic and basic 
fibroblast growth factors (aFGF, bFGF) (ABRAHAM et al.  1986; 
JAYE  et al.  1986).  Investigators  have  cloned  the  receptors  for 
NGF (JOHNSON  et al.  1986;  RADEKE  et al.  1987) and FGF (LEE 
et al.  1989). 

As  the  NGF  and  FGF  systems  have  been  the  most 
extensively  characterized,  the  biology  of  these  two  peptide 
factors,  or,  more precisely,  families  of peptide  factors,  will  be 
described in detail in this volume. It is our expectation that the 
information obtained from  the NGF and FGF systems will be 
invaluable for  understanding  the functional  properties  of the 
numerous similarfactors which remain to be characterized. The 
NGF and  FGF systems  also  serve  to illustrate an important 
point: NGF was originally discovered as a neurotrophic factor. 
However,  as  will  be  discussed  in  the  following  pages,  it  is

becoming clear that NGF and the NGF receptor are involved in 
regulation  of a  variety  of non-neural  cell  types.  Conversely, 
while aFGF and bFGF were originally discovered as mitogens 
for  non-neural cell types, it is now clear that they have potent 
neurotrophic  activity.  Epidermal  growth  factor  is  another 
mitogenic  growth  factor  which  has  been  reported  to  have 
neurotrophic  activity  (MORRISON  et al.  1988).  It is  likely  that 
many of the growing list of mitogenic growth factors  will have 
specific  regulatory  functions  for  specific  populations  of post(cid:173)
mitotic neurons.

1  Introduction 

The  first  description  of nerve  growth  factor  (NGF) by  LEVI-MONTALCINI  and 
HAMBURGER (1953)  was  of a factor from  mouse sarcoma cells (S-180 and S-37) 
that elicited  extensive  growth  of chick  embryo  neurons.  Shortly  thereafter,  a

serendipitous use of snake venom in the purification of this factor led COHEN to 
the discovery that NGF was present in moccasin snake venom as  well (COHEN 
and LEVI-MoNTALCINI  1956). The finding that the mouse submaxillary gland-a 
homologue of snake venom glands-stores even larger quantities of NGF than 
does the snake venom gland (COHEN  1960) led to the extensive analyses of mouse 
salivary NGF that continue today. 

The ability to elicit nerve fiber outgrowth from cultured chick embryo sensory 
or  sympathetic  ganglia  is  still  the  most  reliable  bioassay  for  NGF  activity. 
Despite a  large number of tissues  shown  to exhibit  this  activity,  there  are  few 
sources  of mammalian  NGF  sufficiently  rich  for  purification  and  molecular 
experimentation.  The  submaxillary  gland  of  the  male  mouse  has  been  the 
traditional source; the ability to purify significant amounts of this protein led to 
the development of antibodies for immunoassay (SUDA  et al.  1978;  KORSCHING 
and THOENEN  1983; LARKFORS and EBENDAL  1987) and to the cloning of the gene 
for  murine NGF (SCOTT et al.  1983; ULLRICH  et al.  1983).  However, the limited 
quantities  of  NGF  present  in  other  species  and  tissues  as  well  as  the  poor 
immunological cross-reactivity among NGFs from  different  species have ham(cid:173)
pered  experimentation.  In  recent  years,  comparative  study  of  NGF  has 
intensified due to  the highly conserved  nucleic acid  sequences  of NGF among 
species.  This  review  will  focus  on  the  comparative  aspects  of  the  structure, 
biosynthesis,  and processing  of NGF from  a  number of sources. 

2  Structure of N G F 

2.1  Murine  NGF 

The structure, synthesis,  and biological  activity  of NGF have been extensively 
studied in the mouse, but little is known about its processing or regulation. High 
molecular  weight  NGF  isolated  from  mouse  submaxillary  glands  has  a 
sedimentation coefficient  of 7S,  from  which a  molecular weight of 140000 was 
calculated (V ARON  et al.  1968).  The complex consists of three types  of subunits 
(SERVER  and  SHOOTER  1977):  j3,  r,  and Ct.. 

2.1.1  The P Subunit 

The  most  extensively  studied  subunit,  j3-NGF,  is  responsible  for  the  nerve 
growth-promoting activity. cDNA clones for the j3 subunit have been obtained by 
two  research  groups (ULLRICH  et al.  1983;  SCOTT  et al.  1983),  and the genomic 
sequence  including  promoter  also  has  been  determined  (SELBY  et al  1987b; 
ZHENG  and  HEINRICH  1988).  j3-NGF  is  present  in  the  7S  complex  as  a 
noncovalently linked dimer of molecular weight 26000; strong denaturing agents 
separate  j3-NGF  into  two  identical  chains  118  amino  acids  long  (VARON  and 
SHOOTER  1970).  Both  monomers  and  dimers  are  biologically  active  (FRAZIER 

Structure and Biosynthesis of Nerve  Growth Factor 

3 

et al.  1973a;  STACH  and SHOOTER  1974).  Each chain  contains  three  intrachain 
disulfide bonds, and reduction of these bonds causes complete loss of biological 
activity  (GREENE  and  SHOOTER  1980;  THOENEN  and  BARDE  1980).  Although 
tyrosine residues are not required for activity, tryptophan residues are important 
for biological activity, since oxidation of Trp-21 causes loss ofNGF activity and 
receptor binding (FRAZIER  et al.  1973b;  COHEN  et al.  1980).  A potential glycosyl(cid:173)
ation site exists in the mature NGF protein at Asn-45. Although the molecule was 
thought not to be glycosylated (ANGELETTI et al. 1973), a glycosylated form exists 
in the mouse submaxillary gland in  small  amounts (MURPHY  et al.  1989).  The 
biological activity of the glycosylated form  does  not differ from  the nonglycosy(cid:173)
lated form. The isoelectric point of the fJ subunit is 9.4, making fJ-NGF the most 
basic of the three subunits. 
2.1.2  The  r Subunit 

The two  y subunits of the 7S  NGF complex are responsible for its proteolytic 
activity (GREENE et al. 1969). Both the amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the 
y subunit  have  been  determined,  and  they  demonstrate  that it  belongs  to  the 
kallikrein family of trypsin-like serine proteases (THOMAS et al.  1981a; ULLRICH 
et al. 1984; EVANS and RICHARDS 1985). Like other kallikreins, the y subunit has a 
molecular weight of 26000 and is  glycosylated. 

The y subunit displays a  high degree of electrophoretic heterogeneity; up to 
six different forms have been identified (STACH et al.  1976; THOMAS et al.  1981b). 
The different forms of the y subunit contain either two or three chains connected 
by  disulfide  bridges.  The  two  and  three  chain  forms  arise  by endoproteolytic 
cleavage of a single chain protein at two sites. C-terminal basic residues located at 
these internal cleavage sites are removed from some molecules to create further 
heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is not due to the variability of the tissue source, 
however, since each submaxillary gland contains all six forms (SMITH et al. 1968). 
The esterase activities of the different forms  of the y subunit are all equivalent 
(SERVER  and  SHOOTER  1977).  Although  no  biological  significance  has  been 
demonstrated for the existence of six different forms, a 7S complex formed with y3 
(a  three  chain  form)  is  the  most  stable  (THOMAS  et al.  1981b;  NICHOLS  and 
SHOOTER  1983). Since cleavage of they subunit into its most modified form (y3) 
occurs  during  the  secretion  of 7S  NGF into  saliva (BURTON  et al.  1978),  this 
processing may increase the stability of the complex in saliva. 

The y subunit has been implicated in the processing of the fJ-NGF precursor 
(see Sect. 3). The C-terminal amino acid sequence of the fJ-NGF precursor is Arg(cid:173)
Arg-Gly. The y subunit cleaves the bond between the two Arg residues, liberating 
a dipeptide, and remains bound to the C-terminal Arg residue of fJ-NGF (BERGER 
and SHOOTER 1977; BOTHWELL and SHOOTER 1978). Removing the C-terminal Arg 
with carboxypeptidase B prevents the y subunit from binding to fJ-NGF and thus 
prevents formation ofthe 7S complex (MOORE et al. 1974). It has been postulated, 
therefore,  that  the  y subunit  binds  to  the  C-terminal  of fJ-NGF  at  its  active 
site.

M.  Fahnestock 

It is  unclear  whether  in vivo  the  I'  subunit  cleaves  only  the  C-terminal 
dipeptide of f3-NGF oris involved in the N-terminal processing of f3-NGF as well, 
since both the I' subunit and trypsin are able to correctly process the N-terminal 
end ofthe f3-NGF precursor (see Sect. 4). It is also unclear whether other enzymes 
process  the  f3-NGF  precursor, since  the I' subunit  has not been found  in most 
tissues. 

2.1.3  The a Subunit 

The complete  nucleotide sequence  of the  0:  subunit demonstrates  that  there is 
significant homology between the 0:  and I' subunits and reveals that the 0: subunit 
is a glandular kallikrein as well (EVANS and RICHARDS 1985; ISACKSON et al. 1984). 
However,  the  0:  subunit lacks  enzymatic activity,  probably due  to  amino  acid 
changes  near the  active  site  and  at  the  N-terminal  (ISACKSON  and  BRADSHAW 
1984).  Its function  in the 7S NGF complex is  unknown, although it may protect 
f3-NGF from proteolytic degradation and may regulate its biological activity (see 
Sect.  5). 

Like the I' subunits, the 0:  subunits are glycosylated and are heterogeneous in 
isoelectric point. The origin of this heterogeneity has been less well-studied for the 
0:  subunits than for the I' subunits, but it appears that the 0:  subunits are found 
only  in  the  two  chain form.  A  model  whereby  differential  processing  of the  0: 
subunit at a  single  region  (residues  135-137) could produce four  different  two 
chain forms  has  been  presented  by  ISACKSON  et al.  (1987).  The  0:  subunits  are 
slightly more acidic than the I' subunits, ranging in isoelectric point from 4.1  to 
4.6, whereas the isoelectric points of the I' subunits range from 5.2 to 5.8 (VARON 
and SHOOTER  1970). Unlike the I' subunits, the four forms of the 0:  subunits show 
no differential binding to f3-NGF (SMITH et al. 1968). There are two 0: subunits per 
7S  complex, making the stoichiometry of 7S  NGF 0:2f31'2  (SERVER  and SHOOTER 
1977). 

2.2  High Molecular Weight  NGF 

The  7S  complex  is  most  stable  between  pH 5.0  and  8.0  but  can  be  reversibly 
dissociated into its subunits by extremes of pH (VARON  et al.  1968; SMITH  et al. 
1968). In the mouse submaxillary gland, 7S  NGF may exist in equilibrium with 
significant amounts of dissociated subunits (VARON and SHOOTER 1970; PANTAZIS 
and JENSEN  1985) and with various forms  of less than 7S (YOUNG et al.  1978). In 
fact,  the first  NGF complex,  purified  by COHEN  in  1960,  had  a  sedimentation 
coefficient  of 4.3S.  Although its  subunit  composition has  not  been  elucidated, 
SERVER  and  SHOOTER  demonstrated  that,  in  the  absence  of I'  subunits,  an 0:2f3 
complex can form (1976). YOUNG et al. (1988) have isolated a submaxillary gland 
high  molecular  weight  NGF  with  a  stoichiometry  of  iY. 2 f3i'.  However,  the 
biological significance, if any, of these other forms of high molecular weight NGF 
has  not  been established. 

Structure and  Biosynthesis  of Nerve Growth  Factor

Several other factors besides pH influence the stability of the high molecular 
weight NGF complex. For example, 7S  NGF contains one or two zinc ions that 
stabilize the complex (PATTISON and DUNN  1975; BOTHWELL and SHOOTER  1977). 
The zinc may bind to  the y subunit in the complex, since it has been shown to 
inhibit the activity of the y subunit. Also, YOUNG et al. (1988) demonstrated that a 
complex containing only one  y subunit contains  only  one zinc ion. 

Whereas  7S  NGF is  isolated  as  a  complex  in  which  the  CI.  and  y  subunits 
protect the f3 subunit from proteolysis, 2.5S NGF is isolated by dissociation of the 
7S  complex  prior  to  the  end  of the  purification  procedure,  which  encourages 
proteolysis of the f3  subunit by contaminating proteases and carboxypeptidases 
(BOCCHINI  and ANGELETTI  1969; ANGELETTI  et al.  1973). 2.5S NGF consists of a 
mixture of molecules modified at both N- and C-terminals (see Sect. 4 for details 
of these  modifications).  Proteolysis  at  the  C-terminal end  of f3-NGF  prevents 
reassociation of the subunits into the 7S  complex. 

Binding  of CI.  and  y  subunits  to  f3-NGF  regulates  its  biological  activity  in 
mouse  submaxillary  gland  and  saliva  by  influencing  precursor  processing, 
protecting f3-NGF from proteolytic degradation, and inhibiting receptor binding 
(EDWARDS  et al.  1988a;  NICHOLS  and  SHOOTER  1985;  HARRIS-WARRICK  et al. 
1980). The evidence for the existence ofNGF binding molecules in other species 
and tissues (see below) and the potential importance of this means of regulation 
suggest that NGF binding molecules should be studied in  other species.  These 
regulatory molecules  mayor may not be  CI.- or y-like  proteins. 

3  Sources  of N G F 

There are  few  sources  of NGF sufficiently  rich  for  purification and  molecular 
experimentation. The traditional source has been the submaxillary gland of the 
male mouse. Fighting among male mice results in the discharge oflarge amounts 
of salivary NGF into the bloodstream, suggesting that NGF may be important in 
the fighting mechanisms of male mice (ALOE  et al.  1986).  However, the salivary 
glands of other animals do not synthesize high levels of NG F, so the function of 
mouse submaxillary gland NGF in this tissue remains speculative.  Reasonably 
high levels  of NGF are contained in several other exocrine tissues  and in their 
secretions,  including  snake  venom  (COHEN  1959;  ANGELETTI  1968;  HOGUE(cid:173)
ANGELETTI  et al.  1976;  BAILEY  et al.  1975), guinea pig prostate (CHAPMAN  et al. 
1981; RUBIN and BRADSHAW 1981), bull semen and seminal vesicles (HARPER et al. 
1982; HOFFMAN  and UNSICKER  1982), and the submaxillary gland of the African 
rat, Mastomys natalensis (ALOE et al. 1981; DARLING and FAHNESTOCK 1988). The 
physiological function  of NGF from  these  sources  is  also  unknown. 

NGF from other (endocrine) sources is synthesized in much smaller amounts 
than  in  the  exocrine  tissues  and,  therefore,  with  few  exceptions,  NGF  from 
nonexocrine  sources  has  been  characterized  only  at  the  nucleic  acid  level.

Isolation of cDNA clone coding for  mouse NGF (SCOTT  et al.  1983;  ULLRICH 
et al.  1983) led to the cloning of bovine, avian, rat, guinea pig,  Mastomys,  and 
human NGF genes  (MEIER  et al.  1986;  EBENDAL  et al.  1986;  WION  et al.  1986; 
WmTTEMORE  et al.  1988;  SCHWARZ  et al.  1989;  FAHNESTOCK  and  BELL  1988; 
ULLRICH  et aI.  1983),  demonstrating  excellent  conservation  of the  NGF  se(cid:173)
quence  among divergent  species. 

This  homology  contrasts  with  the  poor  immunological  cross-reactivity 
among NGFs of different species. In some cases, antibodies to mouse NGF have 
shown no cross-reactivity with NGF from chick, bull, and human (BAILEY et aI. 
1976;  SERVER  and  SHOOTER  1977;  WALKER  et al.  1980;  BECK  and  PEREZ-POLO 
1982; HARPER and THOENEN 1981). In other cases, at least partial cross-reactivity 
was obtained between anti-mouse fJ-NGF and the NGF from Mastomys, human 
glial cells,  guinea pig,  and chick  (DARLING  and FAHNESTOCK  1988;  NORRGREN 
et al.  1980;  CHAPMAN  et al.  1981;  BELEW  and  EBENDAL  1986).  Although  the 
variable cross-reactivity is  puzzling for  such a  highly  conserved  molecule,  the 
presence  of clusters  of nonconserved  residues  located  in  potentially  antigenic 
regions of an otherwise highly conserved molecule may be responsible (MEIER 
et al.  1986;  WmTTEMORE  et al.  1988).  Alternatively,  molecules  that  bind  NGF 
in vivo  may  interfere  with  the  binding  of antibodies  to  the  fJ  subunit,  thus 
preventing inhibition of biological activity when the bioassay is performed with 
partially purified NGF. 

There is evidence that NGF from other tissues or sources may be found as 
high molecular weight complexes, but there is little, if any, evidence for IX- or y-like 
subunits in any tissues other than mouse and M astom ys submaxillary glands and 
snake venom gland. 

3.1  Mastomys NGF 
Mastomys  natalensis  is  a  South  African  rodent  whose  submaxillary  glands 
contain high levels ofNGF (ALOE et al.  1981). High molecular weight NGF can 
be purified from  both male and female  Mastomys (DARLING  and  FAHNESTOCK 
1988).  This  material  exhibits  nerve  growth-promoting  activity  comparable  to 
that of the mouse, but it sediments at 5.1S,  whereas the mouse high molecular 
weight complex sediments at 7S.  Moreover, the 5S  Mastomys complex exhibits 
no esterase activity, suggesting that this complex lacks y subunits. The two types 
of subunit in the 5S complex migrate identically to mouse fJ  and IX  subunits on 
isoelectric focusing  gels  and SDS-PAGE. 

The sequence  of the  fJ-NGF  cDNA of Mastomys  is  highly  homologous to 
that  of  the  mouse  (FAHNESTOCK  and  BELL  1988),  and  antibodies  raised  in 
rabbits  against  mouse  fJ-NGF  cross-react  with  Mastomys  fJ-NGF  (DARLING 
and  FAHNESTOCK  1988).  However,  Mastomys  fJ-NGF  is  resistant  to  carbo(cid:173)
xypeptidase  B digestion  (Fig.  1),  which  in  the  mouse  removes  the  C-terminal 
arginine and prevents  binding  of the  y subunit.  This  resistance,  as  well  as  the 
lack  of a  y subunit in the  5S  complex, raised  questions  about the structure of 
the C-terminal of Mastomys fJ-NGF.  The C-terminal sequence of the Mastomys

fJ  subunit precursor cDNA is  Pro-Arg-Arg-Gly, similar to the mouse sequence, 
Thr-Arg-Arg-Gly  (FAHNESTOCK  and  BELL  1988).  The  Mastomys  fJ-NGF  pre(cid:173)
cursor, like the mouse fJ-NGF, should be cleavable by a y-like enzyme.  M astomys 
and mouse fJ-NGFs show identical charge properties on isoelectric focusing gels, 
supporting the conclusion that this dipeptide is cleaved in mature Mastomys fJ(cid:173)
NGF.  However,  this  cleavage  results  in  the  presence  of a  penultimate  proline 
residue, which we postulate is responsible for the resistance of Mastomys fJ-NGF 
to  carboxypeptidase  B  and  which  may  reduce  the  binding  affinity  of a  y-like 
enzyme to the  C-terminal of Mastomys  fJ-NGF. 

The identity. of the second subunit of the M astomys 5S complex is less clear. 
The lack of esterase activity in the 5S complex indicates that the second subunit is 
a-like  rather  than  y-like.  Although  it  comigrates  with  mouse  a  subunit  on 
isoelectric focusing gels, antibodies raised against mouse a subunit do not cross(cid:173)
react with the M astomys subunit nor do specific oligonucleotides directed against 
the N-terminal of mouse a subunit hybridize to M astomys mRNA (DARLING and 
FAHNESTOCK  1988). 

The Mastomys 5S complex is  more difficult to dissociate than the mouse 7S 
complex. Mouse 7S NGF dissociates at pH 4.0, whereas Mastomys 5S NGF will 
not dissociate under these conditions but instead will dissociate at pH 3.0 in the 
presence of urea (DARLING and FAHNESTOCK 1988). The role of zinc ions has been 
studied in the stabilization of the mouse 7S  complex (BOTHWELL  and SHOOTER 
1978;  PALMER  and NEET  1980)  but not in the Mastomys high  molecular weight 
complex. Since zinc ions are thought to bind primarily through the y subunit, it 
will be of interest to determine whether zinc is important in stabilizing a complex 
that lacks the  y subunit. 

3.2  Snake  Venom NGF 

Snake venom NGF has been isolated as a fJ-y complex from Crotalus adamenteus 
(PEREZ-POLO  et  al.  1978).  Unfortunately,  the  amino  acid  sequence  of  the 

8 

M.  Fahnestock 

C-terminal  portion  of  Crotalus  fi-NGF  has  not  been  determined.  A  high 
molecular weight complex has also been reported for NGF from  Vipera russelli; 
in  this  case,  no  y activity  was  detectable  (PEREZ-POLO  et al.  1983).  A  fi-NGF 
cDNA  from  Naja  naja  (cobra)  has  been  sequenced  completely  (SELBY  et al. 
1987a),  but  a  high  molecular  weight  NGF  has  never  been  isolated  from  this 
species. The C-terminal amino acid sequence suggests a reason:  the amino acid 
sequence of Naja naga fi-NGF, as determined from the nucleic acid sequence, is 
Lys-Lys-Gly-Asn, which might be cleavable by a kallikrein at the Lys  residues. 
However,  sequence  analysis  of  the  protein  isolated  from  the  venom  glands 
showed that the C-terminal residue is asparagine (HOGUE-ANGELETTI et al.  1976) 
indicating that the  C-terminal cleavage does  not take place in  vivo. It should be 
noted that neither mouse y nor r:J.  subunits will  bind to  Naja naja NGF (SERVER 
et al.1976). This may be due to the lack of cleavage at the Lys residues as well as to 
the  requirement  of mouse  y-NGF for  a  C-terminal  arginine  residue. 

3.3  Human  NGF 

Due  to  the  extremely  low  amounts  of  NGF  synthesized  in  human  tissues, 
the  study  of  human  NGF  is  very  difficult.  Many  studies  using  competitive 
immunoglobulin  or  receptor  binding  assays  have  reported  conflicting  NGF 
levels  in  human serum.  Furthermore,  all  are  probably  incorrect,  inasmuch  as 
this assay measures competition by human serum components for NGF binding 
sites  rather  than  the  binding  competition  between  mouse  and  human  NGF 
(THOENEN  and  BARDE  1980).  Human  NGF  has  been  isolated  from  placenta 
and was shown to exhibit partial immunological cross-reactivity with anti-mouse 
fi-NGF  (GOLDSTEIN  et al.  1978).  The exact identity of the  material is  in  doubt, 
since  antibodies to  mouse NGF have not been shown  to inhibit the  biological 
activity of the human material (WALKER et al.  1980; BECK and PEREZ-POLO 1982). 
However, NGF activity has been detected in human glial cells in culture, and this 
activity is  blocked  by  anti-mouse fi- NG F  (NORRGREN  et al.  1980). 

Despite  the  difficulty  of studying the  human  NGF protein,  it  is  clear  that 
NGF is  synthesized  in  human  tissues:  the  presence  of NGF mRNA  has  been 
demonstrated in human placenta, cortex, and hippocampus, with very low levels 
in striatum and septum/nucleus basalis (COLE  et al.  1986; GOEDERT  et al.  1986). 
The  human  NGF  gene  has  been  clone,  and  nucleotide  sequence  analysis 
demonstrates  that  mouse  and  human  NGF  genes  are  highly  homologous 
(ULLRICH  et al.  1983).  Human  NGF has  a  C-terminal  sequence,  Arg-Arg-Ala, 
that is similar to the mouse sequence, Arg-Arg-Gly, and thus could be cleaved by 
a  y subunit.  However,  although  there  is  conflicting  evidence  regarding  y-like 
activity in human placental NGF, no y subunit gene or protein has so far  been 
isolated from human tissues. Nonetheless, it appears that human placental NGF 
may be complexed with an r:J.  subunit (BLUM et al.  1981; PEREZ-POLO et al.  1983).

3.4  Other Sources of NGF 

In the early stages of purification, guinea pig prostate NGF behaves as a  high 
molecular  weight  complex.  CHAPMAN  et al.  (1981)  reported  that  this  complex 
exhibits  esterase  activity,  whereas  RUBIN  and  BRADSHAW  did  not  detect  any 
esterase activity in their high molecular weight complex (1981).  The isoelectric 
focusing  pattern  of  guinea  pig  fI-NGF  suggests  a  partial  cleavage  at  the 
C-terminal,  analogous  to  that  of  mouse  fI-NGF  (CHAPMAN  et al.  1981). 
Furthermore, the C-terminal sequence of guinea pig NGF is  similar to mouse 
NGF in that it ends in Arg-Arg-Gly (SCHWARZ et al.  1989). The primary source 
of esterase  activity in guinea pig prostate does  not appear to form  a  complex 
with fI-NGF (DUNBAR and BRADSHAW 1985). This does not rule out the existence 
of lX- or y-like  subunits in the guinea pig complex, however. 

In contrast, the C-terminals of both bovine and chick NGF differ from  the 
mouse sequence in a way which suggests that these NGFs cannot be processed by 
a y subunit to form a fI-y complex (EBENDAL et al.  1986; MEIER et al.  1986). The 
bovine  NGF  C-terminal  sequence  is  Thr-Gly-Gln  and  the  chicken  NGF 
C-terminal sequence is  Ser-Gly-Pro, neither of which would bind to the active 
site of a y-like enzyme. However, chick embryo NGF is thought to be associated 
with other, unidentified proteins (BELEW and EBENDAL  1986), and bovine NGF 
purified from  seminal vesicles and seminal plasma is found in a  high molecular 
weight form  (HOFFMAN  and UNSICKER  1982;  HARPER  et al.  1982).  The compo(cid:173)
nents of the chick and bovine high molecular weight complexes have not been 
studied. 

Many  cells  in  culture,  including  fibroblasts  and  muscle  and  glial  cells, 
synthesize NGF (BRADSHAW  and YOUNG  1976;  PANTAZIS  1983;  SIMINOSKI  and 
MURPHY  1987; MURPHY et al.  1977a, b; NORRGREN et al.  1980; FURUKAWA et al. 
1984). In addition, several cell types, such as the original S-180 sarcoma cells used 
by  LEVI-MONTALCINI  and  HAMBURGER  (1953),  rat  muscle  cells,  and  mouse 
fibroblasts,  synthesize  high  molecular weight  NGF (KIM  and  PANTAZIS  1985; 
SIMINOSKI and MURPHY  1987;  PANTAZIS et al.  1977;  MURPHY et al.  1977b). The 
high molecular weight form ofNGF from mouse S-180 cells has been shown to 
contain IX  and y subunits (WERRBACH-PEREZ and PEREZ-POLO  1987), but mouse 
fibroblasts  appear  to  contain  fI-NGF-binding  molecules  other  than  lX-NGF 
and y-NGF (PANTAZIS  1983;  SIMINOSKI  and  MURPHY  1987). 

3.5  Comparison of High Molecular Weight NGFs 

Interestingly, all  mammalian high molecular weight NGF complexes are more 
difficult to dissociate than is  mouse 7S  NGF.  Mouse 7S  NGF is  dissociated at 
pH 4;  guinea  pig  and  bovine  high  molecular  weight  NGF dissociate  at pH  3 
(CHAPMAN et al.  1981; HARPER et al.  1982); human placental NGF requires low 
pH and 5 M urea for dissociation (BLUM et al.  1981; PEREZ-POLO et al.  1983); and 

10 

M.  Fahnestock 

Mastomys  NGF dissociates  at pH  3.0  in  the  presence  of urea  (DARLING  and 
FAHNESTOCK  1988).  High  molecular  weight  NGFs  purified  from  mouse  fi(cid:173)
broblasts  and  rat  muscle  cells  in  culture  are  much  more  stable  under  dilute 
conditions than is  submaxillary gland 7S  NGF (PANTAZIS et al.  1977;  MURPHY 
et al.  1977b), indicating that the subunit contacts may differ significantly among 
mouse 7S NGF and other high molecular weight NGFs. Interestingly, a mouse 
submaxillary gland r:t..2Py  complex purified by YOUNG  et al.  (1988) is  also stable 
under  dilute  conditions.  It should  be  noted  that  failure  to  dissociate  a  high 
molecular weight complex may lead to the erroneous conclusion that it contains 
no y-esterase activity, since  this activity is  inhibited in  the complex. 

Although the p-NGFs from a number of sources have been compared at both 
the protein and nucleic acid levels, it is clear that much work remains to be done 
to  clarify  the  differences  between  the  high  molecular  weight  NGFs.  The 
complexes  from  a  variety  of mammalian  tissues  and  cell  types  differ  in  their 
properties. The identification of the non-p components of these complexes will 
require a  great deal more work. 

4  N GF Biosynthesis 

4.1  Transcriptional Regulation 

p-NGF is synthesized in the granular convoluted tubule cells of the submaxillary 
gland of the adult male mouse (CARAMIA et al.  1962; SCHWAB et al.  1976). The r:t.. 
and y subunits have been shown to be present in the same cells (MOWRY  et al. 
1984). All  three subunits of submaxillary gland 7S  NGF are androgen-induced 
(ISACKSON  et al.  1987)  so  that  the  male  submaxillary  gland  produces  larger 
amounts ofNGF than does the female gland. This difference has been reported to 
be  on the  order of 10-fold  (CARAMIA  et al.  1962;  SCOTT  et al.  1983)  to  30-fold 
(ISACKSON  et al.  1987),  and it occurs at the level of transcription.  Furthermore, 
NGF  levels  are  decreased  in  castrated  male  mice  and  are  increased  in 
testosterone-treated female mice (CARAMIA et al.  1962; ISHII and SHOOTER  1975). 
NGF in mouse submaxillary gland is also inducible by thyroxine (ALOE and LEVI(cid:173)
MONTALCINI  1980). 

The difference in the amount ofNGF synthesized between male and female in 
mouse submaxillary gland does not, in general, occur in other species or tissues. 
Relatively high levels ofNGF are found in male and female reproductive organs 
of  several  species  (PEREZ-POLO  et al.  1983;  HARPER  et al.  1982)  and  NGF 
synthesis  is  inducible  by  testosterone  in  mouse  vas  deferens  (GOLDSTEIN  et al. 
1989).  There  is  meager  or  conflicting  evidence  for  androgen  inducibility  of 
p-NGF  in  other  nonreproductive  mouse  tissues,  including  adrenals,  superior 
cervical ganglia, and brain (KORSCHING and THOENEN  1988; KATOH-SEMBA et al. 
1989;  SELBY  et al.  1987b),  and  no  evidence  for  androgen  inducibility  in 

Structure and  Biosynthesis  of Nerve  Growth  Factor 

11 

nonreproductive  tissues  of  other  species,  including  rat  submaxillary  gland 
(HEUMANN et al.  1984). No difference in fJ-NGF levels is found in the Mastomys 
submaxillary  gland;  male  and  female  glands  contain  approximately  the  same 
high  concentrations of fJ-NGF  (ALOE  et al.  1981;  BOWCOCK  et al.  1988). 

NGF is also regulated developmentally (LARGE et al. 1986) and in response to 
injury and tissue explantation (MILLARUELO et al. 1986; SHELTON and REICHARDT 
1986a; HEUMANN  et al.  1987).  Levels  of fJ-NGF protein are correlated with  the 
amounts of fJ-NGF mRNA in a variety of tissues (HEUMANN et al.  1984; SHELTON 
and REICHARDT  1986b). Furthermore the expression of a NGF growth hormone 
fusion  gene  in  transgenic  mice  demonstrates  the  expected  tissue  specificity 
(ALEXANDER  et al.  1989).  Thus,  the  concentration  of NGF  in  target  tissues  is 
generally regulated  at the level  of transcription. 

4.2  Transcription of p-NGF 

The  mouse  fJ-NGF  gene  covers  more  than  43 kb  and  consists  of five  exons 
separated by four introns (Selby et al.  1987b). The NGF gene is present as a single 
copy  in  both  the  mouse  and  human  genomes  and  has  been  localized  to 
chromosome 3 in mouse and to the short arm of chromosome 1 in human (ZABEL 
et al. 1985; FRANCKE et al.  1983). The rat and mouse NGF promoter regions have 
been  identified  (ZHENG  and  HEINRICH  1988);  our  laboratory  has  obtained 
preliminary sequence data for  the human NGF promoter region. 

It was  shown  recently  that  there  are  two  major  and  two  minor  fJ-NGF 
transcripts in mouse (SELBY  et al.  1987b).  The two major transcripts differ  as  a 
result of alternative RNA splicing (EDWARDS  et al.  1986).  One major transcript 
(transcript A,  coding for  the "long" precursor) is  found  primarily in the mouse 
submaxillary gland and in the placenta from  several species,  whereas the other 
major transcript (transcript B, coding for the "short" precursor) is  the predomi(cid:173)
nant form  in  other tissues.  The two  precursors contain the  same  NGF coding 
sequence near their 3' ends. They differ, however, at their 5' ends in that the longer 
transcript  encodes  a  34000  molecular  weight  (MW)  precursor  containing  a 
hydrophobic signal peptide  70  residues  downstream from  the  initiation  meth(cid:173)
ionine, whereas the shorter transcript encodes a 27 000 MW precursor containing 
its  hydrophobic signal peptide at the N-terminal end. 

The  two  minor  transcripts  are  similar  to  the  major  ones.  Transcript  C  is 
similar  to  transcript  A  but is  derived  from  an  independent  promoter  slightly 
upstream of the transcript A promoter; transcript 0  is similar to transcript B but 
appears to have an intron spliced out and may represent a  partially processed 
transcript.  In  mouse  submaxillary  gland,  transcript  A  is  present  in  threefold 
excess over transcript B, whereas in most other tissues transcript B is  present in 
fourfold  excess  over  transcript  A.  In  submaxillary  gland,  transcripts  C  and  0 
comprise  less  than  1%  of NGF  mRNA,  but  in  cortex  and  heart  the  level  of 
transcript  C  is  5%-10%  of  the  total  NGF  mRNA.  In  other  tissues,  both 
transcripts are barely detectable.  The levels  of the major transcripts  change in 

12 

M.  Fahnestock 

parallel  during  postnatal  development,  and  all  transcripts  contain  the  same 
mature  NGF  sequence  at  their  3'  ends;  therefore  the  function  of  several 
precursors and the reasons for the predominance of particular forms  in various 
tissues  are not understood. 

4.3  Translation of p-NGF 

The  f3-NGF  protein is  synthesized  as  a  large  precursor (prepro-NGF)  that  is 
processed at both N- and C-terminal ends into the mature 13 200 MW protein. 
The  long  mRNA  from  mouse  submaxillary  gland  (transcript  A)  uses  a 
methionine  residue at  - 187  as the initiator methionine, producing a precursor 
with a  l\!iW of 33 800; the short mRNA (transcript B),  which is  spliced in such a 
way as to delete methionine - 187, uses a methionine at residue - 121, producing 
a  precursor  with  a  MW  of  27000.  Three  potential  glycosylation  sites  are 
present in  the  f3-NGF  precursor:  two  are  present  in  the  N-terminal  region  of 
pre-f3-NGF  but  not  in  the  mature  protein,  and  one  is  present  in  the  mature 
118 amino acid f3-NGF sequence. Although the glycosylation site is only partially 
utilized in mature f3-NGF (MURPHY et al.  1989), it is not known whether any or 
all  of the  sites  in  the  precursor are  glycosylated  during biosynthesis. 

4.4  Precursor  Processing 

It has proven difficult over the years to study processing of the f3-NGF precursor 
using  immunoprecipitation  of  processed  intermediates  because  antibodies 
directed against mature NGF are seldom able to precipitate the NGF precursor 
or its intermediates, especially those synthesized by cell-free translation systems 
(THOENEN and BARDE 1980; DICOU et al. 1986). Furthermore, although the cDNA 
sequence of mouse f3-NGF  predicts three new pep tides by virtue of processing of 
the precursor at pairs of basic amino acids, generally not all such sites are used 
and other, less  obvious sites  are sometimes cleaved. 

However, a relatively stable NGF precursor of molecular weight 22 000 was 
reported  by  BERGER  and  SHOOTER  (1977).  Using  several  different  antibody 
preparations,  DARLING  et al.  (1983)  identified  a  series  of  f3-NGF  precursors 
including 35000, 29000, 22000, 19000, and 13000 MW species. The 35000 MW 
species  almost certainly  represents  prepro-NGF as  synthesized  from  the  large 
transcript  A;  the  29000 MW species,  although  identified  by DARLING  et al.  as 
perhaps  being  pro-NGF,  could  be  prepro-NGF  synthesized  from  the  small 
transcript B.  The 22 000 and  19000 MW species  probably represent processing 
intermediates arising from cleavage of the NGF precursor at pairs of basic amino 
acids,  specifically  Arg-Arg  at  - 65  and  - 66  and Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg  at residues 
-41 to  -38. 

The mature f3-NGF arises from cleavage following a Lys-Arg (- 2 to  - 1) at 
the N-terminal end and between Arg-Arg at residues  118-119 at the C-terminal 

Structure and  Biosynthesis of Nerve Growth Factor 

13 

end. The order in which processing takes place and the biological activity, if any, 
of the cleaved  peptides have not been determined. 

4.5  The Role of the  r Subunit 

The second subunit ofthe 7S NGF complex, the y subunit, has been implicated in 
the  processing  of the  p-NGF  precursor  (BERGER  and  SHOOTER  1977).  The  y 
subunit is thought to cleave a C-terminal dipeptide from p-NGF, which exposes 
an  arginine  residue  and  thus  permits  the  y subunit  to  bind  to  p-NGF in  the 
complex. Removal of the C-terminal arginine of mature p-NGF prevents binding 
of the  y  subunit  in  the  7S  complex  (GREENE  et al.  1968;  MOORE  et al.  1974; 
BOTHWELL  and SHOOTER  1978). 

It also has been proposed that the y subunit performs the cleavages required 
for  processing  of the  N-terminal  of pro-NGF.  BERGER  and  SHOOTER  (1977) 
demonstrated  cleavage  of the  22000 MW  precursor  species  to  NGF  by  the  y 
subunit.  Although  the EGF binding  protein also  was  capable of carrying out 
these same cleavages, the authors interpreted this result cautiously because the 
precursor probably does not retain its native conformation when isolated as an 
immunoprecipitate  or  after  reduction  with  p-mercaptoethanol  in  urea  and 
denaturation in SDS. In addition, EGF binding protein will not form a complex 
with  native p-NGF (SERVER  and SHOOTER  1976). 

The  y  subunit  also  has  been  shown  to  generate  22000  and  18000 MW 
intermediates  as  well  as  a  small  amount  of  mature  NGF  from  34000  and 
29000 MW  precursors  produced  in vitro  by  wheat  germ  extracts  (JONGSTRA(cid:173)
BILEN et al.  1989). The low yield was attributed to the improper conformation of 
the NGF precursor. 

EDWARDS et al. (1988a, b) have attempted to solve the conformation question 
by expressing the native p-NGF precursor in mammalian cells using a vaccinia 
virus system. They were able to show that both the long and short precursors are 
cleaved to mature p-NGF by stoichiometric amounts of the y subunit. They also 
showed that trypsin in catalytic quantities produces properly processed mature 
NGF  and  that  the  presence  of  oc-NGF  and  zinc  did  not  influence  p~NGF 
precursor cleavage by the y subunit, raising the question of whether this system 
adequately tests for the postulated in vivo specificity.  However, the ability of a 
number of different  cell  lines,  which  do not necessarily  contain  y subunits,  to 
accurately  process  the  p-NGF  precursor calls  into  question  the  specificity  of 
processing  by  y-NGF.  It may  be  that  in vivo  the  specificity  of processing  is 
determined more by enzyme localization than by substrate specificity. 

4.6  Biosynthesis of the  r Subunit 

The biosynthesis of the y subunit has not been studied in detail. It is synthesized 
from  the  mGK-3  gene  (EVANS  and  RICHARDS  1985)  as a  single  chain zymogen 

14 

M.  Fahnestock 

requiring cleavage of an N-terminal peptide for activation, much like chymotry(cid:173)
psin. As discussed in Sect. 2, the y subunit is activated and cleaved internally to 
create two and three chain forms.  The nature of the enzymes that perform the 
zymogen activation and the chain cleavages is unknown, although the amino acid 
sequences  of the  cleavage  sites  suggest  trypsin-like  enzymes,  perhaps  other 
kallikreins. 

4.7  Biosynthesis of the  a  Subunit 

The IX  subunit is synthesized from the mGK-4 gene (EVANS and RICHARDS  1985). 
The prepro-IX subunit migrates as a single chain at 30000 MW, whereas the pro-IX 
subunit, which is glycosylated, migrates at a MW of32 000 (DARLING et al. 1983). 
The pro-IX subunit is cleaved at two sites to produce the mature IX  subunit, which 
consists of 16 000 and 10000 MW chains linked by disulfide bridges, and exists in 
mUltiple  forms  that  differ  in charge.  A  model  (Sect. 2)  has  been  suggested  to 
explain the existence of these forms (ISACKSON et al. 1987). As with the y subunit, 
the enzymes that perform the chain cleavages are unknown. 

Unlike the y subunit, the IX  subunit does  not undergo zymogen activation, 
most likely due to an Arg-to-Gln substitution at residue - 1 and perhaps also due 
to  a  deletion  of four  N-terminal  residues  (ISACKSON  and  BRADSHAW  1984; 
ISACKSON  et ai.  1984).  The  inability  to  undergo  this  cleavage  and  subsequent 
conformational change may account for the IX  subunit's lack of esteropeptidase 
activity. However, there is also a substitution of a glycine residue for a histidine 
near the active site serine and an Asp to Tyr substitution in the binding pocket. 
Whether the active site substitutions, the N-terminal changes, or both contribute 
to the IX  subunit's lack of activity is  unclear. 

4.8  The Role of Other Kallikreins in  NGF Processing 

The IX  and  y subunits belong to a  large family  of trypsin-like  serine  proteases 
known as glandular kallikreins. In the mouse, the kallikreins comprise a family of 
14 active genes and 10 pseudogenes (EVANS et al.  1987), all highly homologous, 
with at least 10 of the 14 active genes expressed in the submaxillary gland. Each of 
the kallikreins displays amino acid differences in the active site region, suggesting 
that  each  kallikrein  has  a  specific  substrate  or  substrates.  The  argument  for 
substrate  specificity  is  strengthened  by experiments  demonstrating  that  EGF 
binding  protein  and  y-NGF-two  very  similar  kallikreins-are  unable  to 
substitute  for  each  other in  their  respective  complexes  (SERVER  and  SHOOTER 
1976).  Further evidence for  strict substrate specificity of these molecules is  the 
inability to assemble complexes  of mouse  and Crotalus subunits (PEREZ-POLO 
et al.  1978).  Therefore,  the  experiments  of EDWARDS  et al.  (1988a, b)  notwith(cid:173)
standing, it is unclear whether in vivo the y subunit carries out all the cleavages 

Structure and  Biosynthesis of Nerve Growth Factor 

15 

required for  the maturation of the fJ-NGF precursor or whether other trypsin(cid:173)
like  enzymes  participate  in  this  processing  in  submaxillary  gland  or  other 
tissues. 

The  study  of  the  biosynthesis  and  substrate  specificities  of  the  various 
kallikreins, particularly the at and y subunits, is complicated by the existence of the 
very  large  and  highly  homologous  kallikrein  family  in  the  mouse  and  by  the 
synthesis  of many  of  these  enzymes  in  the  mouse  submaxillary  gland.  The 
mRNAs  and  the  protein  precursors  of  these  enzymes  migrate  similarly  or 
identically  on gels,  and antibodies  to  one frequently immunoprecipitate other 
members  of the  family  as  well.  In tissues  other  than  the  mouse  submaxillary 
gland, these proteins often are present in extremely small amounts, if at all. It is 
difficult therefore to determine whether, in tissues that contain fJ-NGF, the at and 
y subunits also are present. 

Furthermore, it is  not clear that the y subunit is involved in the C-terminal 
processing of the fJ-NGF precursor in tissues other than the submaxillary gland. 
Although the presence of fJ-NGF has  been demonstrated, y subunits have not 
been  found  in  either  denervated  rat  iris  or  mouse  fibroblast  cells  in  culture 
(MURPHY  et al.  1986;  PANTAZIS  1983).  Other investigators, who  claim  to have 
identified at and/ory subunits in tissues containing fJ-NGF (PANTAZIS and JENSEN 
1985),  particularly  in  studies  using  immunoprecipitation,  often  have  not  ad(cid:173)
dressed the possibility that they have identified another closely related kallikrein. 
Therefore, the apparent lack of a y subunit in many fJ-NGF-synthesizing tissues 
and the ability of other enzymes and a variety of cell lines to correctly process the 
fJ-NGF precursor suggest that other enzymes may function in NGF processing in 
different  species  and tissues. 

4.9  Biosynthesis of NGF from  Mastomys natalensis 

The  functions  of  the  various  subunits  in  the  mouse  high  molecular  weight 
complex and the pathways of biosynthesis ofthese subunits have been difficult to 
illuminate.  This  is  especially  true  for  the  at  subunit,  which  has  no  detectable 
enzymatic or biological activity. The presence of a fJ-y complex in Crotalus snake 
venom affords the opportunity to study a complex in the absence of the at subunit; 
Mastomys allows the study of a complex lacking tightly bound y subunits. The 
differences between these high molecular weight NGF complexes therefore allow 
us a  unique opportunity to study the functions and the importance of all three 
types of subunits involved in NGF action. 

A  cDNA  for  Mastomys 

fJ-NGF  has  been  isolated  and  sequenced 
(FAHNESTOCK and BELL  1988). There are four possible initiation codons for the 
Mastomys fJ-NGF open reading frame.  No information exists on the number of 
fJ-NGF  precursors  in  Mastomys,  but  hydropathicity  analysis  (KYTE  and 
DOOLITTLE  1982) suggests that both methionines  - 183 and - 121 may serve as 
initiation  codons.  By  analogy  with  the  mouse  (EDWARDS  et al.  1986),  the 
Mastomys gene would encode at least two precursors, a short and a long. The 5' 

16 

M.  Fahnestock 

region of Mastomys fJ-NGF cDNA (the sequence upstream of base 157) diverges 
significantly from the mouse sequence; thus, although the short fJ-NG F precursor 
of Mastomys  should  be  very  similar  to  the  mouse  short  precursor,  the  long 
precursors should differ  significantly at their N-terminals. 

The coding region and the 3' untranslated region of Mastomys fJ-NGF cDNA 
share 95% homology with mouse fJ-NGF cDNA. Most major structural features, 
such as histidine and tyrosine residues essential for biological activity, cysteine 
residues, N-linked glycosylation sites, and potential proteolytic cleavage sites, are 
conserved  between mouse  and M astomys.  In  fact,  only 40% of the nucleotide 
differences between the mature fJ-NGFs of Mastomys and mouse result in amino 
acid changes. As in the mouse cDNA, the terminal sequence of the 3' untranslated 
region  of  Mastomys  fJ-NGF  is  exceptionally  A + T  rich  and  contains  a 
polyadenylation signal. 

The Mastomys  fJ-NGF  precursor has the same three C-terminal residues as 
the mouse, suggesting that the Mastomys fJ-NGF precursor could interact with a 
y-like  subunit (see  Sect. 2).  By  analogy with the mouse, a  cleavage following  a 
conserved Lys-Arg at the N-terminal and at the conserved C-terminal site by a 
y-like  enzyme  would  result  in a  118  residue,  mature  Mastomys  fJ-NGF.  This 
choice  of cleavage  sites  is  supported  by  data  demonstrating  comigration  of 
Mastomys 
fJ-NGF  on  SDS-PAGE  (DARLING  and 
FAHNESTOCK  1988). 

fJ-NGF  with  mouse 

The y subunit in mouse has a  function  beyond that of dipeptide  cleavage; 
when complexed to fJ-NG F, it protects fJ-NG F from further degradation (MOORE 
et aI.1974). The lack ofa tightly bound y subunit in Mastomys may have resulted 
in  compensating changes  that make the  Mastomys  fJ-NGF  less  susceptible  to 
degradation. Little is known about the processing of NGF precursors in mouse 
or  Mastomys.  The  kallikrein  family  in  Mastomys  is  very  similar  in  size  and 
sequence homology to the mouse kallikrein family (BOWCOCK et al. 1988). There 
are many kallikreins expressed in the Mastomys submaxillary gland that could 
perform  the  necessary  processing  steps  (BOWCOCK  et al.  1988;  DARLING  and 
FAHNESTOCK 1988). Therefore, the y subunit or y-like proteins could· perform the 
processing steps required for the maturation of Mastomys  fJ-NGF,  but may not 
remain bound as part of the high molecular weight complex. Alternatively, the y 
subunit could be bound more loosely in the M astomys complex than is the mouse 
y  subunit  in  the  7S  complex  and  thus  could  be  lost  more  easily  during  the 
purification procedure. A report of a Mastomys high molecular weight complex 
that exhibits esterase activity (BURCHAM and SHOOTER  1987) supports the latter 
hypothesis. A study of the processing steps involved in fJ-NGF  maturation in a 
variety of tissues and the nature of the subunits in other high molecular weight 
complexes will shed some light on these same questions in the mouse 7S complex.

5  Proteolysis of Mature p-NGF 

Murine  f3-NGF  can  be  stored  in  the  submaxillary  gland  or secreted  into  the 
saliva.  It is  present as  7S  NGF in  both gland and  saliva (BURTON  et al.  1978), 
where  the  environment  contains  many  proteolytic  enzymes  that  can  degrade 
NGF. The  IX  and  y subunits of the  7S  complex  partially  protect f3-NGF  from 
degradation  (MOORE  et aI.  1974;  MOBLEY  et aI.  1976;  NICHOLS  and  SHOOTER 
1985). However, a number of proteolytic modifications commonly are found in 
NGF purified  from  either submaxillary gland  tissue  or saliva,  supporting  the 
hypothesis  that  7S  NGF  exists  in  equilibrium  with  biologically  significant 
amounts of dissociated forms. Degradation of the mature f3  subunit can occur at 
both N- and C-terminal ends. 

5.1  Processing at  the  N-Terminal 

At the N-terminal of mouse f3-NGF, the histidine-methionine site at residues 8-9 
is  cleaved  by  the  enzyme  f3-NGF-endopeptidase  to  liberate  an  N-terminal 
octapeptide  from  mature  f3-NGF  (ANGELETTI  et al.  1973).  Both  the  IX  and  y 
subunits,  when  bound  to  f3-NGF  in  the  7S  complex,  prevent  this  cleavage 
(MOBLEY  et al.  1976;  NICHOLS  and  SHOOTER  1985).  f3-NGF-endopeptidase  is  a 
kallikrein and in the mouse it is coded for by the gene mGK-22 (FAHNESTOCK et al. 
1988; FAHNESTOCK et aI., manuscript submitted). The cleavage carried out by this 
enzyme does not appear to influence  NGF regulation;  des{octa)f3-NGF  exhibits 
biological activity and it will form the 7S complex as readily as full-length NGF 
(MOBLEY  et al.  1976).  Although  the  octapeptide  does  not  exhibit  any  NGF 
activity  (HOGUE-ANGELETTI  et aI.  1974),  recent  studies  indicate  that it  exhibits 
hyperalgesic activity (LEVINE  et al.  1988;  T AIWO  et aI.,  manuscript submitted). 
In  human,  bovine,  and  chicken  NGF,  the  site  at  residue  8-9  is  highly 
conserved as  either His-Met or His-Arg (HARPER  et al.  1982).  The His-Arg site 
also  should  be  susceptible  to  a  kallikrein-like  enzyme,  since  these  enzymes 
generally  cleave  at  basic  residues  such  as  lysine  or  arginine.  However,  no 
des(octa)NGF has  been reported for  these  three  NGFs-possibly because  the 
des(octa)NGF  was  not  sought  or because  the  NGF was  purified  from  tissues 
other than submaxillary gland. The tissue distribution of f3-NGF-endopeptidase 
has not been studied. In mouse, f3-NGF's existence in the des{octa) form in tissues 
other than submaxillary gland is  not known. 

Mastomys  f3-NGF  contains a glutamine residue at position 8 in contrast to 
the  histidine  of  mouse.  The  sequence  change  suggests  that  the  f3-NGF(cid:173)
endopeptidase  cleavage  cannot  take  place,  even  in  the  absence  of  bound  y 
subunit. This hypothesis is  supported by the lack of heterogeneity exhibited by 
the Mastomys  f3-NGF:  Whereas the mouse f3-NGF  consists ofa mixture of full(cid:173)
length  and  des(octa)  species,  Mastomys  NGF exhibits  no  heterogeneity  when 
subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Moreover, the two forms present 

18 

M.  Fahnestock 

in mouse fJ-NGF are detectable on SDS-PAGE, but Mastomys fJ-NGF appears 
as  a  single species (DARLING  and  FAHNESTOCK  1988). 

5.2  Processing at  the  C-Terminal 

Another very  common modification  is  the  removal  of the  C-terminal arginine 
from  the mouse  fJ-NGF  by a  carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme.  The removal of 
this  residue  prevents  fJ-NGF  from  binding  to  the  y-subunit,  because  it  is  this 
arginine  that is  bound by  the  active  site  of the  y subunit (MOORE  et al.  1974). 
However, this modification has no direct effect on the biological activity ofNGF. 
It is the presence of the y subunit, not the  !X  subunit, that protects fJ-NGF  from 
carboxypeptidase digestion (MOBLEY  et al.  1976;  NICHOLS  and SHOOTER  1985). 
Once again, it has been shown from the nucleic acid sequence that other NGFs, 
such  as  bovine  and  human,  have  arginine  residues  capable  of  removal  by  a 
carboxypeptidase;  the  removal  of this  residue  has  only  been  demonstrated  in 
mouse submaxillary gland, however. 

Mastomys  fJ-NGF  has  been  shown  to  be  carboxypeptidase  B-resistant 
(Fig.  1). Originally this was thought to indicate the lack of a C-terminal arginine 
in this species, which could explain the lack of a tightly bound y subunit in the 
Mastomys  5S  complex.  However,  sequence  analysis  of the  Mastomys  fJ-NGF 
cDNA  (FAHNESTOCK  and  BELL  1988)  demonstrated  the  same  C-terminal 
sequence as mouse but with a proline residue substituted for the threonine-117 in 
mouse.  Both  mouse  and  Mastomys  fJ-NGF  proteins  show  identical  charge 
characteristics  on  isoelectric  focusing  gels,  indicating  that  the  most  likely 
sequence for the C-terminal of mature Mastomys fJ-NGF is Pro-Arg-COOH (i.e., a 
processed  form).  This  sequence  should  be  resistant  to  carboxypeptidase  B, 
whereas the mouse sequence, Thr-Arg-COOH, is susceptible to cleavage by this 
enzyme. 

5.3  N G F  in  Blood and  Saliva 

Since  no  differences  in  biological  activity  between  modified  and  unmodified 
NGF  have  yet  been  demonstrated  (MOBLEY  et al.  1976),  the  physiological 
significance of these proteolytic modifications has been unclear. The discovery of 
hyperalgesic activity by the octapeptide (LEVINE et al. 1988) provides a physiolog(cid:173)
ical  reason  for  the  N-terminal  cleavage.  NGF  purified  as  7S  NGF  from 
submaxillary gland  tissue  typically  is  modified  at both N- and C-terminals in 
approximately  10%  of the chains.  In saliva,  approximately  30%  of the  chains 
are  present without an N-terminal octapeptide, while  the  C-terminal  arginine 
has been removed in only 10% of the chains. The 2.5S NGF lacks the N-terminal 
octapeptide 50%  of the time (SERVER  and  SHOOTER  1977). 

In plasma, the NGF dimer is bound to !X2-macroglobulin (RONNE et al.  1979; 
Koo and STACH 1989), but the stage at which the NGF is dissociated from 7S and 

Structure and  Biosynthesis  of Nerve  Growth Factor 

19 

bound to armacroglobulin and the occurrence of further proteolysis in plasma, if 
any,  are unknown. 

5.4  Regulation  of NGF Activity in  the  78 Complex 

In addition to providing protection of {3-NGF from proteolytic modification, the 
7S  complex  also  regulates  the  activity  of the  component  subunits.  In  the  7S 
complex, the biological activity ofNGF is suppressed (STACH and SHOOTER 1980). 
The  mechanism  of this  suppression  is  through  interference,  by  the  a  and  y 
subunits,  with  N G F  binding  to  its  receptor  (HARRIS-WARRICK  et al.  1980; 
NICHOLS  and  SHOOTER  1985).  The  esterase  activity  of  the  y  subunit  is  also 
inactivated by formation of the 7S complex (GREENE et al.  1968; BOTHWELL and 
SHOOTER 1978) due to the occupation of the y subunit active site by the C-terminal 
arginine of {3-NGF. Thus, {3-NGF acts as an active site inhibitor of the y subunit. 

6  Future Prospects 

6.1  The High Molecular Weight Complex 

Mouse submaxillary gland NGF is problematic for a number of reasons. This is 
the only tissue other than M astomys submaxillary gland and snake venom gland, 
both related tissues, in which NGF is found in such high quantities. It is also the 
only mammalian tissue in which the high molecular weight complex has been well 
characterized. There are two essential questions: Do the a and y subunits function 
only in a storage capacity in this tissue? In other tissues with much lower levels of 
NGF, do  these subunits exist or have any  physiological significance? 

It is possible that in tissues synthesizing small amounts of {3-NGF, there are 
also small amounts of a- or y-like subunits that may bind to NGF and function in 
its  regulation.  Clearly,  the  binding of such proteins to {3-NGF  can  regulate its 
biological activity through the inhibition of receptor binding and can prevent the 
degradation of {3-NGF by tissue proteases. The suggestion that other tissues, for 
example, bovine seminal vesicles, human placenta, chick embryo, and guinea pig 
prostate,  may  contain  molecules  that  bind  {3-NGF  leaves  the  role  of  high 
molecular weight NGF in regulating NGF activity uncertain for the time being. 

6.2  Processing of ft-NGF 

Another question that currently remains unanswered is the role ofthe y subunit in 
the processing of the {3-NGF precursor.  Although recent experiments demons(cid:173)
trate the ability of the y subunit to correctly process pro-{3-NGF at both N- and 

20 

M.  Fahnestock 

C-terminal ends,  the apparent lack  of a  y subunit in many  NGF-synthesizing 
tissues  and  the  ability  of trypsin  to  correctly  process  the  fJ-NGF  precursor 
suggest that other enzymes may function in NGF processing in different tissues. 
Finally,  the large  family  of kallikreins  in  the mouse,  to  which  the  r:J.  and  y 
subunits belong, is puzzling. The highly selective substrate specificities of these 
kallikreins, exemplified  by  the inability of the  y subunit and the EGF binding 
protein  to  substitute  for  each  other  in  their  respective  complexes,  led  to  the 
suggestion that these enzymes function in the highly selective processing of their 
hormone  substrates.  This  finding  contrasts· with  the  fact  that  other  species, 
humans in particular, appear to have a much smaller kallikrein family.  Human 
kallikreins  therefore must have  broader substrate specificity,  less  redundancey 
than is proposed for the mouse, or must not function pivotally in the processing of 
a  variety  of hormone  precursors.  Furthermore,  there  may  be  a  great  deal  of 
redundancy in the  activity  of the mouse  kallikreins,  with  substrate  specificity 
determined  largely  by  tissue  distribution.  The  answers  to  these  and  other 
questions may best be discovered by studying the biosynthesis, processing, and 
regulation  of NGF in  tissues  and  species  other  than  the  mouse  submaxillary 
gland. 

7  Summary 

Most of our knowledge about NGF comes from  extensive study of the mouse 
submaxillary gland protein. NGF from this source is isolated as a high molecular 
weight complex consisting of fJ-NGF and two subunits, r:J.  and y, belonging to the 
kallikrein family  of serine proteases. There are few  other tissues  where NGF is 
found  in sufficient quantities for  protein purification and study, although new 
molecular  biological  techniques  have  accelerated  the  study  of NGFs  from  a 
variety of species and tissues. 

Mouse submaxillary gland NGF is  synthesized as a large precursor that is 
cleaved at both N- and C-terminals to produce mature NGF. This biologically 
active molecule can be further cleaved by submaxillary gland proteases. The roles 
ofthe r:J.  and y subunits in the processing of the fJ-NGF precursor, the modulation 
of the biological activity of fJ-NGF, and the protection of mature fJ-NGF from 
degradation have been well studied in the mouse. However, the apparent lack of r:J. 
and y subunits in most other tissues and species and the existence of a large family 
of murine kallikreins, many of which  are expressed in the submaxillary gland, 
challenge the relevance of murine high molecular weight NGF as a proper model 
for  NGF biosynthesis and regulation. It is  important therefore to identify and 
characterize  other  NGF  complexes  and  to  study  their  subunit  interactions, 
biosynthesis, processing, and regulation. 

This  review  points out a  number of other species and tissues  in  which  the 
study  of NGF  has just  begun.  At  this  time,  there  exist  many  more  questions 

Structure and  Biosynthesis  of Nerve Growth Factor 

21 

than answers  regarding the presence and the functions  of NGF processing and 
regulatory proteins. By studying NGF in other species and tissues and comparing 
the processing and regulation ofNGF from several sources, we will discover the 
unifying  concepts  governing the expression  of NGF biological  activity.

1  Introduction 

Neurotrophic factors are required for regulation of cell division, cell death, axon 
outgrowth and synapse formation during fetal development, maintenance of the 
adult  nervous  system,  and  neural  regeneration  following  injury.  Due  to  the 
relative abundance of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the murine salivary gland, 
NGF was  the first  neurotrophic factor  to be isolated and characterized (LEVI(cid:173)
MONTALCINI  1987). 

The  NGF  receptor  was  detected  by  125I_NGF  binding  studies,  but initial 
attempts to determine the molecular identity of the receptor were confusing and 
contradictory.  Recently,  the  NGF  receptor  was  identified  using  anti-receptor 
monoclonal antibodies (MAb), and the gene for the receptor was cloned. In this 
article,  we  review  these  recent  advances  and  then  focus  on  current  problems 
concerning  NGF  receptor  structure  and  its  possible  role  in  neural-related 
tumors.

2  NGF 

NGF is a 26 kDa polypeptide neurotrophic factor capable of mediating a variety 
of biological  responses  (LEVI-MoNTALCINI  1987).  Serum  levels  are  quite  low 
(STEPHANI et al. 1987) suggesting that this factor is synthesized at its site of action. 
It acts  as  a  survival  factor  for  sympathetic  and sensory  neurons  both  in  vivo 
(JOHNSON  et al.  1980) and in culture (HERRUP  and SHOOTER  1975) and also can 
act  as  a  chemoattractant  (LEVI-MoNTALCINI  1976).  In  addition,  NGF  is  a 
differentiation  factor  for  the  pheochromocytoma cell  line,  PC12  (GREENE  and 
TISCHLER  1976),  neuroblastomas (SONNENFELD  and ISHII  1982),  fetal  peripheral 
neurons  (COLLINS  and  DAWSON  1983),  fetal  brain  cholinergic  neurons  (HEFTI 
et al.  1986),  and fetal  adrenal chromaffin cells  (LILLIEN  and CLAUDE  1985)  and 
may  have  similar effects  in  vivo  (LEVI-MoNTALCINI  and  ALOE  1985;  GOEDERT 
et al.  1984). The innervated organs provide a source ofNGF for NGF dependent 
neurons, and during development competition for NGF may regulate neuronal 
cell death (PURVES and LICHTMAN  1985). Although NGF was originally named a 
growth factor, its role as a mitogen is  very limited, and there is no evidence that 
NGF acts in vivo as a mitogen. PC12 cells cease to divide after exposure to NGF, 
although  a  variant  of  PC12  cells  (BURSTEIN  and  GREENE  1982)  grows  cont(cid:173)
inuously in response to NGF. Fetal chromaffin cells (LILLIEN and CLAUDE  1985) 
divide several times in response to NGF before terminally differentiating. Some 
neuroblastoma  cell  lines  differentiate  in  response  to  NGF,  but  there  is 
disagreement whether cell  division stops (PEREZ-POLO  et al.  1979; SONNENFELD 
and ISHII  1982). 

3  Binding Studies with  NGF 

Binding  studies  with  125I_NGF  have  demonstrated  the  presence  of  specific 
receptors on the surface of a variety of cell types, particularly those of neural crest 
origin  (VALE  and  SHOOTER  1985).  Such  receptors  are  found  on  all  NGF(cid:173)
responsive cells,  such  as  sensory  and sympathetic neurons,  neuroblastoma cell 
lines, and the rat PC12 cell line (Table 1). Detailed analysis of 125I_NGF binding 
generally shows that receptors are heterogeneous with  regard to NGF binding 
properties, and most studies have concluded that there are two forms of the NGF 
receptor, differing in their affinity for  NGF and in the rate with which they bind 
and release NGF. The low- and high-affinity  receptors bind NGF with a  Kd  of 
about 2 nM and 0.2 nM, respectively, and the difference in affinity is primarily due 
to the slower off-rate of the high-affinity  receptor.  Also,  the two  receptor types 
differ in their sensitivity to proteases and in their solubility in nonionic detergents 
(SCHECHTER  and  BOTHWELL  1981 ;  VALE  et al.  1985).  The  high-affinity  NG F 
receptor appears to be largely responsible for  NGF internalization and for  the

differentiating response  in  PC12 cells  (GREEN  et al.  1986).  As judged by dose(cid:173)
response curves,  NGF-induced modulation of PC12 tyrosine hydroxylase and 
amino acid transport activities are mediated by both low- and high-affinity NGF 
receptors (KEDES et al.  1982; ROWLAND et al.  1987). For bovine chromaffin cells 
which lack high-affinity sites, tyrosine hydroxylase activity is modulated by low(cid:173)
affinity  sites (ACHESON  et al.  1984).  Schwann.cells which  have only low-affinity 
NGF  receptors  display  altered  levels  of  the  cell-cell  adhesion  molecule  L1 
following exposure to NGF (SEILHEIMER  and SCHACHNER  1987). 

4  Biochemical Characterization of the  NGF Receptor 

Initial biochemical characterization ofNGF receptors led to a confusing variety 
of putative receptor forms.  Hydrodynamic studies of the detergent-solubilized 
receptor of rabbit superior cervical ganglia revealed a highly asymmetric 135 kDa 
molecule  (COSTRINI  et al.  1979).  Chemical  cross  linking of 125I_NGF  to  these 
receptors revealed forms of 130 kDa and 100 kDa (MASSAGUE et al. 1982). Similar 
cross-linking studies on rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells led to receptor forms 
of 135-145kDa and  107-117kDa, (MASSAGUE  et al.  1982),  while  cross-linking 
characterization  of substantially  purified  receptor  from  A875  melanoma  cells 
revealed receptors of 70-90 kDa and 180-200 kDa (GROB et al. 1983; PUMA et al. 
1983).  The cause of this  confusion is  still  not clear. 

A critical advance was the development of murine MAbs directed against the 
human  melanoma  NGF receptor (Ross  et al.  1984)  and  against  the  rat  NGF 
receptor (CHANDLER  et al.  1984).  Intact  human  melanoma cells  and  detergent 
solubilized PC12 membranes were used as immunogens for the anti-human and 
anti-rat receptor MAbs, respectively. The former MAbs were prepared as part of 
a large program to develop anti-tumor MAbs and were not initially recognized as 
anti-NGF  receptor  MAbs  (HERLYN  et al.  1983).  We  focused  on  these  MAbs

because  of their  preferential  binding  to  cell  lines  rich  in  NGF  receptor  and 
determined that these MAbs block binding of 12SI_NGF to melanoma cells and 
immunoprecipitate  125I-NGF- NGF receptor complexes prepared by  chemical 
cross-linking with ethyldimethylisopropylaminocarbodiimide (Ross et al.  1984). 
The  anti-rat  receptor  MAb  also  immunoprecipitates  the  125I-NGF- NGF 
receptor  complex  but  does  not  inhibit  binding  of  12SI_NGF  to  PC12  cells. 
However, the MAb does inhibit NGF-induced neurite formation  by  PC12 cells 
(CHANDLER  et al.  1984).  Also,  this  MAb  is  retrogradely  transported  by  nerve 
axons in a manner similar to that known for NGF (TANIUCHI and JOHNSON  1985). 
Both MAbs are highly species-specific. The MAbs prepared against human cells 
bind to human or monkey cells  (MARANO  et al.  1987)  but not to lower species. 
MAb 192 binds to rat NGF receptor but not to chick, mouse, or human receptors. 
Initial studies revealed  that both MAbs react to the same antigen, a 75 kDa 
protein as determined by SDS-PAGE (GROB  et al.  1985; TANIUCHI  et al.  1986). 
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of CSS] cysteine labeled receptor revealed 
that  the  receptor  was  a  heterogeneous,  acidic  protein  (Fig.  1)  suggesting  post 
translational modifications of the receptor.  We  have identified at least two  and 
probably three such modifications.  Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that the 
receptor is initially synthesized as a 62 kDa protein and undergoes a tunicamycin 
sensitive modification within the firs t 30- 60 min following synthesis. This step is 
clearly  N-linked  glycosylation.  There follows  a  slower  tunicamycin  insensitive 
step which is probably O-linked glycosylation. Sequencing of the corresponding 
cDNA (see Chapt. 4) revealed a serine, threonine rich region which is character(cid:173)
istic ofO-linked glycosylation sites. However, there is no direct chemical evidence 
that there  really  is O-linked  glycosylation.

In  both  human  (GROB  et al.  1985)  and  rat  cells  (TANIUCHI  et al.  1986), 
the receptor is  phosphorylated (Fig. 2).  The receptor is  mainly  phosphorylated 
on  serine  residues  but  there  is  also  a  small  amount  of  phosphorylation  of 
threonine  residues.  Peptide  mapping  revealed  that  the  phosphorylation  is 
confined to two tryptic peptides. The more hydrophobic peptide accounted for 
most of the phosphoserine, and the more hydrophilic peptide had small amounts 
of both  phosphoserine  and  phosphothreonine  (TANIUCHI  et al.  1986).  Neither 
the  identity  of the  kinase  responsible  for  phosphorylation  of the  receptor  nor 
the  function  of the  phosphorylation is  known.  The  extent  of phosphorylation 
is  not effected  by  NGF treatment or by  phorbol esters, and the  isolated  NGF 
receptor  has  no  phosphorylation  activity  (T ANIUCHI  et al.  1986;  MARANO 
et al.  1987).  Since  protein  phosphorylation  is  usually  regulatory  the  exact 
function of this modification will probably have to await a  better understanding 
of the  mechanism  by  which  NGF receptor  triggers  neuronal  differentiation. 

Analysis ofNGF receptor by SDS-PAGE results in at least two bands (GROB 
et al.  1985).  The  major  bands  are  75  and  200kDa,  but  there  are  sometimes 
minor bands of even higher apparent molecular mass. Utilizing two-dimensional 
SDS-PAGE,  in  which  the  first  dimension  was  nonreducing  and  the  second 
reducing,  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  higher  molecular  mass  bands  are 
multimers  of  the  75 kDa  protein  band.  It  is  not  known  what  the  state  of 
aggregation  of  the  receptor  is  in  intact  biological  membranes.  This  is  an 
important question since ligand-induced aggregation  has been shown to  be an 
important step in the response of other cell surface receptors (SCHLESSINGER  1986; 
METZGER  et al.  1986). 

32 

A. H.  Ross et al. 

To allow  a  more detailed  chemical  study,  the  NGF receptor  was  isolated 
from  cultured  human  melanoma  cells  by  a  combination  of  lectin  affinity 
chromatography  and  immunoaffinity  chromatography  (MARANO  et al.  1987). 
A single 75 kDa protein species was detected which bound the anti-NGF receptor 
MAbs  and  NGF.  Hence,  this  was  the  correct  protein,  and  no  other  protein 
component is  required for specific NGF binding. The isolated receptor protein 
was  used  for  two  applications.  First,  this  material  was  used  as  an  efficient 
immunogen to generate more anti-receptor MAbs (MARANO et al. 1987). Many of 
these new  MAbs have  properties similar to the original MAbs suggesting that 
there may be an immunodominant epitope.  Second, the isolated receptor was 
subjected  to  microsequencing  of the  N-terminus  (MARANO  et al.  1987).  This 
sequence is  very similar to the corresponding sequence generated from  the  rat 
NGF receptor and was useful for cloning of the NGF receptor gene (CHAO et al. 
1986; JOHNSON  et al.  1986;  RADECKE  et al.  1987). 

5  Future  Directions 

The  identity  of the  high-affinity  NGF receptor is  a  central  focus  of the  field. 
HOSANG  and  SHOOTER  (1987)  reported  that  the' high-affinity  receptor  was  a 
140 kDa protein distinct from the 75 kDa receptor, but GREEN and GREENE (1986) 
could not reproducibly detect the second protein and presented strong evidence 
that  the  75 kDa  protein  (gp75)  was  a  component  of both  the  low- and  high(cid:173)
affinity receptors. These data are reinforced by the finding that the anti-rat NGF 
receptor MAb inhibits NGF-induced neurite extension (CHANDLER  et al.  1984) 
and that gp75  on some neuroblastoma cells is  high affinity (CHAO  et al.  1986). 
Also,  anti-gp75  antibodies  prepared  against  synthetic  peptides  inhibit  neurite 
extension by  PC12 cells (EVELETH  and BRADSHAW  1988). 

Given the strong evidence for a role of gp75 in the high-affinity binding site, 
the question becomes what modification of gp75 results in high-affinity binding. 
There are three models currently under consideration. First, gp75 might undergo 
a  conformational change  or a  change in lateral association (PUMA  et al.  1983) 
perhaps  analagous  to  the  insulin-like  growth  factor  I  receptor for  which  the 
receptor monomer binds insulin-like growth factor  I  with  low  affinity  and the 
receptor dimer binds insulin-like growth factor I  with high affinity (TOLLEFSEN 
and THOMPSON  1988).  There  is  surprisingly  little  data  concerning  the  state  of 
aggregation of membrane-bound NGF receptor although detergent solubilized 
receptors tend to form  a  mixture of monomers and dimers (GROB  et al.  1985). 
Second, there might be a second NGF binding protein in cells with high-affinity 
receptors. The high-affinity receptor is proposed to be a heterodimer of the two 
NGF  binding  proteins.  This  model  gained  great  popularity  following  the 
discovery  of a  second  binding  protein  for  interleukin-2  (TESHIGAWARA  et al. 
1987),  but  now  after  efforts  by  many  laboratories  the  second  NGF  binding 

Biochemical Characterization in Neural-Related Tumors

protein has not been reproducibly detected. In the third model, the high-affinity 
receptor is proposed to be a heterodimer of gp75 with a modulator protein which 
does  not bind NGF but rather enhances  the affinity  of gp75  for  NGF.  Such  a 
modulator  protein  might  be  difficult  to  detect  particularly  if  the  association 
occurs between transmembrane domains or intracellular domains.  For the IgE 
receptor, the IgE binding subunit was easily detected, but other components of 
the receptor were discovered only after years of additional study (METZGER et al. 
1986). 

The  mechanism  of NGF  receptor  action  is  poorly  understood.  There  are 
many biochemical changes immediately following  NGF stimulation (Y ANKNER 
and SHOOTER  1982),  but the  primary action  of the  receptor is  not known.  The 
receptor  is  not  a  protein  kinase,  and  the  sequence  of  the  receptor  is  not 
significantly  homologous  to  any  known  enzyme.  Recently,  MAHER  (1988) 
reported  that  NGF treatment of pe12 cells  induced  phosphotyrosine-bearing 
proteins.  These  results  are  very  important  since  a  connection  between  the 
receptor  and  a  tyrosine-specific  kinase  might  allow  the  first  biochemical 
delineation  of the mechanism  of NGF receptor  action. 

6  Expression of NGF Receptor  by  Neural-Related Tumors 

Due to the paucity of material available from  primary neural cultures, virtually 
all  of the biochemical studies of the NGF receptor have utilized  neural-related 
tumors. A wide variety of neural-related tumors express NGF receptor (Table 2). 
Although melanomas do  not display  a  neuronal  phenotype they  are  of neural

crest  origin.  Melanoma cell  lines  have  been  of particular utility  because some 
of  these  lines  express  unusually  large  numbers  of  NGF  receptors  (Table  1). 
However,  there is  only  a  slight  biological  response  by  these  cell  lines  to  NGF 
(FABRICANT  et al.  1977).  Neuroblastoma  cell  lines  vary  in  NGF  receptor 
expression.  Neuroepithelioma  cell  line  MCIXC  expresses  large  numbers  of 
receptors  but  is  apparently  nonresponsive  (SONNENFELD  and  ISHII  1985). 
Neuroblastoma cell line SY5Y has very few  receptors, but these are high-affinity 
sites.  This line  responds  to  NGF by  neurite  extension  but does  not  cease  cell 
division  (SONNENFELD  and  ISHII  1982).  Many  freshly  excised  neuroblastomas 
apparently  lack  NGF  receptor  but  the  more  differentiated  ganglioneuromas 
are  receptor  positive  (CHESA  et al.  1988).  Short-term  cultures  of  human 
pheochromocytomas  differentiate  and  cease  cell  division  in  response  to  NGF 
(TISCHLER et al.  1980). Ewing's sarcoma was assigned as a neural-derived tumor 
based  on expression  of neural  markers  such  as  NGF  receptor  (LIPINSKI  et al. 
1987),  but  there  is  not  report  of  a  Ewing's  sarcoma  biological  response  to 
NGF.  Two  other  small  round  cell 
tumors,  embryonal  and  synovial 
rhabdomyosarcomas,  are  also  positive  (CHESA  et al.  1988).  Neurofibromas 
express  the low-affinity  NGF receptor and do  not have any  apparent response 
to  NGF  (PLEASURE  et al.  1986;  Ross  et al.  1986;  SONNENFELD  et al.  1986); 
Schwannomas are also  positive. In unpublished studies, we  have demonstrated 
that medulloblastoma cell lines express NGF receptor (BAKER et aI., unpublished 
work).  The  affinity  of the medulloblastoma NGF receptor and the response of 
these  cells  to NGF is  not known. 

The origin of the widespread expression of NGF receptor by neural-related 
tumors  is  not  clear.  Overexpression  of the  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor 
frequently involves amplification of the receptor gene. We have screened a series 
of melanoma cell lines which strongly express NG F  receptor at the protein and 
RNA levels.  Southern blot analysis show no amplification or apparent modific(cid:173)
ation  of  the  NGF  receptor  gene  (Fig. 3).  The  regulation  of  NGF  receptor 
expression  may  be  quite  complex.  The  promotor is  apparently  constituitively 
active  and  regulation  is  due  to  other  genetic  elements  (SEHGAL  et al.  1988). 
Frequently,  tumors  express  antigens  associated  with  fetal  development,  i.e. 
oncofetal antigens.  Since NGF receptor is expressed most strongly during fetal 
development (YAN and JOHNSON 1987; SCARPINI et al. 1988), it might be expressed 
simply  as  part  of the  shift  to  the  oncofetal  program  of gene  expression.  It is 
intriguing to consider a causal role for  NGF receptor overexpression in tumor 
formation,  but  there  is  little  supporting  evidence.  NGF  has  been  reported  to 
induce  sustained  cell  proliferation  in  only  one  case,  a  variant  PC12  subline 
(BURSTEIN and GREENE  1982). Also, there is no known pattern of coexpression of 
NGF and NGF receptor by  neural-related  tumors. 

In normal development,  NGF induces  terminal differentiation, and lack  of 
NGF  induces  cell  death.  Hence,  a  more  reasonable  hypothesis  is  that  the 
activation of an  oncogene  retards  the cell  differentiation  normally induced  by 
NGF and other factors and, thereby, contributes to tumor formation. In a series 
of infant autopsies, a high frequency of adrenal lesions histologically identical to

neuroblastomas  was  observed  (BECKWITH  and  PERRIN  1963).  In  view  of  the 
known clinical incidence  of neuroblastoma, the  majority of these  lesions  must 
differentiate  during  normal  growth  and  development.  Hence,  neuroblastomas 
may mimic a normal stage offetal development, and factors which induce normal 
differentiation  may  have  therapeutic  potential.  The  development  of  such 
therapeutic  approaches  is  particularly  urgent  for  childhood  tumors  such  as 
neuroblastoma. Physicians treating newborn patients are severely limited in the 
doses  of radiotherapy  and  chemotherapy.  NGF  is  a  potent  stimulus  for  cell 
differentiation but it is also a "sticky" molecule which may be difficult to deliver to

which  NGF acts  and to develop  new  drugs  to  control this  pathway.

1  Introduction 

Receptors  for  mammalian  growth  factors  are  integral  membrane  proteins 
designed to have multiple functions for communicating with other cells and for 
intracellular signal transduction.  These cell  surface  proteins have  binding sites 
for  the ligand that face  the external environment and also an effector site that 
generates  a  biological  signal  within  the  cell.  For nerve  growth  factor  (NGF), 
the interaction with its cell surface receptor leads to a remarkable set of reactions 
in  responsive  cells,  including changes  in  gene  expression,  activation of neuro(cid:173)
transmitter enzymes, and stimulation of neuronal processes. These many events 
lead  ultimately  to  the  survival  and  maintenance  of  selective  neuronal  cell 
populations. 

The  cloning  of  the  NGF  receptor  gene  has  provided  new  insights  into 
receptor structure, expression, and distribution. As a growth factor receptor, the 
NGF  receptor  is  unlike  other  receptors  containing  inherent  tyrosine  kinase 
activities.  This  chapter  will  review  the  structural  and  genetic  features  of the 
NGF  receptor  and  its  role  in  transmitting  the  intracellular  signals  of NGF. 
Several lines of evidence suggest that the signal transduction mechanism ofNGF

involves  interaction  of  the  receptor  with  a  second,  auxiliary  protein.  The 
availability of genetic probes for the NGF receptor now allows investigation of 
the regulation of receptor expression and correlation of the structural features of 
the receptor with its functional  consequences. 

2  Cloning of the  NGF Receptor  Gene 

Two techniques contributed tremendously to the cloning of the NGF receptor 
gene: (I) the use of gene transfer and (2) the ability to detect NGF receptor using 
monoclonal antibodies. DNA-mediated gene transfer was used as an assay for the 
expression cloning of the NGF receptor (CHAO et al.  1986; RADEKE et al.  1987). 
Stable transformation of cultured cells with total genomic DNA had previously 
allowed for the isolation and characterization of human oncogenes and selectable 
genes such as  those for  thymidine kinase,  adenine phosphoribosyl transferase, 
and hypoxanthine  phosphoribosyl  transferase.  This  method  circumvented  the 
requirement  for  mRNA  enrichment  or  for  protein  purification  and  thus 
allowed for  the isolation of a gene whose product is expressed at relatively low 
levels. 

Since  expression  of  cell  surface  receptors  is  not  amenable  to  metabolic 
selection, transfer of the gene encoding the NGF receptor required cotransfection 
with genes carrying selectable markers. High molecular weight DNA was mixed 
with  the  purified  herpes  virus  thymidine  kinase  gene  to  produce  a  calcium 
phosphate precipitate. This precipitate was  used  to transfect mouse fibroblasts 
deficient  in  thymidine  kinase  (tk -).  After  2 weeks  hypoxanthine-aminopterin(cid:173)
thymidine  (HAT)  selection,  tk +  colonies  were  screened  for  NGF  receptor 
expression  by  an  in situ  rosette  assay  employing  the  ME20A  monoclonal 
antibody (CHAo et al.  1986), which inhibits NGF binding to NGF receptors on 
human melanoma cells (Ross et al.  1984), or by cell sorting (RADEKE et al.  1987) 
using the 192-IgG monoclonal antibody against the rodent receptor (CHANDLER 
et al.  1984). The identification and availability of these antibodies were essential 
to the success  of the gene  transfer approach. 

Two different routes were taken to isolate the NGF receptor gene following 
gene transfer and purification of the fibroblast transfectants. The first was to use a 
molecular tag to rescue the phenotype-transforming sequences, and the second 
approach was to employ subtracted cDNA from transfected cells. Human NGF 
receptor  sequences  were  isolated  from  a  transfected  mouse  L  cell  line  using 
human middle  repetitive  Alu sequences  as  a  probe (CHAO  et al.  1986).  The  rat 
NGF receptor gene was isolated following cDNA subtractive hybridization. Poly 
(A)+  RNA from  the L  cell  transfectant was converted to e2 p]cDNA, and  the 

unique cDNA sequences were isolated after hybridization with RNA from  tk(cid:173)
cells.  This enriched cDNA was used  to identify a full-length  rat NGF receptor 
clone (RADEKE  et al.  1987). 

The  Membrane  Receptor for  Nerve  Growth Factor 

41 

The  validity  of  the  receptor  sequence  deduced  from  cDNA  clonign  was 
verified  by  gas  phase  sequencing  of NGF  receptor  protein  purified  from  the 
melanoma  A875  cell  line  (MARANO  et al.  1987);  by  cDNA  expression  in 
mammalian cells (JOHNSON et al.  1986; RADEKE et al.  1987); and by expression in 
Xenopus  laevis  oocytes  microinjected  with  receptor  mRNA  produced  in vitro 
(SEHGAL  et al.  1988a). 

The  3.8  kilobase  mRNA  for  the  NGF receptor  contains  a  5'  untranslated 
sequence of 120 bases and a large 3' untranslated region of nearly 2 kilo bases. The 
3' sequence is  uninterrupted and is  contained in the largest  receptor ex on (2.3 
kilo bases) together with sequences representing the intracellular domain of the 
receptor (see below). The significance of such an extensive 3' untranslated region 
is unknown, but long noncoding sequences have been detected in the mRNAs of 
many  genes  encoding  cell  surface  molecules.  The  receptor  mRNA  contains  a 
single polyadenylation sequence, ATT AAA, nine bases upstream from a poly(A) 
tail. No other polyadenylation sites have been uncovered for the receptor mRNA. 

3  Structural  Features of the  NGF Receptor 

Complementary  cDNAs  representing  the  NGF  receptor  mRNA  have  been 
isolated for chicken, rat, and humans by screening cDNA libraries from chicken 
brain (HEUER et al.  1990; LARGE et al.  1989), transfected fibroblasts (RADEKE et al. 
1987),  and  human  A875  melanoma  cells  (JOHNSON  et al.  1986).  Full-length 
receptor  cDNAs predict a  signal  sequence  of 28  amino  acids;  an extracellular 
domain  containing  four  40  amino  acid  repeats  with  six  cysteine  residues  at 
conserved positions, followed  by a  region rich in threonine and serine residues; 
a  single  transmembrane  domain;  and  a  155  amino  acid  cytoplasmic  domain. 
The molecular  weight of the fully  processed  receptor  protein is  approximately 
70-80000.  The  difference  between  the  size  of  the  mature  receptor  and  the 
predicted size  of the  receptor  protein (399  amino acids)  is  due  to extensive  0-
and N-linked  glycosylation (see  Ross,  this  volume). 

A comparison of the amino  acid sequences of the  human,  rat,  and chicken 
NGF receptors is displayed in Fig.  1.  The rat NGF receptor sequence (RADEKE 
et al.  1987)  shares  92~~ homology  on  the  amino  acid  level  with  the  human 
receptor, whereas the chicken NGF receptor is less conserved (HEUER et al.  1990; 
LARGE et al. 1989). It is noteworthy that nearly every cysteine residue is conserved 
and  that  the  transmembrane  region  is  especially  well-conserved  between  the 
three  species. 

Most of the differences in amino acid sequence between the human and rat 
receptors are conservative changes.  However,  several differences  which change 
the net charge of the receptor may account for the extreme species specificity of 
monoclonal antibodies  against  the  receptor.  For example,  some  of the mono(cid:173)
clonal antibodies against the human receptor are effective at blocking the binding

acids of the human NGF receptor are displayed. This region has been divided into four segments of

cysteine residues  in  this domain

ofNGF to the human receptor; however, they do not recognize the rat or chicken 
receptor.  Undoubtedly,  the  differences  in  amino  acid  sequence  in  the  putative 
extracellular  domain  contribute  to  the  species  specificity  of the  anti-rat  and 
-human monoclonal antibodies. 

One of the most striking features of the receptor amino acid sequence are the 
28  cysteine  residues,  24  of which  are found  within  the first  160  residues  of the 
receptor  (Fig. 2).  Alignment  of  the  cysteine  residues  indicates  that  they  are 
contained in four 40 amino acid internal repeats that have many similar residues 
besides the cysteine residues. These internal repeats have lead to the hypothesis 
that these units are evolutionarily related. Similar cysteine rich repeats have been 
detected  in  the  extracellular  domains  of a  number  of  proteins  including  cell 
surface  proteins  such  as  the  tumor  necrosis  factor  receptor  (LOETSCHER  et al. 
1990; SCHALL et al.  1990; SMITH et al.  1990), CDw40 (STAMENKOVIC et al.  1989), T 
cell antigens (KWON and WEISSMAN  1989; MALLET et al.  1990) and a Shope viral 
protein (UPTON  et al.  1987). 

The  pattern  of cysteine  repeats  found  in  these  cell  membrane  proteins  is 
shown  in  Fig.  3.  It is  likely  that  the  NGF receptor  is  oriented  with  the  NH 2-
terminal region outside the cell, and the COOH-terminal in  the cytoplasm. Since 
the  cysteine  repeats  constitute  70%  of the  extracellular  portion  of  the  NGF 
receptor, this domain probably constitutes part or all of the binding site for NGF. 
The extracellular sequence is also distinguished by its highly negative charge. 
The bulk of the negative charge is  contributed by  the cysteine  rich  domain in 
which the net charge is  - 24, consistent with the acidic pI of the receptor (GROB 
et al. 1985). No charged amino acids are found in residues 223-244 which have all 
the  characteristics  of a  transmembrane  domain.  This  hydrophobic  segment  is 
followed  by  several  basic amino acids  which  commonly  mark the cytoplasmic 
border  of  the  membrane  spanning  region.  Receptors  for  asialoglycoprotein, 
transferrin, EGF, interleukin-l, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, and platelet derived 
growth factor (PDGF) also  contain a  single  transmembrane domain.

Though  the  deduced  amino  acid  sequence  of the  human  NGF  receptor 
reveals structural features in common with other receptors whose structures have 
been elucidated, the NGF receptor lacks significant amino acid similarities with 
any other known receptor or protein. In particular, the primary sequence of the 
intracellular domain does not display any similarities to known growth factors, 
oncogenes,  or tyrosine  kinase  gene  family.  This  lack  of homology  to  known 
tyrosine kinases is consistent with the absence of tyrosine kinase activity by the 
NGF receptorfrom human melanoma cells (GROB et al. 1985), PC 12 cells, and rat 
superior  cervical  ganglia  (TANIUCHI  et al.  1986a)  and  in  spite  of reports  that 
tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in NGF-treated PC12 cells (MAHER  1988). The 
lack of similarity between the NGF receptor and the tyrosine kinase family  of 
receptors is not unexpected since the primary target cells influenced by NGF do 
not undergo cell division in response to the hormone. The absence of such activity 
for  NGF  receptor  suggests  that  the  mechanism  of  action  of  NGF  differs 
significantly  from  other  peptide  growth  factors  such  as  PDGF,  EGF, colony 
stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), and insulin which are distinguished by the inherent 
tyrosine kinase activities of their receptors. Hence, the role of the 155 amino acid 
cytoplasmic domain in NGF receptor function is not yet known, but this domain 
does  not  contain  any  enzymatic  activities  such  as  serine  or  tyrosine  kinase 
activities. 

4  Receptor  Gene Structure 

Somatic cell hybridization established that the human NGF receptor gene resides 
on  the  long  arm  of chromosome  17  (HUEBNER  et al.  1986).  The  monoclonal 
antibody  against  the  human  receptor was  used  independently  to  assign  the 
receptor gene to chromosome 17 (RETTIG et al.  1986). Using genomic probes for 
the receptor gene,  BREAKEFIELD  et al.  (1986)  have  demonstrated  an absence  of 
linkage  to  familial  dysautonomia,  a  disease  with  defects  that  suggest  NGF 
deprivation. Similarly, the NGF receptor gene locus was also used to establish 
that the  genetic locus  accounting for  von  Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis 
was  near  the  centromeric  region  of chromosome  17  (SEIZINGER  et al.  1987). 
Furthermore, it was shown that the NGF receptor was not the causal gene defect. 
The genomic organization of the receptor gene was established by analysing 
overlapping  bacteriophage  clones  containing  the  receptor  sequence  (SEHGAL 
et al.  1988b).  The  structural  features  of the  NGF  receptor  were  found  to  be 
reflected in the organization of the gene (Fig. 4).  Analysis of the splice junction 
sites  for  the  six  exons  of the  receptor  gene  revealed  that  structurally  distinct 
domains of the receptor are in separate exons (SEHGAL et al. 1988b). For example, 
the second and third exons encode the NHrterminal amino acid sequence of the 
mature receptor protein and a discrete domain of 161  amino acids, of which 24 
are cysteine residues (Table 1). It is of interest that the splice site for the third exon 
is located precisely after the 24th cysteine residue. Similarly, the transmembrane

Fig. 4.  Genomic structure of the human NGF receptor gene. The NGF receptor gene is shown in a 5' 
to 3' orientation with exons represented as boxes. The intron-exon organization of the NGF receptor 
gene was  defined  by  DNA sequence analysis (SEHGAL  et al.  1988b) 

region found  in  the fourth exon contains an intron-exon boundary in the  stop 
transfer  sequence  directly  following  the  hydrophobic  containing  amino  acids. 
Such  precise  divisions  of the  structural  features  of the  receptor  molecule  are 
supportive of a  functional  role  of these  domains. 

The  initiation  site  for  NGF  receptor  gene  transcription  in  human  A875 
melanoma cells and in rat PC12 cells was localized to 122 nucleotides upstream of 
the  initiating  methonine  residue.  Both  primer  extension  and  Sl  nuclease 
protection  experiments  were  used  to  verify  the  initiation  site  (SEHGAL  et al. 
1988b). The upstream promoter sequence was found to be capable of high levels 
of  expression  when  placed  upstream  of  an  unrelated  reporter  gene,  such  as 
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. 

The sequence of the receptor promoter reveals a high G + C content but lacks 
consensus TAT A and CAA T sequences. Several conserved GGGCGG sequences 
are present within 20 nucleotides of the initiator A TG codon (Fig.  5). These GC 
rich sequences represent potential binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 
(DYNAN and THAN 1983). Several eukaryotic genes have promoters which are rich 
in GC content but lack the characteristic TAT A and CAA T boxes. Most of these 
genes encode enzymes with housekeeping functions and expression of these genes 
is  at a  low  constitutive level  in diverse  tissues.  Significantly,  the  promoters  of 
several  cellular growth control genes  such  as  c-Harvey ras  (ISHII  et al.  1985a), 
c-Kirsten ras (HOFFMAN et al. 1987), the EGF receptor (ISHII et al. 1985b), and the 
insulin  receptor  (ARAKI  et al.  1987)  also  lack  the  typical  TAT A  and  CAA T 
transcriptional consensus sequence, but have multiple GC box motifs. Since these 
gene products are in some way involved with growth control and their promoter 
elements are similar, regulation of these genes may share common mechanisms.

Fig. 5.  The NGF receptor promoter sequence. The initiation site for NGF receptor transcription was 
mapped  by  primer extension  and  Sl  nuclease  protection  analysis  (SEHGAL  et al.  1988b).  Boldface 
nucleotides denote potential  sites  of interaction  with  the  transcription  factor  Sp 1.  The  numbering 
begins from  the site  of initiation ( + 1) 

The promoter for  the NGF receptor therefore resembles  those genes  which 
are  constitutively  expressed  or  involved  in  growth  regulation.  An  unusual 
features ofthis promoter is that it appears to direct transcription primarily from a 
major site of initiation instead of using multiple sites of initiation as occurs with 
many constitutively expressed genes.  The single initiation site  was  observed in 
both  human  melanoma  cells  and  PC12  cells  (SEHGAL  et al.  1988b).  The 
constitutive nature of the receptor promoter implies that the neuronal-specific 
expression and developmental regulation of the receptor gene is dependent upon 
other regulatory elements. Transgenic mice expressing human NGF receptors in 
appropriate cell  types indicate  that neuronal specific  expression  is  dictated  by 
DNA sequences  apart  from  the  promoter (PATIL  et al.  1990).  In addition,  the 
features  of the receptor promoter may explain not only why  this  tissue-specific 
gene is expressed efficiently in mouse fibroblasts after transfection with genomic 
DNA, but may also account for the detection ofNGF receptors in nonneuronal 
cells  (RAIVICH  et al.  1985;  THORPE  et al.  1987). 

5  Expression of N G F  Receptors 

Transcription  of  the  NGF  receptor  gene  is  undoubtedly  necessary  for  the 
continued maintenance and survival of sympathetic and sensory nerve systems as 
well  as  cholinergic neurons in  the basal forebrain  (GNAHN  1986).  As  described 
elsewhere in this volume, NGF receptors have been primarily characterized by 
cross-linking with radioiodinated NGF at the cell surface (MASSAGUE et al.  1981; 
GROB  et al.  1983;  HOSANG  and  SHOOTER  1985;  GREEN  and  GREENE  1986); 
immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibodies (Ross et al.  1984; SPRINGER et al. 
1986; GARIN CHESA et al.  1988); equilibrium binding to whole cells (SUTTER et al. 
1979; SCHECHTER and BOTHWELL  1981); and radioautography of iodinated NGF 
bound  to  tissue  sections  (RICHARDSON  et al.  1986;  BERND  1986;  RAIVICH  and 

The  Membrane  Receptor for  Nerve  Growth  Factor 

47 

KREUTZBERG 1987). The availability of recombinant DNA clones for the chicken, 
rat, and human NGF receptors  provides additional tools for  investigating the 
regulation ofNGF receptor gene expression during development of the nervous 
system. In particular, in situ hybridization (ERNFORS et aL  1988; A YER -LELIEVRE 
et al.  1988a;  GIBBS  et al.  1989),  RNA  blot  analysis,  and SI  nuclease  protection 
(BUCK  and CHAO  1989)  have  been  useful  techniques. 

Classic  target  cell  populations  for  NGF  have  been  examined  for  in vivo 
expression ofNGF receptor mRNA (BUCK et al.  1987; SCHATTEMAN  et al.  1988; 
ERNFORS et al.  1988). In rat sympathetic ganglia, which utilize NGF throughout 
the lifespan  of the animal steady state levels  of NGF receptor mRNA increase 
with development. In contrast, dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons that require 
NGF for survival only during early developmental periods express lower levels of 
receptor mRNA levels after birth (BUCK et al. 1987). Receptor mRNA levels reach 
a peak in early chicken brain development at embryonic days 6-10, but decrease 
significantly  at  later  embryonic  ages  (ESCANDON  and  CHAO  1989).  These 
observations  indicate  that  the  appearance  and  disappearance  of  the  NGF 
receptor in these neuronal tissues may be a significant parameter that determines 
the ability ofNGF to influence selective cell populations. Since NGF appears to 
be  synthesized  at  a  low,  constant  level  in  most  tissues,  regulation  of receptor 
affinity  and gene expression may determine which  cells  respond  to  NGF. 

Perhaps  the  most  interesting  aspect  of  receptor  expression  has  been 
nonneuronal cell  populations, such as  testis  (AYER-LELIEVRE  et al.  1988b), and 
Schwann  cells  after  peripheral  nerve  transection  (T ANIUCHI  et al.  1986b; 
HEUMANN et al.  1987) or cell culture (LEMKE and CHAO  1988). The increased levels 
of mRNA and protein for  both NGF and NGF receptor in  Schwann cells after 
nerve lesioning are not understood, but this event may facilitate  nerve  regener(cid:173)
ation (JOHNSON et al. 1988). The expression ofNGF receptor mRNA in areas such 
as testis, muscle (RAIVICH et al.  1985), and lymphoid tissues such as thymus and 
spleen  (ERNFORS  et al.  1988)  indicates  that  the  actions  of NGF  may  not  be 
restricted only to cells derived from the neural crest. For example, NGF is known 
to  bind  to  T  cells  (THORPE  et al.  1987),  to  influence  the  differentiation  of 
eosinophils and basophils (MATSUDA et al.  1988), and to have proliferative effects 
upon mast cells  (ALOE  and  LEVI-MoNTALCINI  1977). 

6  Transfection of NGF Receptors 

Equilibrium binding of 125I_NGF to responsive cells reveals two distinct affinity 
states for the NGF receptor (SUTTER  et al.  1979;  LANDRETH  and SHOOTER  1980; 
SCHECHTER  and BOTHWELL  1981). In most responsive cells, such as neurons and 
PC12  cells  (GREENE  and  TISCHLER  1976),  approximately  10%-15%  of  the 
receptors display high affinity binding with a Kd of 10- 11  M, with the remainder 
of the receptors possessing a Kd of 10- 9  M. The difference in equilibrium binding 

48 

M.  V.  Chao 

is accounted for by a  100-fold difference in the rate of dissociation of NG F. It is 
generally  believed  that  the  high  affinity  receptor  is  internalized  upon  NGF 
binding and is  responsible for  the actions  of NGF. 

Human and rat NGF receptor cDNAs introduced into mouse fibroblast cell 
lines  only give  rise  to  the low  affinity  kinetic class  of receptors (JOHNSON  et al. 
1986; RADEKE et al.  1987). As many as 500000 receptors per cell can be observed 
after transfection; however, none of the cell lines display any detectable response 
to  NGF treatment (HEMPSTEAD  et al.  1988). 

The introduction of a full length human receptor cDNA into a variant PC12 
cell line (NRI8) resulted in the generation of both high and low affinity receptors 
with affinities similar to those of the kinetic classes found in sympathetic neurons 
and PC12 cells (HEMPSTEAD et al. 1989). The NR18 cell line was chosen due to the 
lack  of  endogenous  NGF  receptors  and  the  inability  to  respond  to  NGF 
(BOTHWELL et al. 1980). The appearance of high affinity human NGF receptors in 
this  cell  line  was correlated with  a  functional  response,  the  induction  of c- fos 
transcription by NGF. These results indicate that the cloned receptor cDNA can 
give rise to functional NGF receptors in appropriate cells. The detection of only 
one mRNA species in cell lines that display only low affinity receptors (melanoma 
and transfected fibroblasts) and cell lines that have predominantly high affinity 
receptors (SY-5Y neuroblastoma) also demonstrates that one gene give rise to a 
single mRNA species,  specifying  both kinetic forms  of the  NGF receptor. 

The lack of appropriate responses to NG F in many cells expressing abundant 
NGF receptors strongly suggests that most cells do not possess either the correct 
cellular  environment  or  the  appropriate  signaling  machinery.  The  lack  of  a 
response can also be correlated with the absence of the high affinity form of the 
receptor, which mediates many of the biological responses ofNGF (GREEN et al. 
1986). Hence, clarification of the biochemical nature of the high affinity form  is 
crucial in understanding the mechanisms by which the receptor protein transmits 
its intracellular signal after binding to NGF. Differential splicing does not appear 
to give  rise  to the two  kinetic forms  of the receptor and, furthermore, no other 
evidence has been found for another gene related to the receptor that binds NGF 
(HEMPSTEAD et al.  1988). Although posttranslational modifications may account 
for a difference of affinity, there is presently no indication that a posttranslational 
even influences ligand  affinity  for  NGF. 

The most plausible explanation for  the difference in  receptor ligand affinity 
for  the  NGF  receptor  is  that  a  distinct  regulatory  protein  interacts  with  the 
receptor and dictates the affinity of the receptor for its ligand. The expression of 
high  affinity receptors only in selected cells from  the neural crest implies that a 
separate  protein  may  be  required  for  the  high  affinity  state.  Several  different 
observations  makes  this  a  tenable  hypothesis.  First,  biochemical  attempts  to 
characterize the NGF receptor using affinity cross-linking agents have described 
cross-linked  species  larger  than  the  100000  molecular  weight  receptor-NGF 
complex. A higher molecular weight species of 135000-158000 can be identified 
by  cross-linking  125I-NGF  with  the  receptor  using  a  lipophilic  reagent 
(MASSAGUE  et al.  1981;  HOSANG  and  SHOOTER  1985;  GREEN  and GREENE  1986). 

The Membrane Receptor for  Nerve Growth Factor 

49 

This  complex  is  though  to  represent  125I_NGF  cross-linked  with  the  NGF 
receptor together with a  separate regulatory  protein. 

Second, examination of the human (JOHNSON  et al.  1986), rat (RADEKE  et al. 
1987), and chicken (LARGE et al.  1989; HEUER  et al.  1990) NGF receptor amino 
acid  sequences  indicates  that  an  extremely  strong  region  of  conservation  is 
present  in  the  transmembrane  region  and  extends  50  amino  acids  into  the 
cytoplasmic domain (Fig.  1). No differences exist in any of the amino acids of the 
chicken,  rat,  and  human  NGF  receptors  in  this  transmembrane  region.  It is 
attractive  to  speculate  that this  particular domain  of the  receptor  is  so  highly 
conserved  because  of  important  interactions  with  other  proteins  closely  as(cid:173)
sociated with the plasma membrane. There are a number of amino acid changes 
throughout  the  molecule,  and  these  differences  do  not  appear  to  inhibit  the 
function  of the  receptor.  For example,  the  binding domain for  NGF must  be 
highly conserved in the receptor structure, since the mouse submaxillary NGF 
that has been used  almost exclusively for equilibrium binding studies gives  the 
same  values  of  Kd  for  receptors  on  human,  rat,  bovine,  or  chicken  cells. 
Additionally,  receptors  from  different  species  for  interleukin-2  (SHIMUZU  et al. 
1985)  and  LDL  (YAMAMOTO  et al.  1986)  contain  differences  in  amino  acid 
sequence in  transmembrane domains,  suggesting  that the  lack  of change in  this 
transmembrane domain for  the  NGF receptor  must  be  highly  significant  and 
essential for  the function  of the  receptor. 

Thus, the two kinetic forms of the NGF receptor appear to be encoded by the 
same  protein (GREEN  and GREENE  1986)  which  is  the  product  of a  single  gene 
(HEMPSTEAD  et al.  1989).  Several  possibilities  remain for  an  associated  protein 
which  is  capable  of  modulating  the  affinity  state  of  the  NGF  receptor. 
Microinjection or introduction of ras  (BAR-SAGI  and FERAMISCO  1985;  HAGAG 
et al.  1986;  NODA  et al.  1985;  GUERRERO  et al.  1986)  or sare  (ALEMA  et al.  1986) 
oncogene  products  leads  to  a  differentiation  of  PC12  cells  or  sympathetic 
neurons  (BOROSCIA  et al.  1989)  much  like  the  effect  of NGF.  It remains  to  be 
established whether NGF-mediated events are directly dependent upon interac(cid:173)
tions  of the  receptor  with  ras  or sare  proteins.  The  structure  of the  receptor 
protein does not contain any sequences which interact with known G  proteins. 
Resolution of the molecular basis of the two kinetic forms  of the NGF receptor 
will  undoubtedly begin to unravel the complex series of events that  result from 
NGF binding to responsive cells. 

7  Conclusions 

The unique set of responses elicited by NGF and its role as a trophic and tropic 
factor implies that the signal transduction mechanism is distinctive. From results 
of transfection  of cDNA  clones  for  the  receptor  and  biochemical  experiments 
using affinity cross-linking with 125I_NGF, the high affinity functional form of the 
NGF receptor  most  likely  represents  a  bimolecular  complex  consisting  of the 

50

80000-85000 molecular weight binding protein in association with an accessory 
protein. The ability to generate a  responsive receptor in certain populations of 
cells  is  reminiscent  of the  behavior  of the  interleukin-2  (IL-2)  receptor,  which 
displays high affinity IL-2 binding in  appropriate T  cell  populations. The IL-2 
receptor  contains  a  second  accessory  molecule  that  binds  IL-2.  Unlike  this 
lymphokine receptor, however, the presumed accessory molecule associated with 
the NGF receptor does  not bind  NGF (HEMPSTEAD  et al.  1989). 

Despite many attempts to identify a second messenger for NGF, the precise 
role and identity of signaling pathways for NGF have not been established. The 
accumulated  data  indicate  that  NGF  binding  to  its  receptor  does  not  utilize 
cAMP  as  a  second  messenger,  and  does  not  elicit  a  change  in  either  Ca + 2 
mobilization  or  turnover  of  phosphoinositides  (CHAO  1990).  On  one  level,  it 
is clear that protein phosphorylation events mediate the many effects that NGF 
has upon responsive cells (see  HALEGOUA  et aI.,  this  volume).  Dissection of the 
steps in the signal transduction pathways of NGF will undoubtedly require the 
molecular and biochemical characterization of the  high  affinity  NGF receptor 
and an understanding of its role in carrying signals from the cell membrane to the 
interior of the cell.

1  Introduction 

The pioneering investigations  of LEVI-MONTALCINI  and coworkers established 
that  nerve  growth  factor  (NGF)  is  an  important  physiological  regulator  of 
neurons  of the  peripheral  nervous  system.  No  doubt  in  part  b,ecause  of the 
dramatic  and  specific  effects  on  the  sympathetic  and  sensory  nervous  system 
resulting from immunochemically depriving rodents ofNGF (LEVI-MoNTALCINI 
and BOOKER 1960; JOHNSON et al.  1983), the notion that the action of NGF was 
directed  exclusively  to  these  peripheral  neurons  became  firmly  entrenched.  A 
functional model which proposed that NGF was produced by targets of sensory 
and  sympathetic innervation,  regulating  the  specificity  of axon growth  to  the 
target  and  the  survival  of neurons  which  found  the  correct  target,  became 
dogmatically  accepted.  Over the  last few  years  it  has  become  clear  that these

concepts  are  only  partially  correct.  Aided  in  substantial  part  by  improved 
methods for characterization of sites of expression ofNGF and its receptor, it has 
been shown that the biology ofNGF action is much more complicated than was 
initially imagined. 

2  Potent Sources of NGF 

Efforts  to characterize the  biologically important sites  of NGF synthesis have 
been complicated by the existence of peculiar species-specific sites of abundant 
NGF synthesis. As discussed by Fahnestock in this volume, NGF is produced in 
substantial  quantities  in  the  salivary  glands  of  mice  and  the  African  rat 
M astomys, in the prostate gland of guinea pigs, and in bovine seminal vesicles, 
while no high potency source ofNGF has been found in humans (HEINRICH and 
MEYER 1988). Whether these sources ofNGF have specific biological roles in the 
species where they occur has not been established. What is clear, however, is that 
the NGF which supports the development of the  peripheral nervous system is 
derived from  other, less  potent sources. This is  implicit in the observation that 
many vertebrate species such as humans do not possess  tissues  where NGF is 
stored in large concentrations and that surgical removal of mouse salivary glands 
does  not effect development of the peripheral nervous system. 

While high potency sources ofNGF have confused efforts to understand the 
physiology ofNGF action, they have benefited efforts to characterize the factor 
biochemically, as described by Fahnestock in this volume. NGF exists in various 
oligomeric forms, the distribution of which in various biological sources has not 
been fully worked out. Nonetheless, the biologically active component consists of 
homodimeric fJ-NGF, hereafter in this chapter referred to simply as NGF. The 
availability  of high  abundance  sources  of NGF  has  also  been  invaluable  in 
permitting the generation of specific antibodies and molecular clones of NGF. 
Application  of these  molecular  probes  has  been  essential  for  characterizing 
biologically relevant sources  of NGF, as  described below. 

3  Techniques for  Identification of Biological Sources  of NGF 

The early literature concerning localization of NGF in various tissues in many 
cases is best ignored. Some ofthe earliest studies employed biological assays with 
misleading results in some instances because the existence of other factors with 
NGF-like biological activity, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and brain(cid:173)
derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), was not recognized. However, in cases where 
it can be demonstrated that biological activity is eliminated by specific antibodies 
to NGF, biological assays can be quite  helpful. 

Tissue  Localization of Nerve Growth Factor and Its  Receptors 

57 

A second source of confusion in the early literature resulted from the use of 
inappropriate  immunoassays.  Tissues  and  blood  serum  contain  one  or more 
NGF binding proteins (SUDA et al. 1978), including a-2 macroglobulin (Koo and 
STACH 1989), which interfere in conventional immunoassays giving false positive 
or  false  negative  results  depending  on  the  assay  used.  Not  until  a  two-site 
immunoassay  for  NGF  was  developed  (SUDA  et al.  1978;  KORSCHING  and 
THOENEN 1983) did it become possible to meaningfully assay NGF levels in tissue. 
Interpretation  of results  of NGF localization  must take  into  account  one 
additional confusing factor. NGF-responsive neurons have the capacity to take 
up NGF at axon endings and transport it retrogradely to the cell body where it 
may accumulate in intact form in substantial quantities (STOEKEL and THOENEN 
1975). Thus in some cases, localization of NGF protein may identify targets of 
NGF action rather than sites ofNGF biosynthesis. In this regard, development of 
hybridization probes for NGF mRNA has been invaluable as this permits one to 
distinguish between sites of synthesis and sites  of accumulation of NGF. 

4  Techniques for  Identification  of Cellular Sites 

of NGF Receptor Expression 

For many years, the only available method for assay of NGF receptor (NGFR) 
was  binding  of  125I_NGF.  Used  on dissociated  cells  or cell  membranes,  this 
approach has led to the characterization of high and low affinity  subclasses of 
NGFR which appear to be two functionally different forms of the same receptor 
protein, as described by CHAO in this volume. Such in vitro binding assays, while 
quantitative, are poorly suited for identification ofthe specific cell types within a 
tissue which express NGFR. Other techniques which similarly combine excellent 
quantitation  but  poor  cellular  resolution  include  northern  blot  or  nuclease 
protection  assays  for  NGFR  mRNA  and  electrophoretic  analysis  of NGFR 
labeled  by  affinity  cross-linking  of  125I_NGF,  with  or  without  subsequent 
immunoprecipitation. Where identification of NGFR positive cell types is more 
important than precise quantitation, in situ techniques such as autoradiographic 
localization  of  125I-NGF  to  tissue  sections,  in  situ  hybridization  to  NGFR 
mRNA, and immunohistochemical localization of receptors with  specific  anti(cid:173)
bodies  are  more  appropriate.  In  this  review  I  will  discuss  primarily  reports 
employing the latter class of techniques. In comparing results obtained with these 
techniques it is important to remember that 125I_NGF binding labels preferenti(cid:173)
ally  receptors  of the  high  affinity  class.  In contrast, as  high  and low  affinities 
derive from the same NGFR mRNA, in situ hybridization does not discriminate 
between  high  and  low  affinity  receptor  expression.  It  is  not  clear  whether 
immunohistochemical localization of receptors preferentially labels one affinity 
class of receptors. It has been suggested that the commonly used antibody to rate 
NGFR 192 IgG (CHANDLER et al.  1984), recognizes only the low affinity class of 

58 

M.  Bothwell 

receptors  (YAN  et al.  1988).  However,  some  results  suggest  that  the  antibody 
recognizes both receptor classes (GREEN  and GREENE  1986).  Antibodies against 
human NGFR (Ross et al.  1984; MARANO et al.  1987) appear to recognize both 
high  and low  affinity  receptors  as  these  antibodies  block  biological  actions  of 
NGF thought to be mediated by the high affinity form  of receptor (HEMPSTEAD 
et al.  1989). 

5  N G FR in  the  Peripheral  Nervous System 

The  results  of immunodeprivation  of NGF  in  neonatal  or  prenatal  animals, 
coupled with studies ofresponses in tissue culture, indicate that NGF supports 
the  survival  and  differentiation  of  sympathetic  neurons  and  the  nociceptive 
subclass  of  neural  crest-derived  primary  sensory  neurons.  By  contrast, 
parasympathetic  neurons,  placodally  derived  sensory  neurons,  and  pro(cid:173)
prioceptive,  neural  crest-derived,  sensory  neurons  apparently  do  not  require 
NGF for survival (PEARSON  et al.  1983). The pattern of expression of NGFR in 
the peripheral nervous system is not wholly concordant with the subpopulations 
of neurons known to be dependent on NGF. NGFR expression on neurons ofthe 
peripheral  nervous  system  has  been  assessed  in  vivo  at  the  cellular  level  by 
binding  of 1251_NGF  to  tissue  sections  of chick  and  rat  (RAIVICH  et al.  1985; 
RAIVICH et al.  1987; RAIVICH and KREUTZBERG  1987; RICHARDSON et al. 1986), by 
immunohistochemical techniques in rat and primates (YAN  and JOHNSON  1988; 
MARANO  et al.  1987;  SCHATTEMAN  et al.  1986;  KOH  et al.  1989)  and  by  in  situ 
hybridization to chick and rat tissue sections (ERNFORS et al.  1989; GOEDERTet  al. 
1989;  PERUSIO  and BROOKS  1988; HEUER  et al.  1990;  KOH  et al.  1989).  By  all  of 
these  techniques,  NGFR  expression  is  observed  in  placode-derived  sensory 
neurons as well  as in neural crest-derived  sensory neurons (RAIVICH  et al.  1987; 
YAN  and JOHNSON  1988; HEUER  et al.  1990). While  1251_NGF binding studies in 
chicken  suggested  that  epibranchial  placode-derived,  cranial  sensory  neurons 
express NGFR only transiently and only at low levels (RAIVICH et al. 1987), in situ 
hybridization  revealed  that  epibranchial  placode-derived  neurons  express 
NGFR mRNA in the same quantities and in the same temporal pattern as neural 
crest-derived neurons (HEUER et al.  1990). In agreement with the latter finding, in 
rat, NGFR immunoreactivity is expressed in placode-derived sensory neurons at 
similar levels and in a similar development temporal pattern as for neural crest(cid:173)
derived  sensory neurons (YAN  and JOHNSON  1988).  Although  one  recent  study 
suggested that NGF binding activity is  not expressed in sensory neurons  until 
after  sensory  axons  have  reached  their  targets  (DAVIES  et al.  1987),  in  situ 
hybridization revealed that NGFR mRNA is expressed, albeit at low levels, from 
the earliest stages of ganglionic development (HEUER et al.  1990) and that NGFR 
immunoreactivity is  present in  rat and chick  neurons from  the earliest  time  of 
formation  of dorsal  root  ganglia  (Y AN  and JOHNSON  1988;  HEUER  et al.  1990). 

Tissue  Localization  of Nerve  Growth  Factor and  Its Receptors 

59 

Indeed, premigratory cells of the neural crest and epibranchial placode express 
NGFR mRNA (HEUER et a!.  1990). In apparent contradiction to this fmding, the 
high affinity form of NGFR has not been detected on premigratory neural crest 
cells in culture (BERND  1985). Possible explanations for these differing results are 
that expression ofNGFR mRNA may precede expression of cell surface receptors 
by a significant length of time; that in situ hybridization may be a more sensitive 
method of detecting low  levels  of NGFR expression;  or that neural  crest cells 
express only the low affinity form of receptor. Early in development, NGFR are 
expressed  at  uniform  levels  in  the  majority  of neural  crest  and epibranchial(cid:173)
derived sensory neurons,  but as  neurons  become fully  differentiated  there is  a 
heterogeneous distribution of receptor expression. Most or all sensory neurons 
express NGFR at a detectable level, but a subpopulation of cells are much more 
strongly  positive  than  the  remainder  (RICHARDSON  et a!.  1986;  RAIVICH  et a!. 
1985;  ERNFORS  et a!.  1989; VERGE  et a!.  1989;  HEUER  et a!.  1990).  It is  probable 
that the strongly positive subpopulation corresponds to the nociceptive neurons. 
This  notion is  supported by  the observation that NGFR immunoreactivity is 
detected  in  spinal  cord  axonal  projections in  the  substantia gelatinosa  where 
nociceptive projections predominate but not in  dorsal  horn laminae  receiving 
proprioceptive  projections  (SCHATTEMAN  et a!.,  manuscript  in  preparation). 
Thus,  NGFR  expression  is  highest  in  the  neuronal  subpopulation  which  is 
dependent on NGF for survival. 

While  NGF-dependent  neuronal  survival  is  characteristic  of sympathetic 
neurons but not parasympathetic neurons, NGFR is expressed in both. YAN and 
JOHNSON (1988) reported that rat sympathetic neurons show only modest levels of 
NGFR  immunoreactivity,  irrespective  of  the  stage  of  development,  while 
parasympathetic and enteric neurons are only transiently positive.  BUCK  et a!. 
(1987)  reported  that  NGFR  mRNA  levels  in  rat  sympathetic  ganglia  rise 
several  fold  postnatally.  In  rats,  by  in  situ  hybridization  as  well  as  by 
immunohistochemical techniques, investigators in my laboratory have observed 
substantial and comparable levels ofNGFR expression in both sympathetic and 
some  parasympathetic  neurons  throughout  development  and  into  adulthood 
(SCHATTEMAN  et a!.  1986;  SCHATTEMAN  et aI.,  unpublished).  We  also  have 
observed substantial expression  of NGFR mRNA  in enteric neurons in chick 
embryos (HEUER et al.  1990) and in both fetal and adult human enteric neurons 
(SCHATTEMAN, unpublished). In adult human tissue, only a subfraction of enteric 
neurons are NGFR positive. The possible significance of expression ofNGFR in 
cell  types not apparently responsive  to NGF is  discussed  below. 

In  addition  to  neurons  of the  peripheral  nervous  system,  glial  cells  also 
express  NGFR.  Both  Schwann  cells  and  perineurial  fibroblasts  of peripheral 
nerves express NGFR (ZIMMERMAN  and SUTTER  1983; Ross et a!.  1984).  During 
embryogenesis,  NGFR is  expressed  on Schwann cells  of all  peripheral nerves, 
while in adulthood NGFR is expressed on all Schwann cells of sympathetic and 
parasympathetic  nerves  and  on  nonmyelinating  Schwann  cells  of small  peri(cid:173)
pheral sensory nerves,  but not on Schwann cells  of pure motor nerves  or large 
mixed  nerves  such  as  the  sciatic nerve (YAN  and  JOHNSON  1988;  SCHATTEMAN 

60 

M.  Bothwell 

et aI.  1988;  CHESA  et aI.  1988;  SCARPINI  et aI.  1988;  THOMPSON  et aI.  1989; 
SCHATTEMAN,  unpublished  work).  Various  cell  .types  related  in  lineage  to 
Schwann  cells  or  perineurial  fibroblasts  also  express  NGFR.  These  include 
capsular  cells  of  Meissner,  Pacianian,  and  Ruffini  sensory  corpuscles 
(SCHATTEMAN  et aI.,  manuscript  in  preparation),  ganglionic  satellite  cells 
(ZIMMERMAN and SUTTER 1983; MARANO et aI. 1987), and satellite cells of adrenal 
medulla  and  carotid  body  (THOMPSON  et aI.  1989).  Nerve  sheath  tumors 
universally express NGFR (THOMPSON et al. 1989). JOHNSON and coworkers have 
argued that Schwann cells are not capable of responding to NGF and suggest 
that Schwann cell NGFR may function to bind NGF and "present" it to axons of 
responsive neurons (T ANIUCHI et aI. 1986). However, SEILHEIMER and SCHACHNER 
(1986)  have  reported  that  Schwann  cells  are  biologically  responsive  to  NGF, 
inducing expression of the adhesive  protein L1.  In addition, as  Schwann cells 
themselves produce NGF (see below) it must be considered that they may be self(cid:173)
stimulated in an autocrine fashion,  minimizing effects  of added NGF. 

6  Sources of NGF for  the  Peripheral Nervous System 

For many years a central hypothesis of workers in the NGF field has been that 
sensory and sympathetic neurons derive NGF trophic support from  th~ targets 
which they innervate. Consistent with this hypothesis, there is good correlation 
between density of sympathetic innervation of various tissues and levels ofNGF 
and NGF mRNA in those tissues (KORSCHING and THOENEN 1983; SHELTON and 
REICHARDT  1984;  HEUMANN  et aI.  1984;  KORSCHING  and THOENEN  1988).  In a 
target of dense sensory innervation, the maxillary process of mice, NGF mRNA is 
expressed in the epithelium  and,  to a  lesser extent,  the adjacent mesenchyme. 
(DAVIES  et aI.  1987).  Remarkably, NGF does  not appear in  this  target during 
embryogenesis until after sensory axons first arrive, implying that target-derived 
NGF cannot play any role in directing axons to their targets but many function 
solely  in  providing  trophic  support  to  neurons  after  innervation  has  been 
accomplished.  It must  be  noted  that  the  axons  of primary  sensory  neurons 
bifurcate, sending branches into the spinal cord or brain stem as well as branches 
to  the  peripheral  target.  As  noted  by  RAIVICH  et aI.  (1985),  the  presence  of 
abundant NGFR on the central projections of sensory neurons suggests that the 
CNS might also provide NGF trophic support. Central rhizotomy of dorsal root 
ganglia demonstrates that sensory neurons do receive trophic support from their 
central projections (YIP and JOHNSON  1984). The levels of NGF mRNA in spinal 
cord are low  but not zero, and substantially higher levels  of NGF mRNA are 
present in brain stem in regions receiving central projections from cranial sensory 
ganglia (SHELTON  and REICHARDT  1986;  LARGE  et aI.  1986).  It is  interesting to 
speculate  that  the  apparent  resistance  of some  cranial  sensory  ganglia  to  the 
effects of immune NGF deprivation might result in part from  their access to an 

Tissue  Localization of Nerve  Growth  Factor and Its Receptors 

61 

NGF  supply  in  brainstem  which  would  not  be  accessible  to  circulating 
antibodies. 

The production ofNGF appears to be a rather common property of epithelial 
cells.  Analogous  to  the  relationship  of  sensory  nerve  fibres  to  cutaneous 
epithelium, the acoustic neuroepithelial hair cells of the cochlear organ of Corti 
are innervated by axons of the sensory neurons of the cochlear ganglion. Thus, 
perhaps it is not surprising that these neuroepithelial cells contain NGF (DEPRES 
et al. 1988). However, it is more difficult to envision a neural function ofthe NGF 
produced by epithelial cells of testes and epididymis. Thus it has been suggested 
that NGF acts  on spermatozoa (AYER-LELIEVRE  et al.  1988a).  Another site  of 
NGF  production  of  uncertain  functional  significance  is  the  pituitary  gland 
(LAHTINEN  et al.  1989;  SOINILA  et al.  1988). 

In mouse salivary gland and heart ventricle, sites of sympathetic innervation, 
NGF  immunoreactivity  appears  embryologically  at  the  time  of ingrowth  of 
sympathetic axons and not before. Thus, for sympathetic neurons as for sensory 
neurons, it appears that NGF functions as a trophic agent but is not involved in 
chemotropic  direction  ofaxons  to  targets  (KORSCHING  and  THOENEN  1988; 
CLEGG  et al.  1989). 

In addition to targets of innervation, another important source of NGF for 
the  peripheral  nervous  system  is  the  nerve  itself.  Schwann  cells  of peripheral 
nerves  contain  NGF  immunoreactivity  (RUSH  1984).  Following  axotomy  of 
peripheral nerves, nonneuronal cells associated with the nerve (Schwann cells and 
perhaps  also  perineurial  fibroblasts)  are  induced  to  produce  NGF  by 
macrophage-derived interleukin-l (IL-l) (HEUMANN et al.  1987; LINDHOLM et al. 
1987,  1988).  This  almost  certainly  has  a  significant  role  in  promoting  nerve 
regeneration. RUSH (1984) suggested that Schwann cells may be a major source of 
NGF for  growning  axons  during  embryonic  development  but  THOENEN  and 
coworkers (DAVIES et al.  1987) concluded that embryonic production ofNGF in 
Schwann  cells  is  small  compared  to  NGF  production  by  the  target.  The 
mechanism  of induction  of  NGF  expression  in  injured  nerves  is  discussed 
below. 

7  NGFR in the Central Nervous System 

Apart from  the NGFR on central projections of sensory neurons, in  the adult 
central nervous  system  NGFR is  expressed  in  high  levels  only  in  neurons  of 
the  cholinergic  magnocellular  complex  of basal  forebrain  (HEFTI  et al.  1986; 
SPRINGER et al.  1987; SCHATTEMAN et al.  1988; KORDOWER et al.  1988; YAN  and 
JOHNSON  et al.  1988;  DAWBARN  et al.  1988a, b;  DREYFUS  et al.  1989;  HEFTI  and 
MASH  1989; BATCHELOR et al.  1989; MUFSON et al.  1988). However, lower levels 
of NGFR  in  adult  rat  brain  have  been  described  in  Purkinje  cells  of  cere(cid:173)
bellum (PIORO  and CUELLO  1988)  and in  neurons  of caudate-putamen,  ventral 

62 

M.  Bothwell 

premammillary  nucleus,  mesencephalic  trigeminal  nucleus,  prepositus  hypo(cid:173)
glossal  nucleus,  raphe nucleus,  and nucleus  ambiguus (KOH  et aL  1989).  In  my 
laboratory we have observed NGFR immunoreactivity in adult primate brains in 
the  basal  forebrain  cholinergic  magnocellular  complex,  neurons  of caudate(cid:173)
putamen,  mesencephalic 
trigeminal  nucleus,  and  nucleus  ambiguous 
(SCHATTEMAN et aL  1988; SCHATTEMAN et aI., unpublished work). The biological 
role ofNGF in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons is described in detail by GAGE 
et aL in this volume. In contrast to the limited expression ofNGFR in adult CNS 
neurons,  during  fetal  and  early  postnatal  development  NGFR  is  transiently 
expressed in a remarkable variety of neuronal populations. In chicken, according 
to  restults  of  NGF  blinding  and  mRNA  in  situ  hybridization  and  solution 
hybridization,  NGFR  is  expressed  at  substantial  levels  in  every  brain  region 
embryologically (HEUER et aL  1990; BUCK et aL  1987; RAIVICH et al.  1987; LARGE 
et aL  1989). The periventricular germinal neuroepithelium is generally devoid of 
NGFR expression, while a uniform low level of expression is present throughout 
the marginal zone.  Much higher levels  of expression appear in specific nuclear 
groups as they differentiate (RAIVICH et aL  1987; ERNFORS et aL  1989; HEUER et aL 
1990).  Neuronal  cell  types  which  express  NGFR  during  late  embryogenesis 
include spinal cord lateral motor column and various brain stem motor nuclei, 
mesencephalic trigeminal sensory nucleus, isthmal nuclei, epithalamus, cerebellar 
Purkinje cells and cells of the external granular layer, and deep cerebellar nuclei 
(ERNFORS et aL  1989; HEUER et aL  1990; VON  BARTHELD,  HEUER and BOTHWELL, 
unpublished work). In rats at comparable stages of development, the generalized 
expression of NGFR mRNA in the marginal zone  is  not observed but NGFR 
hybridization  appears  in  specific  groups  of  differentiated  neurons  generally 
corresponding in identity and level of expression to that observed in chicken (E. 
WHEELER,  unpublished results).  NGFR immunoreactivity in developing rat has 
been  localized  to  lateral  geniculate  nucleus,  medial  terminal  nucleus  of  the 
accessory optic tract, cortical sub plate cells, olivary pretectal nucleus, ventral and 
dorsal cochlear nucleus, superior olive, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, cuneate 
nucleus,  gracile  nucleus,  ventroposterior  thalamic  nucleus,  amygdala,  medial 
nucleus of inferior olive, and cerebellar Purkinje cells, deep nuclei, and external 
granule layer (YAN  and JOHNSON  1988;  ECKENSTEIN  1988;  ALLENDOERFER  et aL 
1990).  Retina  also  expresses  NGFR  on  several  cell  types.  Early  in  retinal 
development,  both  retinal  ganglion  cells  and  cells  of the  inner  nuclear  layer 
express NGFR in rat an in chick (HEUER et al.  1990; ECKENSTEIN  1988).  NGFR 
positive  cells  of the  inner  nuclear layer  include  amacrine  cells  (S.  PATTERSON, 
unpublished work; C. VON BARTHELD, manuscript in preparation). Expression in 
most  of these  sites  decreases  substantially  in  late  prenatal  or  early  postnatal 
development.  In  human and macaque embryos,  transient expression  has  been 
observed  on  inferior  olive  and  climbing  fiber  projections  to  cerebellum,  on 
cerebellar Purkinje cells, and external granule layer, and on deep cerebellar nuclei 
(SCHATTEMAN  et aL  1988;  E.  SCHATTEMAN,  unpublished work). 

NGFR immunoreactivity is also present, in rat and primates, on specific CNS 
glial  populations,  including  glia  of olfactory  glomeruli  (VICKLAND  et aL  1989), 

Tissue  Localization of Nerve Growth  Factor and  Its  Receptors 

63 

Muller  glia  of  adult  retina,  astrocytes  of embryonic  retina  and  optic  nerve 
(SCHATTEMAN et al. 1988; E. SCHATTEMAN and S. PATTERSON, unpublished work), 
and ventricular subependymal cells  and tanycytes (KOH  et al.  1989). 

Of these  novel  sites  of NGFR expression,  perhaps  the  most  remarkable  is 
that  of  motor  neurons.  As  shown  by  1251_NGF  autoradiography,  receptor 
immunohistochemistry,  and  receptor  mRNA  in  situ  hybridization,  motor 
neurons in spinal cord lateral motor column and various brain stem motor nuclei 
transiently express high levels ofNGFR. In spinal cord motor neurons, the timing 
ofNGFR expression correlates approximately with the time of normal develop(cid:173)
mental cell death. By adulthood, NGFR levels are near the limit of sensitivity of 
immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization detection. 

It must be noted that for most of these neuronal populations, there is, as yet, 
no direct evidence for biological regulation by NGF. Three exceptions are basal 
forebrain cholinergic neurons, for which NGF promotes survival and cholinergic 
phenotype  (see  this  volume);  embryonic  trigeminal  motor  neurons,  for  which 
NGF  stimulates  neurite  outgrowth  in vitro  (HEATON  1987);  and  axotomized 
retinal ganglion  cells,  for  which  NGF promotes survival in  rats (CARMIGNOTO 
et al.  1989) and regeneration ofaxons in amphibians (TURNER and GLAZE  1977). 
As  to why NGFR is expressed on cells  which apparently do not respond to 
NGF, several possible explanations exist. The first is that expression ofNGFR on 
these cells is functionally irrelevant; I believe this is unlikely. A second possibility 
is that NGFdoes not modulate readily apparent cellular properties such as cell 
morphology  or  cell  survival  and  growth  but  rather  specific  biochemical 
properties  of  cells  (for  example,  synthesis  of  particular  neurotransmitters  or 
neuropeptides).  Such  regulation  can  only  be  detected  by  appropriate  specific 
assays. A third possibility, especially in culture, is that enough NGF is produced 
by cells in the culture to mask the effects of added NGF. A fourth  possibility is 
that NGF acts in concert with another factor so that NGF alone is necessary but 
no sufficient to give a response. Thus, identification ofthe regulatory role ofNGF 
for  such  cells  will  challenge  the  resourcefulness  and  imagination  of  the 
investigator. 

8  Sources of NGF for  Central  Neurons 

Most  extensively  studied  has  been  the  source  of  NGF  for  basal  forebrain 
magnocellular neurons. The cholinergic neurons of medial septal nucleus project 
to hippocampus, which has the highest level of NGF mRNA of any adult brain 
region (SHELTON and REICHARDT 1986; KORSCHING et al. 1985; WHITTEMORE et al. 
1988). Numerous reports support the belief that NGF is produced in hippocam(cid:173)
pus, taken up by cholinergic axons, and transported retrogradely back to septal 
cell bodies. The results of in situ hybridization suggest that the site of NGF bio(cid:173)
synthesis in hippocampus is  neuronal; NGF mRNA is  detected in hippocampal 

64 

M.  Bothwell 

pyramidal  and  granule  cells  (WHITTEMORE  et al.  1986;  GALL  and  ISACKSON 
1989) and these cells immunostain for NGF (AYER-LELIEVER 1988b). The chapter 
by GAGE  et al.  in this volume,  provides additional discussion of this  topic. 

Embryologically, NGF mRNA appears transiently in cerebellum with a time 
course which correlates excellently with that ofNGFR expression on neurons in 
this region. NGF mRNA also is  expressed transiently in high levels in rat fetal 
olfactory bulb (Lu et al.  1989). While abundant expression of NGFR mRNA in 
olfactory bulb during this period was demonstrated, our results suggest that this 
mRNA derives predominantly from meninges rather than from neurons (HEUER 
et al.  1990;  E.  WHEELER,  unpublished  work).  NGFR  expression  on  neurons 
intrinsic to olfactory bulb and on sensory neuroepithelial cells  of the  olfactory 
mucosa  does  not  appear  until  postnatal  periods  (S.  PATTERSON,  unpublished 
work).  In  chicken,  NGF mRNA is  present in high levels  in the eye  during the 
period  of NGFR expression  on  retinal  neurons  (EBENDAL  et al.  1986).  In  rat, 
NGF immunoreactivity is present in retinal ganglion cells (AYER-LELIEVRE et al. 
1983).  As  discussed  above,  it  is  not  clear  whether  these  cells  make  NGF  or 
accumulate it by axonal uptake and retrograde transport. If these cells produce 
NGF, then, as ganglion cells also express NGFR, this suggests the possibility of 
an autocrine role for  NGF in retinal ganglion cells. 

Also,  it  must  be  considered  that  an  important  source  of  NGF  for  CNS 
neurons  may be external to the  CNS proper.  NGF is  present in  CSF of early 
postnatal  rats,  apparently  deriving  at  least  in  part  from  the  choroid  plexus 
(PATTERSON and BOTHWELL  1989). As NGF artificially introduced into CSF has 
been  shown  to  easily  gain  access  to  and  support  basal  forebrain  cholinergic 
neurons  (see  GAGE  et al.,  this  volume),  the  NGF  endogenously  produced  by 
choroid plexus  may be  biologically important. 

Astrocytes  produce NGF in tissue  culture (LINDSAY  1979)  as  do microglia 
(MALLAT et al.  1989) raising the possibility that glia may be an important source 
of NGF in vivo.  As  yet  there is  little direct evidence that this is  the case. 

9  NGF and  NGFR Expression in  Nonneural Tissue 

NGFR is  expressed  in a  wide  variety  of cell  types  seemingly  unrelated  to  the 
nervous system,  suggesting that NGF may have  wide-ranging biological roles 
outside  the  nervous  system.  The  pioneering  study  of  RAIVICH  et al.  (1985) 
demonstrated  expression  of  high  affinity  NGF  binding  sites  on  embryonic 
mesenchyme  and  developing  muscle.  Subsequent  studies  have  confirmed  and 
extended  these  results  by  immunohistochemical  localization  of  NGFR  and 
in situ localization  of NGFR mRNA (YAN  and JOHNSON  1988;  ERNFORS  et al. 
1988;  HEUER  et al.  1990).  In  embryos,  NGFR  is  expressed  in  so mites  and,  as 
somites  become  subcompartmentalized,  in  sclerotome  and  dermatome.  The 
mesenchyme  of the  branchial  arch  and  of early limb  buds  is  strongly  NGFR 

Tissue  Localization  of Nerve Growth  Factor and Its  Receptors

positive. During subsequent development, NGFR disappears from these mesen(cid:173)
chymal cells and then reappears on myoblasts just prior to the time of myoblast 
fusion.  NGFR  also  is  expressed  transiently  on  the  mesenchyme  surrounding 
developing epithelial structures, such as  hair follicles,  salivary glands, and lung 
bronchioles,  on  embryonic  perivascular  cells,  and  on  embryonic  meninges. 
NGFR  is  not  expressed  on  most  epithelial  structures  during  embryogenesis; 
exceptions  where  NGFR  is  expressed  transiently  include  the  chick  and  rat 
auditory  vesicle  epithelium  (BERND  and  REPRESSA  1989;  VON  BARTHELD  et al. 
submitted), dental epithelium (Y AN  and JOHNSON  1988; BYERS  et al. (1990))  and 
the  luminal  epithelium  of fetal  human  and  rat  intestine  (SCHATTEMAN,  un(cid:173)
published work; E. WHEELER,  unpublished). In adult tissue, mesenchymal tissues 
generally are devoid ofNGFR with the exception of perineurial fibroblasts, some 
perivascular  cells,  and  dental  pulp  cells  (Ross  et al.  1984;  CHESA  et al.  1988; 
THOMPSON et al.  1989; BYERS et al.  1990). However, NGFR expression is induced 
in a  manner reminiscent of the embryonic pattern of expression in the stromal 
tissue  of tumors  such  as  carcinomas (CHESA  et al.  1988;  PERUSIO  and  BROOKS 
1988; THOMPSON et al.  1989). A variety of adult basal epithelial cell types express 
NGFR including glandular myoepithelium, hair follicle  outer root sheath cells, 
salivary gland ducts, lung bronchioles, and oral mucosal epithelium (CHESA et al. 
1988; THOMPSON  et al.  1988,  1989;  S.  PATTERSON,  unpublished work).  The only 
one of these nonneural sites  of NGFR expression where NGF action has been 
carefully investigated is  embryonic auditory vesicle epithelium, for which NG F is 
a  mitogen (REPRESSA  and  BERND  1990). 

10  NGF Action  in  Hematopoietic Cells 

NGF  stimulates  mast  cell  proliferation  (ALOE  1988)  and  promotes  mast  cell 
degranulation (TOMIOKA et al. 1988). However, the NGFR on these cells have not 
been fully characterized. NGF has been reported to act as a mitogen for T and B 
lymphocytes, and NGF receptors on these cells have been described (THORPE and 
PEREZ-POLO  1987;  MORGAN  et al.  1989).  MATSUDA  et al.  (1988)  have  reported 
that NGF stimulates granulocyte differentiation in peripheral blood cell culture, 
possibly  by  stimulating  production  of granulocyte  colony  stimulating  factor 
(G-CSF)  by  T  lymphocytes.  However,  we  have  failed  to  detect  NGFR  im(cid:173)
munoreactivity on splenic or lymph  node lymphocytes (THOMPSON  et al.  1989) 
suggesting that, if NGFR is expressed by lymphocytes, receptor levels  must  be 
very low or,  alternatively, present only  on a  small proportion of lymphocytes. 
CHESA  et al.  (1988)  reported  that  NGFR  immunoreactivity  is  present  on 
lymphocytes oflymph node germinal centers. However, our own work indicates 
that this germinal center immunoreactivity derives primarily, if not exclusively, 
from follicular  dendritic cells, rather than lymphocytes (THOMPSON  et al.  1989). 
We  have  failed  to  observe  any  mitogenic  effect  of NGF  on  rat  lymph  node 
lymphocytes (unpublished).

11  Regulated  Expression of NGF and  NGFR in  Neural Tissue 

Expression  of NGFR in neural tissue is  regulated by complex mechanisms.  In 
dorsal  root  ganglion  sensory  neurons  (VERGE  et al.  1989)  and  magnocellular 
cholinergic  neurons  of  basal  forebrain  (see  GAGE  et aI.,  this  volume)  NGF 
appears  to  upregulate  expression  of its  own  receptor.  Axotomy  of these  cells 
causes diminshed expression ofNGFR. This is apparently due to isolation from 
NGF derived from axon terminal fields since exogenously supplied NGF returns 
NGFR levels to normal. However, adult spinal cord motor neurons cells initially 
lacking NGFR express  the  receptor  after  axotomy (ERNFORS  et al.  1989).  The 
mechanism  of this  induction  is  not  clear.  It is  tempting  to  speculate  that  re(cid:173)
expression ofNGFR after injury may be a common feature among the numerous 
neuronal cell types which normally express NG FR late in development but not in 
adulthood. 

NGFR expression on Schwann cells oflarge peripheral nerves (sciatic nerve, 
sural  nerve)  is  induced  after  nerve  injuries  such  as  experimental  axotomy  or 
neurodegenerative  disease  (TANIUcm  et al.  1986;  HEUMANN  et al.  1987;  SOBUE 
et al.  1988). Neither the mechanism of induction nor its functional significance is 
clear.  Schwann cell  NGFR expression is  repressed  by  contact with  axons in  a 
mechanism  which  is  not  cAMP  dependent  (LEMKE  and  CHAO  1988;  but  see 
MOKUNO  et al.  1988). 

It is important to note that the same types of injuries which induce Schwann 
cells  to  express  NGFR  also  induce  expression  of NGF.  NGF  expression  in 
Schwann  cells  after  nerve  injury  occurs  in  two  temporal  phases.  Following  a 
rapid initial increase in NGF synthesis, the mechanism of induction of which is 
unclear, a second larger burst ofNGF synthesis occurs which is apparently due to 
the  effects  of IL-1  released  by  infiltrating  macro phages  (HEUMANN  et al.  1987; 
LINDHOLM et al. 1988). Also, macrophages themsleves may be a source ofNGF as 
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated brain macrophages produce NGF (MALLAT et al. 
1989). 

Numerous recent reports demonstrate that brain injury of diverse types can 
stimulate NGF production. Types of injury which are effective include surgical 
wounds  (WHITTEMORE  et al.  1987;  GASSER  et al.  1986),  hypoxia  (LOREZ  et al. 
1989), and limbic seizure (GALL and ISACKSON 1989). In limbic seizure, the source 
of induced NGF production is  neuronal.  In other types  of injury  the  cell  type 
responsible  has  not  been  identified,  but  it  has  been  suggested  that  the  source 
might be inflammatory cells  such as  reactive astrocytes (GASSER  et al.  1986)  or 
macrophages (MALLAT  et al.  1989). 

Regulation ofNGF production has been extensively studied in tissue culture. 
IL-l induces NGF production by fibroblasts (LINDHOLM et al.  1988), while NGF 
production  is  depressed  by  glucocorticoids  (HOULGATE  et al.  1989).  Pros(cid:173)
taglandins  and  fJ-adrenergic  compounds  induce  NGF  production  in  astro(cid:173)
cytoma  cells  (DAL  Toso  et al.  1988;  FURAKA WA  et al.  1989;  MOCOHETTI  et al. 
1989;  SCHWARTZ  1988).  In  marked  contrast,  norepinephrine  reduces  NGF 
production by  smooth muscle cells  of the  iris  (HELL WEGG  et al.  1988).

12  Conclusions 

The presence of NGF receptors on a wide variety of neuronal and nonneuronal 
cell  types suggests that NGF may have a much wider range of regulatory roles 
than is currently recognized. It is also clear that a wide range of cell types have the 
capacity  to  produce  NGF.  Thus  the  relationship  between  various  sites  of 
production of NGF and various sites of action of NGF is likely to be extremely 
complex.  The  recent  discovery  that  BDNF  is  structurally  similar  to  NGF 
(LEIBROCK  et al.  1989)  raises  the  question  whether  BDNF  might  interact 
functionally with the NGF receptor and whether additional members of the NGF 
ligand family might remain to be discovered. One is left with the impression that 
we  have  hardly  begun  to  grasp  the  significance  of this  system  of  biological 
regulators.

1  Introduction 

A complete understanding of NGF function in the CNS does not exist. Instead, 
there is a collection of observations based on experiments conducted in the PNS 
and CNS, although more definitive results have come from  experiments in the 
PNS.  The  conclusion  that  NGF  is  a  neurotropic  factor  in  the  PNS  biased 
experimental design and interpretation of results when a function for NGF in the 
CNS  was  sought.  An  example  of design  and  interpretation  bias  is  the  very

significant paper by SCHWAB  et al.  (1979),  showing for the first time retrograde 
transportofNGF in cholinergic neurons. These authors entitled the manuscript 
"Nerve growth factor (NGF) in the CNS: absence of specific retrograde transport 
and  tyrosine  hydroxylase  induction  in  locus  coeruleus  and  substantia nigra", 
documenting the expectation of retrograde transport in catecholamine neurons 
of the CNS, as in the  PNS. Subsequent experiments, reviewed  here,  support a 
neurotrophic role for NGF in the CNS, although in the cholinergic rather than 
catecholaminergic system of CNS neurons. 

During  development  more  neurons  are  generated  than  are  needed  in  the 
mature  CNS.  Some  neurons  undergo  cell  death  at times  when  their growing 
axons compete for target territories, reducing the final number of neurons to that 
found in the adult (COWAN et al.  1984). The extent of neuronal cell death during 
development can be affected by experimentally manipulating the target area of 
the developing neurons to add or subtract target tissue (LANDMESSER and PILAR 
1978; HAMBURGER and OPPENHEIMER  1982). These observations have led several 
investigators to propose that developmental cell death and survival are regulated 
by proteins presumably supplied by the target territory, which have been called 
neurotrophic factors  (NTF) (THOENEN  and BARD  1980).  "Trophic" refers  to  the 
ability of one tissue, cell, or protein to support and/or nourish another; thus a 
neurotrophic  factor  is  a  chemical  or molecule  that  is  made  in  any  cell  that 
supports the survival of,  or nourishes, neurons.  Trophic differs  markedly from 
tropic;  the latter refers  to the influence of one cell or tissue on the direction of 
movement or outgrowth of another. Thus a neurotropic factor is a chemical or 
molecule  that can influence  the direction and/or growth of an axon. 

The  neurotrophic  hypothesis  postulates  that:  (1)  adult  CNS  neurons  are 
supported and regulated  by  their respective  NTFs, (2)  proper maintenance  of 
these neurons depends on adequate supply and utilization of the NTFs in situ, 
(3)  an interference  with  NTF support,  or "neurotrophic deficit",  will  result  in 
defective performance or even degeneration and death of the target neurons, and 
(4) such trophic deficits may be the basis of degenerative central nervous system 
diseases (e.g., Parkinson's, motor neuron, or Alzheimer's disease) or normal aging 
(ApPEL  1981). 

The neurotrophic hypothesis is supported in the CNS by: (1) "developmental 
neuronal death",  in  which  the  excessive  number  of neurons  produced  during 
development  is  decreased  to  accommodate  the  limited  target  cell  number 
(COWAN  et al.  1984);  (2)  "retrograde  neuronal  degeneration",  in  which  axot(cid:173)
omized neurons cut off from their innervation target and surrounding glial cells 
undergo degeneration or even death (PEARSON et al.  1983); and (3) "pathological 
neuronal  death",  where  specific  populations  of  neurons  degenerate  and  die 
(ApPEL  1981;  BARTUS  et al.  1982).  Among several explanations currently being 
tested,  one  that  is  commonly  put  forth  for  such  neuronal  death-inducing 
situations  is  that  neurons  normally  depend  for  their  continued  health  upon 
NTFs, supplied by their target and associated glial cells, and that disruption in 
this  trophic supply causes their death. 

Nerve Growth Factor Function in  the Central  Nervous System 

73 

Nerve growth factor (NGF) is currently the best characterized NTF (BARDE 
et al.  1983;  BERG  1984;  THOENEN  and BARDE  1980;  ULLRICH  et al.  1983).  NGF 
supports the  survival in  vitro  and in vivo  of sensory and sympathetic neurons 
from  the  PNS (GUNDERSON  and  BARRETT  1980)  (neurotrophic).  Furthermore 
NGF  can  attract  and  guide  developing  and  regenerating  axons,  whether 
provided to the neuron in a soluble or immobilized form (GUNDERSON  1980), and 
may even guide axons whose neurons do not require NGF for survival (COLLINS 
and DAWSON  1983)  (neurotropic). 

2  NGF Function  on  eNS Neurons In  Vitro 

NG F can support the survival of embryonic and adult cells, induce and influence 
the direction of fiber outgrowth, and induce the synthesis of specific enzymes in 
vitro. The biological actions  of NGF have been well-studied  in neurons of the 
PNS and have recently  been examined in  the CNS. 

Sympathetic and dorsal root ganglion cells have been extensively studied in 
culture. Cell death is found to occur in these systems (COWAN et al.  1984), perhaps 
as  a  result  of competition for  a  limited  supply  of peripherally derived  trophic 
factors.  Sympathetic ganglion neurons derived from embryonic animals require 
NGF  for  their  survival  (BERG  1984;  CHUN  and  PATTERSON  1977a,  and  b; 
GREENE  1977a;  LEVI-MoNTALCINI  and  ANGELETTI  1963).  NGF  is  also  able 
to  promote the  survival  of dorsal  root ganglion cells  (CRAIN  1975;  CRAIN  and 
PETERSON  1974; GREENE  1977b; LEVI-MoNTALCINI and ANGELETTI  1963) and can 
induce  neurite  extension  in  these  cells  (GREENE  1977b;  LEVI-MoNTALCINI  and 
ANGELETTI  1963). Experiments demonstrating that the direction of growth of the 
neurites from NGF-responsive ganglion cells in culture is influenced by a  NGF 
concentration gradient provided evidence for a tropic effect ofNGF (CAMPENOT 
1977; CHARLWOOD  et al.  1972; EBENDAL and JACOBSON  1977; GUNDERSON  1985; 
GUNDERSON  and  BARRETT  1979,  1980;  LETOURNEAU  1978).  CAMPENOT  (1977) 
showed that NGF can influence the direction of neurite outgrowth and support 
the  survival  of  cells  via  uptake  by  a  cell's  peripheral  projections  without 
involvement of the cell soma. Co cultures of sympathetic ganglia and NGF rich 
tissue  results  in  the  innervation  of the  tissue  by  fibers  from  the  ganglion cells 
(BURNSTOCK  1974;  CHAMLEY  et al.  1973;  JOHNSON  et al.  1972).  NGF  can  also 
increase the activity of specific enzymes in neurons. The application of NGF to 
rat superior cervical  ganglion  cells  in vitro  increases  tyrosine hydroxylase  and 
dopamine  beta  hydroxylase  activity  in  these  cells  (MACDONNELL  et al.  1977; 
MAX  et al.  1978;  OTTEN  et al.  1977).  NGF  is  also  able  to  induce  choline 
acetyl transferase  (ChAT)  activity  in  sympathetic  neurons  (see  THOENEN  and 
BARDE  1980 for  a  review). 

There  is  increasing  evidence  for  a  role  for  NGF  in  the  CNS.  Unlike 
catecholaminergic neurons in the PNS, catecholaminergic neurons in the CNS 

74 

F. H.  Gage et al. 

are unresponsive to NGF (DREYFUS et al.  1980; OLSON et al.  1979). In the CNS, 
cholinergic neurons are responsive to NGF. WAINER et al. (1986) and MARTINEZ 
et al.  (1987)  demonstrated that cultures  of central cholinergic neurons  require 
NGF for their survival, and HARTIKKA and HEFTI (1988) found that NGF affects 
the survival  of cultures  of low  plating density  but not of high  plating density. 
Although  cholinergic  cell  cultures  of  high  plating  density  do  not  require 
exogenous  NGF for  their survival, NGF can stimulate fiber  growth  of septal 
cholinergic neurons (HARTIKKA  and HEFTI  1988).  Additionally, the direction of 
axonal  outgrowth  from  cultured  septal  cells  can  be  influenced  by  NGF. 
GAHWILER  et al.  (1987)  showed  that NGF  can  influence  the  growth  of septal 
axons to cocultured hippocampal slices.  NGF also has been shown to increase 
ChAT activity in cultures of neonatal and fetal basal forebrain cells (GNAHN et al. 
1983; HARTIKKAand HEFTI 1988; HATANAKA and TSUKUI 1986; HEFTI et al. 1985; 
HONEGGER et al.  1986; HONEGGER  and LENOIR  1982; MARTINEZ et al.  1987) and 
striatal cells (MARTINEZ et al.  1985). Antibodies to NGF can block the observed 
increase in ChAT activity in basal forebrain cultures (HARTIKKA and HEFTI 1988; 
HEFTI et al. 1985) and reduce the number of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) positive 
cells in low plating density cultures (HARTIKKA  and HEFTI  1988).  Additionally, 
cultures of hippocampal cells, which are the targets of the cholinergic neurons in 
the septum, were shown to contain NGF-like activity that could be blocked by 
antibodies to NGF (CRUTCHER  and COLLINS  1982). 

NGF is also produced by cultures ofSchwann cells in the PNS and astrocytes 
in  the  CNS  (LINDSAY  1979;  NORRGREN  et al.  1980;  RunGE  et al.  1985).  The 
conditioned  media  from  cultures  of  astrocytes  can  support  the  survival  of 
(LINDSAY  1979) and stimulate neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion cells 
(ASSOULINE  et al.  1987).  Additionally,  cultures  of  embryonic  Schwann  cells 
express the receptor for NGF (NGFr) (HOSANG and SHOOTER 1985; ROHRER 1985; 
ROHRER and SOMMER  1983; ZIMMERMANN and SUTTER  1983). Thus, the evidence 
suggests a  role for  glial cells  in the NGF response. 

3  NGF Function on  eNS Neurons In  Vivo 

A number of studies have shown that NGF occurs in and is produced by both the 
developing  and  adult  CNS.  In  support  of  results  obtained  from  in  vitro 
developmental studies, NGF infusion to neonatal rats increased ChAT content in 
the basal forebrain and septum (MOBLEY et al.  1985, 1986; JOHNSON  et al.  1987). 
NGF  also  appears  to  playa  prominent  role  in  the  development  of  the 
septohippocampal cholinergic projection. The septohippocampal projection in 
the rat develops from embryonic day 20 to postnatal day 14 (MILNER et al. 1983), 
providing the source of all extrinsic cholinergic innervation to the hippocampal 
formation. Total NGF content and NGF mRNA in the hippocampal formation 
rise just prior to developmental increases in ChAT activity during development,

however, suggesting a role for NGF in the guidance and support of approaching 
septal  cholinergic  fibers  (LARGE  et al.  1986;  WHITTEMORE  et al.  1986).  NGF 
receptor (NGFr) content (total  protein) (ECKENSTEIN  1988;  YAN  and JOHNSON 
1988), NGFr mRNA (BUCK  et al.  1987), and total NGF content, but not NGF 
mRNA  (WHITTEMORE  et al.  1986),  rise  during  embryonic  and  neonatal  basal 
forebrain  development,  suggesting  that  these  regions  might  be  preparing  to 
contact a  source of,  and retrogradely transport, NGF. 

In  vivo  data  also  support in  vitro  data  regarding  the  role  of NGF in  the 
development of cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nucleus 
basalis).  NGF  administration  to  developing  neurons  in  this  region  results  in 
increases in ChAT activity (MOBLEY et al.  1986; JOHNSTON et al.  1987), although 
of a  lesser degree  than that seen in the septal region. 

In the  adult,  mammalian CNS tissues  have  been  shown  to  contain:  NGF 
mRNA by northern (RNA) blotting and in situ hybridization (AYER-LELIEVRE 
et al.  1983; WHITTEMORE et al.  1986; LARGE et al.  1986; SHELTON and REICHARDT 
1986;  LARKFORS  et al.  1987);  NGF  antigen  by  immunohistochemical  and 
radioimmunoassays  (AYER-LELIEVRE  et al.  1983;  GREENE  and  SHOOTER  1980); 
NGFr by  autoradiography (RICHARDSON  et al.  1986);  and  NGF by  biological 
assays (COLLINS and DAWSON 1983; SCoTTet al. 1981). The highest NGFlevels in 
CNS tissue appear within the target areas of the cholinoceptive basal forebrain 
systems (SHELTON and REICHARDT  1986), including the hippocampus and cortex, 
and NGF administered into rat brain raises ChAT levels in the hippocampus and 
septum (HEFTI et al.  1984; MOBLEY et al.  1985). Radiolabeled NGF injected into 
target regions is taken up and retrogradely transported by cholinergic neurons, 
including the septal/diagonal band neurons for  the hippocampus and nucleus 
basalis neurons for the neocortex (SCHWAB et al. 1979; SEILER and SCHWAB 1984). 
Assays ofNGF activity, mRNA synthesis, or NGFr positivity have also revealed 
NGF influence in adult olfactory bulb (FRIEDMAN  et al.  1988;  GOMEZ-PINILLA 
et al. 1988), posterior lobe of the pituitary gland (YAN et al.  1988), and neonatal 
and perhaps adult cerebellum (ECKENSTEIN  1988;  T ANIUCHI  et al.  1986;  PIORO 
et al.  1988). 

Trophic factors, possibly including NGF also accumulate in fluids surrounding 
rat brain lesions (CRUTCHER 1987; COLLINS and CRUTCHER 1985; GAGE et al. 1984; 
NIETO-SAMPEDRO et al.  1983). Following lesions of the fimbria/fornix in the adult 
rat, total NGF content in the hippocampus rises by approximately 50%, although 
NGF mRNA does not rise (WHITTEMORE et al.  1986; KORSCHING et al.  1986). The 
latter finding  suggests  a  buildup of NGF in the  hippocampus  from  supplies  of 
NGF  that  would  normally  have  been  retrogradely  transported  to  cells  of the 
medial  septum.  In  the  neonate,  however,  fimbria/fornix  transections  are  asso(cid:173)
ciated  with  an  elevation  in  hippocampal  NGF  mRNA  (WHITTEMORE  et al. 
1986).  The  accumulation  of NGF  in  the  hippocampus  after  denervation  may 
also  result in the sprouting of another population of NGF-dependent processes 
into  this region:  axons of sympathetic neurons located in the superior cervical 
ganglion (CRUTCHER  1987).  Cholinergic neurons  of the adult striatum may also 
respond to NGF, primarily under conditions  of trauma or stress (see  below).

4  N G F  Function  on  Damaged Adult  Neurons:  The  Model 

The cholinergic projection from  the adult rat septum and diagonal band to the 
ipsilateral hippocampus has been a  useful  model for examining CNS plasticity 
(Fig.  1). Neurons of the medial septum and the vertical limb of the diagonal band 
project dorsally  to  the  hippocampus mainly  through  the fimbria/fornix  (GAGE 
et al.  1983;  LEWIS  et al.  1967;  ARMSTRONG  et al.  1987).  About  50%  of  the 
septal/diagonal  band  neurons  sending  fibers  through  the  fimbria/fornix  are 
cholinergic  (AMARAL  and  KURZ  1985;  WAINER  et al.  1985)  and  provide  the 
hippocampus  with  about  90%  of  its  total  cholinergic  innervation  (STORM(cid:173)
MATIDSEN  1974). 

Complete transection ofthe fimbria/fornix pathway in adult rats results in the 
retrograde degeneration and death of many of the septal/diagonal band neurons 
that  originally  contributed  axons  through  this  pathway  (ARMSTRONG  et al. 
1987;  CUNNINGHAM  1982;  GRADY  et al.  1984;  HEFTI  1986;  WAINER  et al. 
1985).  Markers  of cell  survival,  including  retrogradely  transported  fluorescent 
dyes  and  Nissl  stains  (GAGE  et al.  1986;  TUSZYNSKI  et al.  1988),  transmitter 
enzyme expression (AChE, ChAT) (GAGE et al. 1986; ARMSTRONG et al. 1987), and 
NGFr expression on cells of the medial septum (SPRINGER et al.  1987; MONTERO 
and HEFTI  1988; TUSZYNSKI et al.  1988), demonstrate a loss of 70%~90% of cells 
in this region. One recent study suggested that some of these cells may persist for 
extended periods in a dysfunctional state following lesions of the fimbria/fornix 
(HAGG  et al.  1988),  although  several  studies  suggest  that  many  of these  cells 
actually die (MONTERO  and HEFTI  1988; TUSZYNSKI  et al.  1988; ARIMATSU  et al. 
1988;  MV Sofroniew,  personal communication). 

One explanation for this axotomy-induced cell dysfunction or death is  that 
the septal neurons become deprived of a critical supply ofNTF possibly provided

by the postsynaptic neurons or glial cells in the target areas of the hippocampus 
(COLLINS  and  CRUTCHER  1985;  GAGE  et al.  1986;  GNAHN  et al.  1983;  NIETO(cid:173)
SAMPEDRO et al. 1983). That this hippocampal NTF might be NGF or NGF-like 
is supported by the previously listed studies from several laboratories reporting 
an NGF presence within the septohippocampal system. 

Another model for the study ofNGF function in the damaged adult brain is 
the  nucleus  basalis  cholinergic  projection.  The  nucleus  basalis  consists  of a 
collection  of  magnocellular  cholinergic  neurons  in  the  basal  forebrain  that 
provide  diffuse,  predominantly  ipsilateral  projections  to  most  of the  cerebral 
cortex (JOHNSTON  et al.  1981,  1987).  Following cortical destructive lesions, the 
cholinergic  cell  bodies  of this  region  undergo  atrophy  as  shown  by  ChAT 
immunoreactivity  (SOFRONIEW  et al.  1983,  1987)  and  decrements  in  ChAT 
activity (STEPHENS et al. 1985). Death ofthe cholinergic cell bodies in this region 
does  not occur, however.  That this system may also  be influenced by NGF is 
suggested  by  the  presence  of high  levels  of NGF in  the  cortex  (COLLINS  and 
DAWSON  1983;  WmTTEMoRE  et al.  1986;  SHELTON  and  REICHARDT  1986; 
LARKFORS  et al.  1987;  SCOTT  et al.  1984),  the  demonstration  of  retrograde 
transport of 1251_NGF from cortex to nucleus basalis (SEILER and SCHWAB 1984), 
and the demonstration ofNGFr on nucleus basalis neurons using immunocyto(cid:173)
chemistry  and  1251  autoradiography  (RICHARDSON  et al.  1986;  RAIVIcH  and 
KREUTZBERG 1987; SPRINGER et al. 1987; TANIUcm and JOHNSON 1985; TANIUcm 
et al.  1986;  BATCHELOR  et al.  1989;  RIOPELLE  et al.  1987). 

5  NGF Function on  Damaged Adult  Neurons: The  Effect 

The above observations raise the question whether exogenous administration of 
NGF  to  neuronal  populations  in  the  adult  showing  NGF  regulation  might 
prevent lesion-induced neuronal degeneration and atrophy. 

Within the septohippocampal circuit, for  example, NGF administration to 
axotomized  septal  neurons  might  prevent  retrograde  cell  degeneration 
and  death.  This  rescue  by  NGF  might  then  allow  the  axotomized  neurons 
to  regenerate  their  cut  axons  or  extend  new  axons  back  to  the  hippo(cid:173)
campal  formation.  Recently,  several  groups  (HEFTI  1986;  KROMER  1987; 
WILLIAMS  et al.  1986;  GAGE  et al.  1988a)  have  independently  reported  that 
intraventricular administration of purified NGF into adult rats from the time of 
fimbria/fornix  transection onward prevents the loss of most of the axotomized 
cholinergic  septal/diagonal  band  neurons.  Complete  unilateral  fimbria/fornix 
lesions usually result in a loss of 65%-90% of cholinergic cell bodies (GAGE et al. 
1984; ARMSTRONG et al. 1987) compared to the contralateral, unlesioned side, but 
NGF infusion can rescue 90%-100% ofthe cell population (HEFTI 1986; KROMER 
1987; WILLIAMS et al. 1986; GAGE et al. 1988a). Although various lesion and NGF 
infusion paradigms have been used in these studies, the results are consistent and 

78 

F.  H.  Gage et aI. 

comparable.  NGF  has  typically  been  infused  continuously  into  the  lateral 
ventricle,  ipsilateral  to  the  fimbria/fornix  lesion,  for  at  least  a  2-week  period 
through an indwelling cannula that is connected to an osmotic minipump placed 
subcutaneously  in  the  animal's  back  (WILLIAMS  et al.  1986).  Another  experi(cid:173)
mental  paradigm  using  twice  weekly  NGF  injection  into  the  ventricle  of  a 
partially lesioned animal will also prevent retrograde neuronal degeneration in 
the  medial  septum  (HEFTI  1986),  and  unilateral  NGF  infusion  after  bilateral 
fimbria/fornix lesions will spare cholinergic neurons on both sides of the medial 
septum (KROMER  et al.  1981). Both the 7S  and purified 2.5S form  of NGF have 
shown efficacy in these studies. A dose-response curve in this model system has 
not been determined,  but efficacious doses employed empirically in  the  above 
studies  have  ranged  from  a  few  ug/ml  to greater than  lOOug/ml  (HEFTI  1986; 
KROMER  1987;  WILLIAMS  et al.  1986;  GAGE  et al.  1988a). 

Recently, transient infusions of NGF have been shown to be insufficient to 
permanently rescue septal cholinergic neurons (MONTERO and HEFTI  1988). Thus 
work is  currently directed toward inducing the regeneration  of lesioned axons 
from  rescued  septal  cells  back  to  their  hippocampal  target  in  an  attempt  to 
restore an endogenous, continuous supply ofNGF. NGF infusions could then be 
discontinued when axons reconnected with their target, thus permanently rescuing 
the projecting septal neurons (see below). The ability of NGF to induce axonal 
regeneration in the adult CNS in vivo has already been evidenced by the presence 
of robust sprouting of cholinergic fibers  into the dorsolateral quadrant of the 
septum 2 weeks following fimbria/fornix lesions (GAGE  et al.  1986,  1988a). 

Intraventricular injections ofNG F after partial bilateral fimbria/fornix lesions 
can ameliorate behavioral deficits. Following bilateral fimbria/fornix lesions, rats 
are impaired in tests oflearning and mamory (OLTON et aI. 1978). Mter chronic NGF 
treatment, lesioned rats are able to learn a radial arm maze as rapidly as control 
nonlesioned rats following an initial, immediate postoperative impairment (WILL 
and HEFTI 1985). In the same study an increase in ChAT activity is observed in the 
septum and occurs at the same time as the behavioral recovery. Also, the behavioral 
changes are not permanent; the behavioral deficits reappear after cessation ofNG F 
treatment. 

NGF  is  also  capable  of ameliorating  some  lesion-induced  effects  in  the 
nucleus  basalis  model.  Lesion-induced,  retrograde  atrophic  changes  in  the 
nucleus basalis can be prevented by infusion ofNGF into the ventricular system, 
resulting in restoration of nucleus basalis ChAT activity and augmentation of 
remaining ChAT activity in areas of cortex spared by the lesion (HAROUTUNIAN 
et al. 1986). Infusion of the monosialoganglioside GM1 will also restore nucleus 
basalis and cortical ChAT levels, but the combined infusion of both substances 
will  augment  the  response further (CUELLO  et al.  1989;  GAROFALO  et al.  1988). 
These authors suggested that GM1  may act as a  modulator of NGF function. 
NGF effects on cells other than cholinergic neurons in the adult CNS have 
received  less  attention.  GABAergic cells  in addition to cholinergic cells  of the 
medial septum degenerate after fimbria/fornix lesions (PETERSON et al.  1987), and 
one  recent  study  reports  a  failure  of NGF to  save  these  GABAergic  neurons 

Nerve  Growth  Factor Function in  the Central Nervous  System 

79 

(MONTERO  and HEFTI  1988).  The identification ofNGF-responsive cell popula(cid:173)
tions  in  the  CNS  depends  in  part  upon  the  visualization  of  NGFr  with 
immunocytochemical methods. However, since immunocytochemistry currently 
employs antibodies that appear to identify only the low affinity NGFr (T ANIUCill 
and JOHNSON  1985), future  studies may  require methods that detect the  active, 
high affinity  receptor as  well  (e.g.,  autoradiography). 

6  NGF Receptor  Expression  is  Regulated  by  NGF 

The ability of neurons to respond to NG F seems to depend on the presence of cell 
surface  receptors,  which  in  the  PNS  mediate  the  binding,  internalization,  and 
transport ofNGF from the terminals to the parent cell bodies (see THOENEN and 
BARDE  1980  for  review).  Such  NGFr have  also  been  demonstrated  on  NGF(cid:173)
responsive cholinergic neurons in the CNS both during development and in the 
adult animal (TANIUCill  et al.  1986;  RICHARDSON  et al.  1986). 

The cholinergic neurons of the striatum appear to represent a special case. In 
contrast to the neurons in the septal diagonal band area and the nucleus basalis, 
these neurons possess very low or undemonstrable levels of NGFr in the adult, 
and  their  responsiveness  to  NGF  has  been  reported  to  decline  dramatically 
during  postnatal  development  (MARTINEZ  et al.  1985;  MOBLEY  et al.  1985; 
JOHNSTON  et al.  1987).  Nevertheless, our previous findings  showed that chronic 
infusion  of  NGF  into  the  lateral  ventricle  of  adult  animals  following 
fimbria/fornix  lesion not only  spared the  medial  septal neurons from  degener(cid:173)
ation,  but  also  resulted  in  hypertrophy  of  the  cholinergic  neurons  of  the 
ipsilateral striatum (GAGE et al.  1988b). Similarly, chronic infusions ofNGF into 
the  lateral  ventricle  of  aged  rats  ameliorated  the  age-related  atrophy  of the 
cholinergic neurons ofthe striatum as well as of the basal forebrain (FISCHER et al. 
1987).  The  in vivo  effects  of  NGF  on  the  striatal  cholinergic  neurons  are  in 
apparent contradiction with the lack of demonstrable NGFr immunoreactivity 
in these neurons normally. However, TANIUCill et al.  (1986,  1988) have recently 
reported that peripheral nerve damage will  induce the expression  of NGFr on 
Schwann  cells  within  the  denervated  distal  portion  of  the  nerve,  raising  the 
possibility that the ability of striatal neurons to respond to NGF depends on the 
upregulation ofNGFr and that this upregulation is induced by the tissue damage. 
In a recent experiment we tested this hypothesis. Chronic NGF infusion into the 
adult neostriatum resulted in re-expression ofNGFr such that many cholinergic 
interneurons became immunoreactive for  NGFr. This effect  was seen also  after 
striatal damage induced  by infusion  of vehicle  alone,  whereas infusion of anti(cid:173)
NGF serum partially inhibited the receptor's re-expression. Infusion ofNGF, but 
not vehicle alone, dramatically increased the size and ChAT immunoreactivity of 
these same cholinergic neurons (BATCHELOR  et al.  1989). 

These findings indicate that the central cholinergic neurons which lose their 
NGFr  during  postnatal  development  will  resume  their  NGF  responsiveness

when  the  tissue  is  damaged.  Such  a  damage-induced  mechanism  may  act  to 
enhance both the action of trophic factors, including NGF, released at the site of 
injury  and  the  responsiveness  of  damaged  eNS  neurons  to  exogenously 
administered  trophic factors. 

Although damage produces an emergence of NGFr protein immunoreactiv(cid:173)
ity in  adult striatal cholinergic neurons, in situ  hybridization of NGFr mRNA 

Nerve Growth Factor Function  in  the Central  Nervous System 

81 

shows that vehicle infusion by itself will not increase the number ofNGFr mRNA 
positive  neurons  in  the  striatum  as  compared  to  treated  animals  (GAGE  et al. 
1989a).  Thus,  only  NGF  treatment,  but  not  vehicle,  induces  NGFr  gene 
expression within striatal neurons, suggesting the possibility that lesion-induced 
damage increases NGFr levels through non-transcriptional mechanisms, such as 
the "unmasking" of existing stores ofNGFr protein. Additionally, these findings 
are in agreement with our recent in situ hybridization studies which showed that 
chronic  NGF  administration,  but  not  vehicle  infusions,  induce  NGFr  gene 
expression within  those basal forebrain  cholinergic neuronal  populations  that 
normally express NGFr protein in adult rat brain (HIGGINS et al. 1989). NGF not 
only  produced  neuronal  hypertrophy,  as  we  demonstrated  in  earlier  studies 
(FISCHER  et al.  1987), but also increased NGFr mRNA abundance per cell  and 
induced the expression ofNGFr message within basal forebrain neurons that had 
previously  not  contained  detectable  levels  of  NGFr  mRNA  (Fig.  2).  These 
findings  provide  strong  evidence  that NGF  can  induce  expression  of its  own 
receptor within  the  CNS. 

In vitro  evidence  also  supports  the  concept  that  NGF  can  induce  the 
expression  of  its  own  receptor.  When  NGF  is  applied  to  cultures  of septal 
neurons,  striatal  neurons,  or PC12 cells  (BERND  and  GREENE  1984;  HEFTI  and 
GAHWILER  1988),  the  number of NGFr on  the  cells  increases.  In addition,  the 
exposure  of cultured  chick  sensory  neurons  to long-term  NGF treatment  will 
prevent the normal disappearance of receptors on these cells (ROHRER and BARDE 
1982). 

7  N G F  Function in  the  Aged  Brain 

In addition to the lesion-induced degeneration described above, severallabora(cid:173)
tories  have  demonstrated  that,  in  aged  animals  and  humans,  the  cholinergic 
neurons  of  the  basal  forebrain  are  compromised  (BARTUS  et al.  1982; 
WHITEHOUSE  et al.  1982). This compromise is  reflected in cell  shrinkage and, in 
some cases, loss of cholinergically marked neurons in the basal forebrain region, 
which seems  to correlate with a decrease in cognitive ability in animals (FISCHER 
et al.  1987)  and  humans  (COYLE  et al.  1983).  RNA  blotting  and  protein  data 
suggest a reduction ofNGF levels in the hippocampus of aged rats compared to 
the levels  in adult  rats (LARKFORS  et al.  1987). 

We  have  attempted  to  ameliorate  the  functional  deficits  and  reverse  the 
morphological  changes  observed  in  aged  animals  by  implanting  fetal  basal 
forebrain cells or by infusing NGF chronically into the aged brain. We initially 
reported and subsequently confirmed and extended the findings that transplant(cid:173)
ation  of fetal  cholinergic  neurons  to  the  hippocampal  formation  of aged  rats 
prescreened for cognitive impairments could result in substantial improvement in 
the previously impaired animal's behavior and that this was in part mediated via 
the cholinergic system (GAGE  et al.  1983;  GAGE  and  BJORKLUND  1986b).

Additionally, based on our initial observations of the trophic effect of NGF 
on cholinergic neurons in the retrograde degeneration model described above, we 
infused  NGF into  the  lateral  ventricles  of cognitively  impaired  aged  rats  and 
found  that  all  aged  rats  with  intact  NGF pumps  showed  an  improvement  in 
retention  of a  complex  spatial  learning  task  relative  to  matched,  noninfused, 
cognitively impaired rats (FISCHER et al.  1987). In the same study, we observed a 
significant increase in the size of the cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain 
region on the side of the brain into which the NGF was intraventricularly infused 
(Table  1). 

8  NGF Functions  as  a Tropic Factor 

In  addition  to  its  function  of  maintaining  the  normal  integrity  of  central 
cholinergic basal forebrain  neurons and  of peripheral sympathetic and  neural 
crest-derived sensory neurons (neurotrophic), NGF has been postulated to have a 
role in  the axonal growth of these neurons after damage to  the nervous system 
(neurotropic). Two forms of axonal growth are commonly observed in the mature 
hippocampus: regeneration,  or the regrowth  ofaxons previously damaged, and 
collateral sprouting,  or the  new  growth  of remaining (intact)  axons (GAGE  and 
BJORKLUND  1986b).  Collateral sprouting occurs  within  the  hippocampus from 
two  distinct  populations  of neurons  following  fimbria/fornix  transection.  Su(cid:173)
perior  cervical  ganglion  (SCG)-derived  sympathetic  axons,  which  normally 
surround  the  hippocampal  vasculature,  undergo  a  robust  sprouting  response 
into  the  dentate  gyrus  and  CA3  pyramidal  cell  region  of  the  hippocampal 
parenchyma (LoY and MOORE  1977; STENEVI and BJORKLUND  1978). In addition, 
the  magnocellular  midline  cholinergic  neurons  on  the  dorsal  hippocampal 
formation respond by sprouting into the dorsal subiculum and CAl  pyramidal 

Nerve Growth  Factor Function in the Central  Nervous System 

83 

cell layers (BLAKER et al. 1988). To test the postulate that NGF has tropic effects 
on cholinergic axons in the hippocampus and that the lesion-induced increase in 
NGF in the hippocampal formation may serve as a  chemoattractant of NGF(cid:173)
responsive  axons  towards  the  source  of its  production  (CRUTCHER  1987),  we 
examined  the  fl1l1bria/fornix  lesioned  hippocampal  formation  to  determine 
whether the sprouting neurons stain positively for NGFr. We found that the two 
populations of neurons which undergo collateral sprouting, namely, the midline 
magnocellular cholinergic neurons of the dorsal hippocampus and the sympathe(cid:173)
tic neurons of the SCG, stain strongly for  NGFr with  a  monoclonal antibody 
(TANIUcm et al.  1986, 1988). In contrast, the small intrinsic cholinergic neurons 
of the hippocampus exhibited neither sprouting response nor staining for NGFr 
(BATCHELOR  et al.  1989).  In view  of these  results  we  suggest  that the differing 
sprouting responses demonstrated by these three neuronal populations may be 
due to their responsiveness to NGF, as indicated by the presence or absence of 
NGFr. 

9  NGF Induces Regeneration in  the  eNS 

Attempts  to  restore  this  severed  fimbria/fornix  pathway  have  been  made  by 
grafting  fetal  tissue  or  other  substances  that  may  act  as  bridges  (TUSZYNSKI 
et al.  1990;  GAGE  et al.  1988b;  KROMER  et al.  1981)  between  the  disconnected 
septohippocampal  pathway.  Increases  in  ChAT  activity  and  AChE  fiber 
innervation in the host hippocampus have  been consistently reported in  these 
studies, but the extent of reinnervation is  small. 

A possible explanation for the limited restoration of the cholinergic circuitry 
may be that the majority of the cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and 
diagonal  band  of Broca  degenerate,  become  dysfunctional,  and  die  within  a 
month following  the  transection  (DAITZ  and  POWELL  1954;  GAGE  et al.  1986; 
ARMSTRONG  et al.  1987).  This  observation, and the evidence  of a  link  between 
NGF and  cholinergic  neurons  (HEUMANN  et al.  1985;  HONEGGER  and  LENOIR 
1982; SHELTON and REICHARDT  1986), have prompted several groups to test and 
subsequently  demonstrate  the  dependence  of  adult  denervated  cholinergic 
neurons  on exogenous  NGF for  survival  in  the  absence  of endogenous  NGF 
previously transported from  the hippocampus (GAGE  et al.  1988a; HEFTI  1986; 
KROMER  1987;  WILLIAMS  et al.  1986). 

These results led to the prediction that the exogenous delivery ofNGF could 
not only promote the survival of septal neurons, but also  would then promote 
cholinergic axon extension across a bridge of hippocampal fetal tissue placed in 
the fimbria/fornix  cavity.  Thus,  in a  recent  study we  combined  the  exogenous 
infusion ofNGF into the lateral ventricle adjacent to the denervated septum with 
the simultaneous grafting offetal hippocampal tissue to the fimbria/fornix cavity 
as a set of procedures that may more fully  and functionally  restore the severed 

84 

F. H.  Gage et al. 

septohippocampal circuitry (TUSZYNSKI  et al.  1990).  Embedded in the design of 
this study were two, additional, related questions: (1)  Does the transient 2 week 
NG F infusion period, which has been shown to result in significant cholinergic cell 
rescue, have an enduring effect on the medial septal cells 6-8 months following 
termination of the NGF infusion? (2) Will fetal hippocampal grafts alone, in the 
absence  of exogenous  NGF infusion,  support  the  survival  of the  axotpmized 
cholinergic neurons of the medial septum? 

A combination of intracerebral grafting and intraventricular infusion ofNGF 
was  used  to  attempt  reconstruction  of  the  cholinergic  component  of  the 
septohippocampal pathway following fimbria/fornix lesions.  Four groups were 
used: lesion only (FF); lesion and fetal hippocampal graft (FF-HPC); lesion and 
NGF  (FF-NGF);  and  lesion,  graft,  and  NGF  (FF-HPC-NGF).  ChAT  im(cid:173)
munoreactivity (ChAT-IR), AChE fiber staining, and behavior-dependent theta 
electrical activity were used to assess the extent of pathway reconstruction. The 
NGF  infusion  only  lasted  the  first  2  weeks  following  the  FF  lesion,  while 
measurement  of theta  activity  and  histological  analysis  were  conducted  6-8 
months after lesioning. Only the FF-HPC-NGF group had long-term rescue of 
ChAT-IR cells as compared to the FF and FF-HPC group. In addition, the FF(cid:173)
HPC-NGF group had more extensive reinnervation of the hippocampus than 
any other group. Further, the FF-HPC-NGF had the most complete evidence of 
behavior-dependent theta activity restoration. These results demonstrate clearly 
that  a  combination  of  short-term  intraventricular  NGF  infusion  and  fetal 
hippocampal grafts can result in a more complete reconstruction of the damaged 
septohippocampal circuit. 

10  A Role for  Glia in  Mediating the Tropic  Effects of NGF 

Damage  to  the  fimbria/fornix  and  separately  to  the  perforant  path  leads  to 
distinct and dramatic time dependent increases in glial fibrillary  acidic protein 
immunoreactivity (GFAR-IR) in  specific  areas  of the  hippocampal  formation 
(GAGE et al. 1988c). Specifically, FF lesions resulted in an increase in GF AP-IR in 
the pyramidal and stratum oriens layers of the CA3 region as well as in the inner 
molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. In addition, in the septum ipsilateral to the 
lesion, there was a rapid and robust increase in GFAP-IR in the dorsal lateral 
quadrant of the septum, but not in the medial septal region. Only after 30 days did 
GFAR-IR reach the medial septum. Following perforant path lesions, there was a 
selective increase in GF AP-IR in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. 
Most ofthese changes were transient and disappeared by 30 days post-lesion. We 
speculated that the increase in G F AP-IR, reflecting activation of astrocytic cells 
in these target areas, is  a necessary requirement for sprouting responses (GAGE 
et al.  1988c). 

Considerable in  vitro  and in vivo  evidence  supports  the· presumption that 
astrocytes make and secrete NTF which can subsequently support the survival 

Nerve Growth Factor Function in the Central Nervous System 

85 

and/or axonal outgrowth of a variety of central and peripheral neurons (BANKER 
1980; HATTEN and LIEM 1981; LIESI et al. 1984; LINDSAY 1979; TARRIS et al. 1986). 
At  present,  when  a  new  putative  factor  is  tested  in vitro  for  its  neurotrophic 
activity, rigorous controls must be used to establish that the neuronal population 
is not contaminated with glia and that the presumed NTF is not acting through 
the glial cell population in vitro. To date, the evidence supports the notion that 
only  reactive  and/or  proliferating  astrocytes  secrete  trophic  and  tropic  sub(cid:173)
stances; thus, it is essential to understand the signals for this activation in vivo. 
Microglial proliferation often precedes astrocytic proliferation (GALL et al.  1979; 
VIJAYAN  and COTMAN  1983).  Recently,  GIULIAN  et al.  (1986)  and  HETIER  et al. 
(1988) showed that activated microglia produce interleukin-1 (IL-1) in vitro and 
that IL-1  stimulates astrocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo (GIULIAN  et al. 
1988). Very recently it has been shown that IL-1 regulates the synthesis ofNGF in 
non-neuronal cells of the damaged rat sciatic nerve (LINDHOLM et al.  1987) and 
that IL-l  is most likely secreted from  activated macrophages in  the vicinity  of 
the damaged nerve (HEUMANN  et al.  1987b). 

Work in the CNS has demonstrated time dependent changes in microglial 
and  astrocytic  populations  in  the  outer  molecular  layer  of the  dentate  gyrus 
denervated by perforant path transection (FAGAN et al. 1988). Reactive microglia 
stained with the monoclonal antibody OX-42 appear in this area within 24 h after 
transection. The appearance of cells immunostained for IL-l in this area parallels 
that of microglia, suggesting that the reactive microglia themselves produce IL-l 
in vivo  in  response  to  deafferentation.  The  astrocyte  response,  as  indexed  by 
GF AP-IR,  is  not  observed  until  a  later  time  point  coincident  with  the 
disappearance  of  IL-l  staining.  These  observations  provide  evidence  that 
reactive microglia produce IL-l in vivo in response to injury and that IL-l may 
be  the  signal  responsible  for  the  docutnented  astrocyte  response  in  the  outer 
molecular layer of the dentate gyrus  observed  after damage  to  the  entorhinal 
input to the hippocampus. 

11  Working  Hypothesis of NGF Effects 

The results of data summarized in the previous sections suggest: (1) a role for IL-l in 
the proliferation of astrocytes, (2) that activated microglia and macrophages can 
secrete IL-l, and (3) that IL-l can activate NGF synthesis in non-neuronal cells. 
We have made the following suggestion for the outline of events that lead to the 
NGF-sensitive  sprouting 
the  hippocampus  and  septum 
following  fimbria/fornix  and perforant pathway lesions. 

responses 

in 

Perforant pathway damage  induces  terminal degeneration  of the axons  of 
cells which were transected in the entorhinal cortex. This terminal degeneration 
in  the  outer  molecular  layer  of  the  dentate  gyrus  activates  microglia  to 
phagocytize  in  the  restricted  zone  of terminal  degeneration.  These  activated 

86 

F. H.  Gage et al. 

microglia  release  IL-l  into  the  surrounding  environment,  which  induces  the 
proliferation of astrocytes. The activated astrocytes, in turn, secrete NGF which 
results  in  the  attraction  of  cholinergic  fibers  that  express  NGFr  on  their 
membrane surfaces. 

Similarly,  following  fimbria/fornix  lesions,  cholinergic  terminals  are  dis(cid:173)
connected from their cell bodies in the septum and, once again, there is terminal 
degeneration, this time in the areas of heaviest cholinergic innervation in the CA3 
region and dentate gyrus. This degeneration leads to a microglial proliferation, 
IL-l secretion, and an astrocytic mitogenic reaction in CA3 and inner molecular 
layer of the dentate gyrus. The activated astrocytes secrete NGF and promote the 
ingrowth of NGFr-bearing sympathetic fibers  of the SCG. 

Concurrently in the septum, degeneration of terminals from the hippocampus 
to the dorsolateral quadrant results in microglial reactivity and subsequent IL-l 
secretion, proliferation of glia, and increased NGF concentration. This, in turn, 
induces  the  growth  of cholinergic  fibers  from  the  medial  septum,  which  are 
undergoing retrograde degeneration, into the dorsolateral quadrant. This NGF 
source  in  the  dorsolateral  quadrant is  not  sufficient  to  support all  the  medial 
cholinergic cells, but some of the medial septal cells are always spared even with a 
complete  bilateral  fimbria/fornix  lesion.  Meanwhile,  the  absence  of  reactive 
astrocytes  in  the  medial  septum  soon  after  the  fimbria/fornix  lesion  is  the 
paramount reason for the death of these cells, because, as in development, these 
cells  survive  only in the presence of adequate glia-derived NGF. 

This working hypothesis generates several specific testable predictions, which 
when examined should reveal more about the mechanisms underlying survival, 
growth,  and  function  of  normal  and  damaged  cholinergic  neurons  in  the 
CNS. 

12  Conclusions 

Based on this  review,  the following  points summarize our knowledge  of NGF 
function in the CNS: 

1.  NGF is synthesized in target areas ofthe projecting cholinergic neurons of the 

forebrain. 

2.  NGFr is  synthesized in  basal forebrain  cholinergic  projecting  neurons  and 
anterogradely  transported  to  its  terminals  in  target  areas  which  produce 
NGF. 

3.  Survival  of  the  projecting  basal  forebrain  neurons  is  dependent  on  the 

retrograde transport of NGF to  basal forebrain  neurons. 

4.  Disconnection of the projecting neurons from the targets results in retrograde 
degeneration which can be  reversed  by  exogenous administration of NGF. 
5.  NGF  exogenous  infusion  can  also  promote  axonal  regrowth,  provided  a 

substrate for  axonal growth  is  available.

6.  NGF appears to have a positive effect on its own receptors, such that increased 
levels  of  NGF  result  in  increased  expression  of  NGFr  and  increased 
responsiveness  to  NGF. 

7.  In the aged rat with cognitive impairments in behavior which are correlated 
with  cholinergic  cell  size  and  number,  chronic  NGF infusion  can  result  in 
improved behavioral performance and partial restoration of cholinergic cell 
size. 

8.  While NGF appears to be synthesized in  neurons of the intact target areas, 
damage-induced activated astroglia may also have the ability  to  synthesize 
and secrete  NGF. 

9.  IL-l may regulate NGF expression and activate astrocytes; this regulation of 
NGF may  contribute to  sprouting  responses  of cholinergic  neurons  in  the 
CNS. 

While  a  complete  understanding  of NGF  regulation  and  function  is  not 
available,  both  a  trophic  and  tropic  role  for  NGF  exists  in  the  eNS.  The 
specificity  of NGF for  cholinergic  neurons,  while  not  perhaps  exact,  may  be 
unique  in  its  specificity.  To  date,  the  other candidate neurotrophic  molecules 
have a  broader range  of function.  Thus  while  NGF may  be  the first  and  best 
characterized NTF, it may not be the prototype for other trophic factors in the 
CNS.

1  Introduction 

The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of peptide growth factors that 
share  a  number  of  biochemical  and  biological  properties.  The  FGFs  were 
originally identified as peptides containing mitogenic activity for fibroblasts and 
existing at high levels in brain extracts (GOSPODAROWICZ  1974).  We now know 
that  the  members  of the  FGF gene  family  can  regulate  a  number  of distinct 
biological activities. The group of proteins that are known as the FG Fs has been

discovered,  rediscovered,  and  purified  under  a  number  of  different  names 
reflecting either the  tissue  of origin  or the  biological activity  that was  used  to 
monitor  their  purification  (for  a  partial  list  see  GOSPODAROWICZ  et al.  1987). 
From the work of a number of laboratories dating from  1983, it as now become 
apparent that members of the FGF family, in addition to their other biological 
effects, are potent neural growth factors that have specific effects on the division, 
differentiation, and survival of specific classes of nerve cells. This review will focus 
on the effects of the FGFs on nerve cells, but the reader should clearly be aware 
that  these  peptides  affect  a  number  of other cell  types  and  that  a  meaningful 
understanding of their role in development and differentiation can occur only in 
the context of the constellation of effects  under control of these  molecules. 

2  The  FGF Family of Growth  Factors 

It was  originally  proposed  that  FGF was  a  fragment  of myelin  basic  protein 
(WESTALL et al.  1978), but this conclusion was shown to be incorrect by THOMAS 
(1980).  Subsequently,  the purification of FGF was  pursued  using  a  number of 
different procedures, but the extremely rapid development of this field  over the 
last few  years can be traced to  the realization that the  FGFs have the unusual 
property of binding strongly to heparin affinity columns (SHING et al.  1984). This 
discovery soon led to their purification. The novel property of binding to heparin 
affinity columns at very high salt concentrations also led a number of different 
groups, working on what were thought to be distinct biological activities, to do 
experiments demonstrating that they were actually working on the same protein 
or class of proteins. The names for  these proteins included those that reflected 
their  tissue  of  origin  (e.g.,  retinal  derived  growth  factor)  or  their  biological 
activities (e.g., astroglial growth factor). In a review ofthe heparin binding growth 
factors, which summarizes the evidence that there were only two gene products in 
the  FGF  family,  LOBB  et al.  (1986)  suggested  that  the  FGFs  might  more 
appropriately  be  called  the  heparin  binding  growth  factors  (HBGFs)  both 
because of the obvious affinity of these growth factors  for  heparin and because 
heparin in many cases modulates their biological activity. In this review, we will 
use  the more popular, but more misleading name,  FGF. 

As suggested by LOBB et al. (1986), the FGFs can be divided into two classes 
on  the  basis  of their  heparin  affinities.  The  class  1 HBGFs  were  eluted  from 
heparin affinity columns at between 1 and 1.2 M  salt and had a pI between 5 and 
5.8.  As  a result these growth factors  are frequently  and  most commonly called 
acidic FGF (aFGF). The class 2 HBGFs also bound heparin affinity columns but 
were eluted between 1.5 and 2 M  salt. Because of their basic pI (between 9.2 and 
9.8), this class of growth factors is most commonly called the basic FGFs (bFGF). 
aFGF had been studied under at least nine distinct names including astroglial 
growth factor type 1, endothelial cell growth factor, retinal derived growth factor, 

The Fibroblast Growth Factors 

97 

and eye derived growth factor 2. Likewise, bFGF had been studied under at least 
23  different names including astroglial growth factor 2, endothelial cell growth 
factor,  hepatoma growth factor, eye derived growth factor  1,  pituitary derived 
growth factor, and chondrocytoma growth factor (for a more complete list and a 
historical perspective see  GOSPODAROWICZ  et al.  1987). 

On  the  basis  of the  sequence  information  of the  peptides  and  the  cross(cid:173)
reactivity  between the two cDNAs, a  cDNA for  both a- and bFGF has  been 
isolated (JAYE et al.  1986, human; ABRAHAM  et al.  1986, bovine; SHIMASAKI et al. 
1988, rat). This work confirmed that aFGF and bFGF were actually the product 
of only two distinct genes, one corresponding to bFGF and the other to aFGF. 
Analysis of these cDNAs suggested that the primary translation product of both 
a- and bFGF was a  155 amino acid polypeptide containing no signal sequence 
and that these peptides were about 55% homologous. Furthermore, the genes for 
a- and bFGF are found on different human chromosomes (chromosome 5 and 
chromosome 4, respectively, MERGIA et al.  1986). Thus, by 1986, it was clear that 
many of the endothelial cell growth factors and 3T3 cell growth factors that had 
been isolated from a number of tissues were products of one of the two genes that 
encoded  aFGF  and  bFGF.  The  existence  of high  molecular  weight  forms  of 
bFGF (e.g., MOSCATELLI et al.  1987) that contained an N-terminal extension was 
explained by the demonstration that a mRNA for bFGF could be translated to 
produce three different species of bFGF (18,  21,  and 22.5 kDa), with the larger 
forms  resulting from  translational initiation at an in-frame CUG (PRATS  et al. 
1989).  No significant  biological  differences  have  yet  been reported among the 
different species of bFGF. 

The family  of FGFs,  however,  grew  rapidly  with  the  discovery  that  three 
distinct oncogene-related proteins are homologous to bFGF: (a)  An oncogene 
has been isolated from  Kaposi's sarcoma which  encodes  a  growth factor  that 
is a member of the FGF family (BOVI and BASILICO  1987; BOVI et al.  1987, 1988) 
and maps to human chromosome 11 (HUEBNER et al. 1988). Unlike a- and bFGF 
the oncogene isolated from Kaposi's sarcoma (K-FGF) expresses a peptide that 
is  cleaved after  a  signal  sequence,  glycosylated,  and secreted.  The media from 
K-FGF transformed  cells  contained  an  FGF-like activity,  and  K-FGF trans(cid:173)
formed  3T3  cells  grew  in serum free  media.  The  human  stomach  tumor (hst) 
oncogene (YOSHIDA  et al.  1987) is  virtually identical to K-FGF (BOVI et al.  1988). 
(2)  The  int 2  gene,  a  site  where  integration  of mouse  mammary  tumor  virus 
frequently leads to cell transformation and the development of a tumor, encodes a 
protein that is homologous to the FGFs (SMITH et al.  1988). Normally, the int 2 
gene is thought to be expressed only during early embryonic development, but 
aberrant expression of this gene in response to activation by mouse mammary 
tumor  virus  results  in  the  development  of mammary  tumors.  (3)  The  FGF-5 
oncogene encodes a  protein that is  homologous to other members of the FGF 
gene  family  and  whose  expression  and  secretion  can  apparently  lead  to 
transformation (ZHAN et al.  1988). Thus the family of FGFs includes at least five 
distinct members, two of which have been isolated as oncogenes and one of which 
(int 2)  is  clearly related to cell  transformation.

3  Regulation of Neural Differentiation 

and Survival  by  the  FGFs 

3.1  PC12 Cells 

The first demonstration of an effect of the FGF family on neural differentiation 
was  made by TOGARI  who showed that bFGF stimulated neurite outgrowth in 
PC12  cells  (TOGARI  et al.  1983,  1985).  These  papers  reported  that  the  initial 
response  of  PC12  cells  to  bFGF  was  initially  comparable  to  that  of NGF; 
however, in contrast to NGF, the  FGF dependent neurites were  transient and 
FGF failed  to  cause  an  increase  in  acetylcholinesterase  activity.  These  initial 
differences between the activity ofbFGF and NGF on PC12 cells have not been 
substantiated by subsequent work (TOGARI et al. 1985; RYDEL and GREENE  1987; 
J.  WAGNER,  unpublished work),  and it now appears that NGF and FGF exert 
essentially  identical  effects  on  the  differentiation  of  PC12  cells,  including  the 
stimulation of cell-substratum adhesion (SCHUBERT  et al.  1987). 

The  first  demonstration  that  aFGF  could  also  stimulate  differentiation 
of  neural  cells  was  also  made  in  the  PC12  cell  system.  The  morphological 
effects  of aFGF,  purified  under  the  name  retina  derived  growth  factor,  were 
indistinguishable at the light microscope level from those ofNGF and NGF and 
aNGF elicited  process formation  with  similar kinetics.  Most interestingly,  the 
potency of aFGF was increased  100-fold by the addition of exogenous heparin 
(WAGNER and D' AMORE 1986). Subsequently, heparin has been shown to strongly 
potentiate the activity of aFGF in all cases where neural differentiation is effected. 
Thus, the ability of heparin not only to bind to members of the FGF family, but 
also to modulate their biological activity is a common theme whose underlying 
biological meaning must certainly  become clearer as  the  biological  role  of the 
FGFs in  neural development  and differentiation is  elucidated. 

3.1.1  Heparin Potentiation in  PC12 Cells 

Presumably the ability of these growth factors to associate with heparin reflects a 
biologically  important association  of the growth factor  with  an endogenously 
occurring  glycosaminoglycan.  Modification  of  FGF  action  by  sulfated  gly(cid:173)
cosaminoglycans is a complex phenomenon, and its physiological meaning and 
biochemical  mechanism  will  certainly  be  difficult  to  unravel.  Heparin-like 
glycosaminoglycans  (GAGs)  may  occur  either  at  the  cell  surface  or  as  a 
component of the extracellular matrix.  Either of these possibilities would have 
potentially interesting implications for the control of process outgrowth or nerve 
regeneration. 

Modification ofFGF activity is not limited to the effects of heparin on aFGF; 
other sulfated GAGs including heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondrot(cid:173)
in sulfate can strongly modify the activity of both aFGF and/or bFGF (DAMON 
et al.  1988).  Since  these  effects  appear to  be  dependent  both  on  the  particular 

The  Fibroblast Growth  Factors 

99 

GAG  used  and  the  particular growth  factor  used,  it  seems  apparent  that  the 
effects of these sulfated sugar polymers probably result from an interaction with 
the growth factor  rather than  by  a  nonspecific effect  on the cell  (DAMON  et al. 
1988).  NEUFELD  et al.  (1987)  confirmed  that  heparin  increased  the  potency  of 
aFGF but not NGF on PC12 cells but also reported a complex effect of heparin 
on  the  biological activity  of bFGF. They reported  that heparin stimulated the 
biological activity oflow concentrations ofbFGF while it inhibited the biological 
activity  of  high  concentrations  of  bFGF.  How  those  experiments  can  be 
reconciled with the observations of DAMON  et al. (1988)  is  not readily apparent 
but may be due to methodological differences.  SCHUBERT et al. (1987) made the 
intriguing  observation  that  bFGF,  when  absorbed  to  an  extracellular  matrix 
which contained GAGs, caused  the formation  of aggregates  or circles  of PC12 
cells. 

The  ability  of heparin  to  potentiate  the  action  of aFGF on  PC12  cells  in 
culture may, to a large extent, be explained by the ability of heparin to extend the 
biological half-life of this growth factor (DAMON et al. 1989) and probably reflects 
the ability of heparin to stabilize a- and bFGF in vitro both to heat inactivation 
and protease attack (GOSPODAROWICZ and CHENG  1986). The varying potencies 
of aFGF and bFGF may be at least partially due to a differential sensitivity to 
proteases  (LOBB  1988;  DAMON  et al.  1989).  The  100-fold  inhibition  of  bFGF 
activity by heparan sulfate (DAMON et al. 1989) must have a different explanation, 
possibly as simple as a masking of the biological activity ofFGF by binding to the 
growth factor.  Since the biological potency of the FG Fs is strongly modified by 
the presence of GAGs and proteases, a full understanding of the role of the FG Fs 
will  undoubtedly require an understanding not only of the production of these 
factors, but also an understanding of the ways proteases and GAGs can modify 
expression  of their biological  activity. 

3.2  Chromaffin  Cells 

Chromaffin  cells,  which  share  many  properties  with  PC12  cells  including  the 
ability  to  respond  to  NGF  both  by  dividing  and  by  differentiating  into  a 
sympathetic  nerve-like  cells,  also  respond  to  bFGF (STEMPLE  et al.  1988)  and 
aFGF (CLAUDE et al.  1988). The study of the FGFs in chromaffin cells, which, in 
contrast to PC12 cells, are not an established cell line, has revealed an extremely 
interesting  difference  between  the  biological  activity  of NGF  and  the  FGFs. 
While NGF is both a differentiation factor and a long-term survival factor for the 
sympathetic nerve-like cells  that are derived from  chromaffin cells,  both aFGF 
and bFGF appear to be able to initiate their differentiation and stimulate their 
proliferation without acting as  long-term survival factors  (STEMPLE  et al.  1988; 
CLAUDE et al.  1988). In fact, the differentiated cells that result from  the action of 
bFGF apparently become dependent on NGF for continued survival (STEMPLE 
et al.  1988). Dexamethasone antagonizes the neurite outgrowth elicited by NGF, 
aFGF, and bFGF; while dexamethasone inhibits the NGF-induced, but not the 

100 

J. A.  Wagner 

FGF -induced, proliferation ofthese cells (STEMPLE et al. 1988; CLAUDE et al. 1988). 
This points to another important difference between NGF and FGF dependent 
pathways  and  leads  to  the  suggestion  that  NGF  and  the  FGFs  may  serve 
different functions during development. For example, in the adrenal gland, bFGF 
or aFGF may be  the stimulus  that allows  amplification  of the chromaffin cell 
population, while the presence of glucocorticoids prevents neural differentiation. 
Likewise, the FGFs could conceivably be involved in the initial differentiation 
and neurite  formation  of sympathoblasts,  while  NGF may  play  the  role  of a 
maturation factor or a  survival factor. 

3.3  Peripheral Nerves 

Unlike NGF, the FGFs do not appear to have the ability to act as survival factors 
for  sympathetic  nerve  cells  (UNSICKER  et al.  1987).  Both  aFGF  and  bFGF, 
however, stimulate survival and neurite outgrowth from chick ciliary ganglion 
cells,  which  are  parasympathetic,  and  the  effects  of  aFGF  are  strongly 
potentiated by  heparin (UNSICKER  et al.  1987;  SCHUBERT  et al.  1987).  Thus, in 
vitro,  aFGF  and  bFGF  have  properties  that  strongly  suggest  they  are 
neurotrophic factors  and neurite extension factors for cells from the peripheral 
nervous systems but in vivo evidence for this assertion is still required. The FGFs 
and NGF appear to influence an overlapping but distinct population of cells, and 
they appear to act by biochemical mechanisms that are at least partially distinct. 

3.4  Nerves from  the  Central Nervous System 

The  FGFs,  which  are  present  in  high  concentrations  in  the  central  nervous 
system, also stimulate the survival and/or differentiation of a  number of mixed 
populations of nerves from different regions of the CNS. bFGF is both a survival 
factor and a  neurite extension factor for cortical neurons and purified hippoc(cid:173)
ampal neurons, but not cerebellar neurons (MORRISON et al. 1986; WALICKE et al. 
1986; MORRISON et al.  1988); however, in the case of hippocampal cells, it is clear 
that  factors  other  than  FGF  must  also  be  required  for  long-term  survival. 
Although bFGF obviously has effects on non-neural cells that are present in these 
cultures, it is most likely that the effects of FGF are directly on the population of 
neural cells  (WALICKE  and  BAIRD  1988).  A  survey  of the  effects  of aFG hand 
bFGF on several  areas  of the  brain by  W ALICKE  (1988)  has  shown  that  both 
aFGF and bFGF are potent neurotrophic factors for a variety of populations of 
cells  from  many different  regions  of the  brain.  In  particular, bFGF increased 
survival of cells from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, parietal 
cortex,  occipital  cortex,  striatum,  septum,  and  thalamus,  but  not  from  the 
subiculum.  Interestingly,  aFGF supported  a  smaller  number  of neurons from 
each area where bFGF had an effect, and, in contrast to bFGF, aFGF increased 
survival of a  population of nerves from  the subiculum. This data suggests that 

The Fibroblast Growth  Factors 

101 

aFGF and bFGF influence nonidentical populations of nerve cells and may act 
through different receptors (W ALICKE  1988a). 

bFGF also  enhanced  the  survival  of a  population of spinal  cord  neurons 
including some  motor neurons (UNSICKER  et al.  1987).  bFGF also  appears  to 
modestly  stimulate the proliferation  of neuronal  precursor cells  (GENSBURGER 
et al. 1987) and enhances both the survival and morphological differentiation of a 
population  of fetal  rat brain  cells  including  oligodendrocytes,  astrocytes,  and 
some neurons (ECCLESTON  et al.  1985). 

FGFs also  have striking effects  on several definitively identified neural cell 
types. bFGF maintains the viability and promotes the differentiation of a purified 
population  of granule  ceHs(HATTEN  et al.  1988).  Astroglial  cells  can maintain 
granule neurons in culture in the absence of exogenous bFGF, and this effect 
appears to  be  mediated, at least in part, by astroglial derived  bFGF (HATTEN 
et al.  1988).  aFGF  also  enhanced  the  regeneration  of retinal  ganglion  cells 
(LIPTON  et al.  1988)  at  a  time  when  there  was  no  obvious  effect  on  survival; 
however, future experiments will be required to assess the role of aFGF in long(cid:173)
term survival of these cells. The biological potency of aFGF on retinal ganglion 
cells  was  markedly  potentiated  by  heparin  and,  interestingly,  there  was  no 
apparent effect ofbFGF on these cells. Retinal ganglion cells stand as one of two 
examples of a neural cell type that responds to aFGF but not bFGF (with the 
aFGF  responsive  population  in  the  subiculum  being  the  other  [W ALICKE 
1988a, b]). Statistical analysis demonstrates that aFGF can contribute to both 
neurite  elongation  and  initiation  by  retinal  ganglion  cells.  Finally,  aFGF 
enhances both the survival and the expression of opsin by retinal photoreceptor 
cells (HICKS and COURTOIS 1988), and FGF increase the synthesis of prolactin by 
GH3 cells,  a  pituitary derived  tumor line (MoRMEDE  and BAIRD  1988). 

Thus,  in  a  rapidly increasing  number of cases,  either defined  cell  types  or 
populations of cells that include multiple types of neurons from either the central 
or peripheral nervous system have been shown to respond to aFGF and/or bFGF 
with enhanced survival and/or neurite formation. Since the FGFs can clearly act 
as survival factors, it remains possible that their effects on neurite formation by 
these cell  types  may sometimes  be  a  secondary effect  of their enhancement  of 
survival. Thus, it will be prudent to be aware of these possible complications in 
designing future experiments. Nevertheless, the fact that both aFGF and bFGF 
have been shown to stimulate the differentiation of a transformed cell line that 
does not depend on FGF for survival (PCI2 cells) certainly supports the idea that 
these  growth  factors  may  have  effects  on  the  expression  of  differentiated 
characteristics beyond their effects  on cell survival. 

3.5  Astrocytes and  Oligodendrocytes 

Basic FGF has long been known to be an essential component of a chemically 
defined media for  astrocytes (MORRISON  and DE  VELLIS  1981),  and bFGF can 
stimulate quiescent astrocytes to re-enter the cell cycle (KNISS and BURRY  1988). 

102 

J. A.  Wagner 

PETTMANN  et al.  (1985)  purified  two  astrocyte  mitogens  from  brain  (astroglial 
growth factor  1 and astroglial growth factor 2)  which correspond to aFGF and 
bFGF, respectively. In addition to stimulating the division of astrocytes, a- and 
bFG F stimulate the acquisition of a star-like morphology that is characteristic of 
mature astrocytes and increase the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, a 
marker of mature astrocytes (PERRAUD et al.  1988; MORRISON et al.  1985). bFGF 
stimulates  the  synthesis  of plasminogen  activator  (ROGISTER  et al.  1988).  The 
responses of astrocytes to aFGF were somewhat different from the responses to 
bFGF. At the  ultrastructural level,  aFGF was  more effective  at increasing the 
expression of neurofilaments while bFG F had a greater effect on the abundance 
of micro tubules, leading to the suggestion that aFGF and bFGF may act through 
distinct  signal  transduction  systems  in  astrocytes  (PERRAUD  et al.  1988).  It is 
unclear if the effects of the FG Fs on the expression of the differential phenotype 
by astrocytes is due to an FGF requirement for their survival in culture or if either 
of  the  FGFs  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  differentiation  of  these  cells;  thus, 
experiments that distinguish the effects of aFG F and bFG F on survival, division, 
and  differentiation  will  be  of great  interest.  The  astrocytoma  line,  U87-MG, 
expresses  bFGF and the  expression  of the  gene  is  regulated  by  serum,  by  the 
activity of protein kinase C  and, apparently, by  cell-cell  contact, suggesting an 
autocrine role for the growth factor (MURPHY et al.  1988a, b).  Such a regulatory 
pattern, if found in normal astrocytes, would explain the  relatively low level  of 
FGF  expression  normally  observed,  and  it  would  be  consistent  with  the 
suggestion  that  bFGF is  expressed  in  response  to  tissue  damage  and  that  its 
expression is  involved in coordinating tissue  repair or remodeling  after injury. 
FGF also stimulates the primitive neural mouse cell line F7 to differentiate into 
an oligodendrocyte-like cell type, as indicated by changes in cell morphology and 
the expression of carbonic anhydrase and myelin  basic protein, supporting the 
idea that the FGFs may playa role in producing the oligodendrocyte cell lineage 
(DE  VITRY  et al.  1983). 

4  Effects of the  FGFs on  Nerve  Regeneration 

and  Cell Survival  In  Vivo 

Acidic  FGF  stimulated  an  increase  in  the  number  of myelinated  axons  that 
regenerated across a transected sciatic nerve. This increase was due largely to an 
increase  in  the  number  of sensory,  and  to  some  extent,  motor  neurons  that 
extended  axons  into  the  distal  stump (CORDEIRO  et al.  1989).  This  increase  in 
nerve regeneration may be due, at least in part, to the ability of FGF to protect 
adult sensory nerves from lesion-induced cell death (OTTO et al.  1987). Likewise, 
administration of bFGF has been shown to enhance the survival of cholinergic 
neurons in  the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca after transection of 
their axons (ANDERSON et al.  1988). Thus, the FGFs are clearly capable of acting 

The  Fibroblast Growth Factors 

103 

as survival factors in vivo substantiating the observations that have been made in 
culture and strengthening the hypothesis that they are important neurotrophic 
factors that act to maintain an appropriate number of mature neurons in vivo. 

5  Expression  of aFGF and  bFGF in  Neural Tissue 

Basic FGF has been isolated from a broad range of cell types and tissues while 
aFGF  has  been  isolated  only  in  nerve  and  a  few  other  tissue  types  (see 
GOSPODAROWICZ  et al.  1987  for  a  review).  On  the  basis  of immunochemical 
localizations  bFGF  is  thought  to  be  found  (although  it  is  not  necessarily 
synthesized) in neurons (FINKLESTEIN  et al.  1988;  PETTMANN  et al.  1986;  JANET 
et al.  1987). The expression of bFGF and aFGF can be dramatically increased 
after focal  brain injury (FINKLESTEIN  et al.  1988;  NIETO-SAMPEDRO  et al.  1988), 
and  bFGF  appears  to  be  localized  at  the  border  of the  lesion  in  a  cell  that 
resembles a reactive astrocyte (FINKLESTEIN  et al.  1988).  SHIMASAKI  et al.  (1988) 
have shown that bFGF mRNA is expressed in cortex and hypothalamus, but is 
below detectable levels in a number of non-neural tissues from which bFGF can 
be purified. This suggests either that the high level ofbFGF found in these non(cid:173)
neural tissues is due to storage of the mitogen or that bFGF is synthesized only 
under specific circumstances by these tissues. The expression of bFGF in brain, 
where cell division and neovascularization are rare, is also of interest because it 
highlights  the idea that one of bFGF's major roles  may  be  to regulate  neural 
function.  bFGF is  also produced in several classes  of cells in culture including 
retinal  pigment  epithelia  (SCHWEIGERER  et al.  1987),  pituitary  cells  (FERRARA 
et al. 1987), epithelial cells (MOSCATELLI et al. 1986), vascular smooth muscle cells 
(WINKLES et al. 1987), and astrocytes (discussed above); however, the observation 
that bFGF production is regulated in astrocytes by their position in the cell cycle 
emphasizes  that  observations  made  in  cell  culture  should  not  be  carelessly 
extrapolated to in vivo situations. aFGF is expressed in brain and retina (ALTERIO 
et al.  1988),  but  the  apparent  need  to  purify  poly  A +  RNA  to  identify  the 
transcripts  testifies  to  its  lack  of  abundance.  It is  clearly  of  importance  to 
determine  which  cells  in  the  nervous  system  express  the  FGFs,  how  that 
expression changes with development, and how environmental factors (such as 
injury, change of synaptic input, anoxia,  or cell  death) regulate its expression. 

6  Effects of the  FGFs on  Non-Neural Cells 

In contrast to NGF, which was originally described as a neurotrophic factor and 
only later came to be recgonized as a molecule that could influence the behavior 
of non-neuronal cells, the study of FG Fs' effects on nerves and other cells in the 

104 

J.  A.  Wagner 

nervous system takes place in the context of the realization that FGFs have a 
number of significant effects on other cell types. Although it is impossible for this 
review  to describe  these biological effects  in  any  detail, a  brief list of the  most 
significant observations seems essential. 

6.1  The FGFs as Oncogenes 

Given that the original assays that led to the purification and characterization of 
the FGFs were based on the ability of these molecules to act as mitogens for a 
number of cell types, most prominently fibroblasts and endothelial cells, it was 
initially suprising that FGFs or FGF-like gene products were never isolated as 
oncogenes. This apparent paradox has been resolved by the isolation of at least 
three members of the FGF family  (K-FGF/hst,  int2,  and FGF-5) as oncogenes 
(BOVI  et al.  1987; SMITH et al.  1988; YOSHIDA  et al.  1987; ZHAN  et al.  1988).  The 
failure of the focus-forming assays to isolate genes corresponding to aFGF and 
bF..GF  may  be  partially  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  expression  or  overex(cid:173)
pression  of  these  genes  can  confer  a  partially  transformed,  but  not  a  fully 
transformed,  phenotype  (JAYE  et al.  1988;  NEUFELD  et al.  1988;  SASADA  et al. 
1988).  bFGF itself may  be  unable  to contribute strongly  to  tumor formation 
because it is not released efficiently into the medium in its native state; however, 
modification of the gene by the addition of a signal sequence leads to a form  of 
bFGF  that  can  induce  a  transformed  phenotype,  including  the  formation  of 
tumors (ROGEL]  et al.  1988).  It is  of some interest that antibodies of bFGF can 
actually  inhibit  the  growth  of  pulmonary  endothelial  cells,  suggesting  an 
autocrine role for  bFGF (SAKAGucm  et al.  1988).  Thus, as  would be expected 
from  their  biological  properties,  the  expression  of  altered  FGFs  or  the 
inappropriate expression of the FGFs can result in tumor formation.  Likewise, 
the appreciation of the potential of the FGFs to contribute to the transformed 
phenotype will  undoubtedly lead to a  more detailed  definition  of their role  in 
tumor progression in the near future (for a recent review see THOMAS 1988). A role 
for the FGFs in the development of neural tumors has not yet been established. 
It should  not  be  forgotten  that  the  FGFs  may  also  contribute  to  tumor 
progression  by  virtue  of their  ability  to  act  as  endothelial  cell  mitogens  and 
angiogenic factors  leading to increased vascularization, an essential step in the 
development  of a  clinically  significant  tumor  (for  a  review  see  FOLKMAN  and 
KLAGSBRUN  1987). 

6.2  The  FGFs as Inducing  Factors During Embryogenesis 

The  FGFs  have  also  been  implicated  in  the  regulation  of  early  embryonic 
development in Xenopus. SLACK et al. (1987) reported that bFGF can mimic the 
ventrovegetal  signal  that  is  essential  for  induction  of  mesodermal  tissue. 
Furthermore, the natural ventrovegetal signal can be blocked by heparin, which 

The Fibroblast Growth  Factors 

105 

could bind secreted FGF and reduce its concentration, further suggesting that a 
HBGF such as bFGF may be the inducer. Of course, the existence of a family of 
FGF-like  molecules  makes  any  such  assignment  premature.  Nevertheless,  the 
data is extremely suggestive and exciting and will  certainly help to more clearly 
identify  the  essential  endogenous  signals  and  the  sights  of  their  synthesis.  A 
mRNA encoding a protein with very strong homology to bFGF has  also been 
isolated from Xenopus, and the FG Fs, in conjunction with other peptide growth 
factors,  have  been  shown  to  strongly  stimulate  the  expression  of mesodermal 
markers  (KIMELMAN  and  KIRSCHNER  1987;  KIMELMAN  et al.  1988).  Int-2  is 
expressed in  a  number of tissues  during embryonic development including the 
neuroepithelium, suggesting that this member of the FGF family may playa role 
in  the  early  development  of  the  nervous  system  (WILKINSON  et al.  1988; 
JAKOBOVITS  et al.  1986). 

6.3  The  FGFs as  Mitogens 

The  FGFs  were  originally  purified  and  identified  by  their  ability  to  act  as 
mitogens  on a  number of cell  types,  most  prominently fibroblasts,  endothelial 
cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes; more recently, they have been shown to 
be  mitogens  for  neuroblasts,  keratinocytes,  bovine  epithelial  lens  cells,  ost(cid:173)
eoblasts,  and melanocytes  (e.g.,  LOBB  et al.  1986;  GOSPODAROWICZ  et al.  1986; 
PETTMANN et al.  1985;  O'KEEFE et al.  1988;  RISTOW  and MESSMER  1988;  ROD AN 
et al.  1987;  GLOBUS  et al.  1988;  CANALIS  et al.  1988;  MOENNER  et al.  1986; 
HALABAN  et al.  1988a, b;  Wu et al.  1988). 

6.4  The  FGFs as  Differentiation Factors in  Non-Neural Cells 

The  FGFs  regulate  the  differentiation  or  expression  of  the  differentiated 
phenotype  of a  number  of non-neural  cells.  For  example:  (1)  The  FGFs  are 
implicated at several steps in muscle differentiation. FGF deprivation induces the 
formation of post-mitotic cells from  proliferating myoblasts and FGF addition 
both  delays  the  onset  of  myotube  formation  and  can  actually  reverse  the 
expression of muscle specific RNAs by a mechanism that is distinguishable from 
the  effect  of FGF on myoblast  proliferation.  The muscle  colony  forming  cells 
(chick stage 23 to 27) require FGF to differentiate, while loss ofthe FGF receptor 
is  correlated with  the  generation of a  post-mitotic state (SEED  and  HAUSCHKA 
1988;  SPITZ  et al.  1986;  HAUSCHKA  et al.  1987;  KARDAMI  et al.  1988).  (2)  FGF 
plays an important role in the maturation of ovarian granulosa cells by blocking 
follicle  stimulating hormone dependent increases  in  aromatase activity (BAIRD

7  Regulation  of aFGF and  bFGF Activity 

by  Heparin-Like  Molecules and  Proteases 

One ofthe distinguishing characteristics of the FGF family is that they all appear 
to retain the ability to bind strongly to heparin in such way that the binding can 
be  disrupted  only  at extremely  high  salt  concentrations.  This  strong  physical 
interaction of the  FGFs with heparin is  reflected  by  the ability of heparin  and 
heparin-like molecules to strongly modify the biological activity of these growth 
factors.  I  know of no other case in which a well-defined growth factor has been 
demonstrated  to  associate  so  strongly  with  a  known  component  of  the 
extracellular matrix;  and  there is  a  clear interaction between cells  and compo(cid:173)
nents of the extracellular matrix during neurite formation, (e.g., TOMASELLI et aL 
1987; EDGAR et aL  1984; LANDER et aL  1982). Thus, it is worth considering both 
the  effects  of heparin  on  the  biological  activities  of  these  molecules  and  the 
possible biological meaning of the retention of this strong heparin avidity in  a 
family of growth factors. Certainly it is unlikely that the strong association of the 
FGFs with  heparin and/or heparin-like molecules is  purely  an accident;  more 
likely, the ability to bind to sulfated GAGs is a product of natural selection and 
this  binding  plays  an  important  role  in  their'normal  biological  activity.  The 
nature of this role is still far from clear; however, a number of possibilities deserve 
further analysis  and experimental attention. 

Heparin  potentiates the  biological activity  of aFGF in  PC12 cells,  adrenal 
chromaffin  cells,  retinal  ganglion  cells,  and  ciliary  ganglion  (WAGNER  and 
D'AMORE  1986;  DAMON  et aL  1988;  CLAUDE  et aL  1988;  LIPTON  et aL  1988; 
UNSICKER  et aL  1987;  NEUFELD  et aL  1987).  This  potentiation  is  so  striking 
(lOO-fold) that in the absence of exogenous heparin only unphysiologically large 
concentrations of aFGF are effective in stimulating neural differentiation and/or 
survivaL Heparin is not the only sulfated GAG that can substantively potentiate 
aFGF;  for  example,  dermatan  sulfate  is  nearly  as  effective  as  heparin  in 
potentiating neurite extension by PC12 cells (DAMON et aL  1988).  Furthermore, 
the effect of heparin and heparin-like molecules appears to be specific for aFGFs, 
and a similar pattern of potentiation is  not observed with other peptide growth 
factors  (NGF and/or bFGF), suggesting that a specific interaction between the 
growth  factor  and  the  GAG  or  the  growth  factor,  the  GAG,  and  the  cell  is 
important for  potentiation (DAMON  et aL  1988). 

The effect of heparin-like molecules on the biological activity of aFGF is not 
unique to nerve cells, but appears to be a common feature of this growth factor's 
effect on many cell types.  Heparin strongly potentiates the activity of aFGF on 
endothelial cells and has been an essential component of effort to  use  aFGF to 
allow  their  long-term  cultivation  (THORNTON  et aL  1983;  GIMENEZ-GALLEGO 
et aL  1986).  Heparin  also  potentiates  the  mitogenic effect  of aFGF on several 
types of fibroblasts and bovine epithelial lens cells (RYBAK et aL  1988; LOBB et aL 
1986;  UHLRICH  et aL  1986). 

Heparin  and  related  sulfated  GAGs  can  modestly  (5-fold)  potentiate  the 
biological  activity  of bFGF on  PC12  cells  (DAMON  et aL  1988).  The  ability  of 

The  Fibroblast Growth Factors 

107 

various sulfated GAGs to potentiate bFGF is not correlated with the potency of 
the sulfated GAGs to potentiate aFGF, again suggesting that there are specific 
interactions  between  the  GAG  and  the  growth  factor  that  result  in  the 
modification  of  biological  activity.  Heparan  sulfate  which  is  closely  related 
structurally to  heparin is  capable of strong inhibiting (100-fold)  the  biological 
activity bFGF (DAMON et al.  1988). Thus the interaction between sulfated GAGs 
and the FGFs have the capacity either to inhibit or to potentiate the biological 
activity  of the  growth factors.  Likewise,  heparin  has  been  used  to  inhibit  the 
natural induction of mesoderm in tissues derived from Xenopus embryos (SLACK 
et al.  1987), an observation that has been interpreted to suggest that heparin or 
heparin-like molecules may be  able to modify  the biological potency of FGFs, 
possibly by sequesting the FGF into a bound and inactive form.  Pretreatment of 
substrates with  heparin appears to potentiate the ability of bFGF to  stimulate 
neurite  outgrowth  from  hippocampal  neurons  (WALICKE  et al.  1986),  and  the 
ability of various  GAGs  to potentiate FGF activity is  directly correlated with 
their ability to  bind  bFGF to GAG-coated plates (WALICKE  1988b). 

As sulfated GAGs seem to have the ability both to potentiate and to inhibit 
the  biological  activities  of  the  FGFs,  the  explanation  for  these  important 
phenomena will undoubtedly be complex. Certainly sequestration of FGFs into 
an inactive or unavailable form by binding to GAGs is  an important part of any 
proposed mechanisms, but it is difficulte to see how this type of mechanism might 
explain potentiation. Potentiation is more likely to be explained by the ability of 
GAGs to  bind to the  FGF and either protect the FGF from  inactivation (e.g., 
proteolytic degradation) or stabilize it in a more active conformation. It has been 
known for some time that heparin can protect bFGF and aFGF from proteolytic 
inactivation (GOSPODAROWICZ  and  CHENG  1986).  This  work  suggests  that  the 
binding of GAGs to FGFs modifies their tertiary structure into one that is less 
accessible to proteases; however, such data cannot be extrapolated to explain the 
biological effects  of heparin on growth factor  activity without caution.  Recent 
work (DAMON et al.  1989) has clearly demonstrated that one of the key ways that 
heparin potentiates the biological activity of aFGF is by extending its biological 
half-life.  This  hypothesis  was  supported  by  the  observation  that  a  specific 
protease inhibitor (aprotinin)  could potentiate the  biological  activity  of aFGF 
and that heparin  potentiation  could  not  be  observed  under  conditions  where 
aFGF was re-added frequently to the media (DAMON et al.  1989). It is interesting 
to  speculate  that  the existence  of several  members  of the  FGF family  may  be 
partially  due  to  the  need  to  have  specific  mechanisms  for  inactivating  these 
growth  factors  under  different  circumstances.  For  example,  thrombin  can 
specifically  inactivate  aFGF  but  not  bFGF  (LOBB  1988).  It  has  also  been 
suggested  that  protection  from  proteolytic  inactivation  may  explain  heparin 
potentiation of aFGF dependent mitogenicity on endothelial cells (ROSENGART 
et al.  1988). 

Thus, heparin and related GAGs may modulate the biological activity of the 
FGF  family  by  a  number  of  distinct  mechanisms.  The  simplest  of  these 
mechanisms would include the ability of FG F to bind to these molecules and be 

108 

J. A.  Wagner 

sequestered or protected from proteolytic inactivation; however, more complex 
mechanisms cannot be ruled out at present. For example, a dual recognition of 
FGF and associated heparin by a complex cell surface receptor might result in a 
stronger activation of cell's surface receptors, or the change in the structure of the 
FG F peptide might modify the type of cell surface receptor that is recognized. The 
most intriguing question that needs to be answered is the biological role served by 
the association of the FG Fs with heparin. Is this purely a means of extending their 
biological activity or is it potentially a method of restricting the availability of 
these  biologically  potent  trophic  molecules  to  a  local  area?  bFGF  has  been 
shown to bind to the heparan sulfate that is present in the basement membrane 
(VLODAVSKY  et al.  1987;  BAIRD  and  LING  1987;  JEANNY  et al.  1987;  FOLKMAN 
et al. 1988; VIGINyet al.  1988), and endothelial cells have been shown to produce 
a  heparan  sulfate  proteoglycan that could  bind to  bFGF and protect it from 
proteases (SAKSELA et al. 1988). BAIRD et al. (1988) have used synthetic peptides to 
explore the regions of the bFGF peptide that are required for interaction with 
heparin and binding to the biological receptor. It is reasonable to speculate that 
the  FGFs  may  be  stored  in  the  basement membrane  where  they  could  be 
protected from extracellular proteases or presented to cells in the context of the 
basement  membrane.  Might  the  FGFs  be  available  to  cells  only  in  certain 
circumstances (e.g., during degradation of the extracellular matrix) and thus be 
present in  the  body  but unavailable to cells  because  of their  unique location? 
Could bound FGF be serving as a speCific marker to stimulate the extension of 
neuronal  processes  or  migration  of cells  along  specific  pathways?  These  are 
questions  that  are  truly  unique  to  the  FGFs  and  their  answers  will  almost 
certainly provide a profound insight into the mechanisms used by organisms to 
control morphogenesis, differentiation, and repair of nerves as well as other cell 
types. 

8  Mechanism of Action of the  FGFs 

The study of the way FGF interacts with its receptor and how occupation of this 
receptor may regulate nerve survival, neurite extension, or the myriad of other 
responses induced by FGF is, as might be expected, in its infancy, but the work 
that has  been  done  has  begun  to  give  us  an  insight  into  FGF-regulated  cell 
behavior. Before reviewing the literature in this field, consideration of some ofthe 
problems  that  will  confront  us  in  understanding  the  FGF  receptor  and  the 
biochemical mechanism of action of FGF will  be beneficial. 

First, as we have already noted, the FGFs are a gene family and there may be a 
heterogeneity within the  products of a  single  gene because of modifications  in 
proteolytic  processing  (KLAGSBRUN  et al.  1987)  and/or  mRNA  splicing.  This 
immediately suggests the possibility that multiple receptors may exist and that 
these  receptors  may  recognize  different  members  of the  family  with  different 
affinities.  A precedent for  this type of complexity clearly exists in other peptide 

The Fibroblast Growth Factors 

109 

hormones, such as insulin and the insulin-like growth factors or PDGF (HELDIN 
et al.  1988). Thus, the assignment of a particular receptor to a particular member 
of the FGF family should be done with caution. This assignment of a particular 
FGF  to  any  particular  physiological  process  must  require  evidence  from  a 
number of distinct areas, including not only the ability of a particular member of 
the family to regulate the response being studied, but also evidence that the family 
member  is  present  in  the  appropriate  tissue  and  secreted  or  released  at  the 
appropriate  time  for  the  cell  to  respond.  Thus,  particular  attention  to  dose(cid:173)
response curves, binding curves, in situ localization studies, and, eventually, the 
analysis  of mutants may  prove  to  be  important in this field. 

Second, it  is  not at all  clear that different  classes  of differentiated  cells  will 
share the same receptors or that the same receptor will be expressed on any cell 
type at all  times  in development.  Third,  the fact  that  FGFs all  bind tightly  to 
GAGs introduces a problem that is unique to the study of FGFs. It is important 
to guard against potential artifacts  resulting from  the binding of the  FGFs to 
endogenous GAGs. On the other hand, it is completely possible that associaton 
of the  FGFs with endogenous GAGs may  be  important, or even essential,  for 
receptor function.  A dual recognition of the FGF molecule (by  both a classical 
receptor  and  a  cell  surface  sugar)  may  have  a  number  of  important  effects 
including modulating the effect of the FGF on its receptor, prolonging the half(cid:173)
life of the growth factor-receptor complex, modulating the efficacy of the FGF, 
etc.  Finally, it is important to ascertain whether binding of the FGFs to GAGs 
that  are  present  in  the  extracellular  matrix  have  a  biologically  important 
function. Such binding may: (1) stabilize the FGF to proteases or other enzymes, 
(2) present the growth factor to appropriate cells while precluding its recognition 
by  inappropriate  cells,  or  (3)  result  in  the  exposure  of  active  FGF  during 
physiological processes of matrix degradation. The number of models in which 
various GAGs might be involved in the action ofFGF is really limited only by the 
imagination ofthe individual investigator, as the amount of data that really bears 
on  this  issue  is  still  quite  small;  however,  the  retention  of specific  binding  to 
heparin  and  other  sulfated  sugars  through  evolution  clearly  points  to  an 
important role for this interaction and an explanation certainly must be obtained 
before  we  can  claim  to  understand  how  the  FGFs  regulate  cell  division, 
differentiation,  and determination. 

The  FGF  receptor  has  been  investigated  in  a  number  of cell  types  using 
equilibrium  binding and cross-linking studies,  and there  appears  to  be  both  a 
high  affinity  Kd =  10 - 11  M)  and a  low  affinity  (Kd =  10 - 9  M)  receptor.  Cross(cid:173)
linking studies have identified a  receptor with a molecular mass in the range of 
125-170 kDa  depending  on  the  particular  cell  type  that  was  studied.  FGF 
receptors have been identified in endothelial cells, muscle cells, fibroblasts, PC12 
cells, hepatoma lines, epithelial cell lines, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, and 
primary cultures from  several regions of the brain that are enriched in neurons 
(NEUFELD  and GOSPODAROWICZ  1988;  MOSCATELLI  1987,  1988;  FARIEFEL  1986, 
endothelial cells; OLWIN and HAUSCHKA  1986, muscle; COURTY et al.  1988, brain; 
NEUFELD et al.  1987, PC12 cells; MOENNER et al.  1986, bovine lens epithelial cells; 

110 

1.  A.  Wagner 

KAN  et al.  1988,  hepatoma;  NEUFELD  and  GOSPODAROWICZ  1985,  BHK  cells; 
andW ALICKE  et al.  1989, brain). In addition to the high  molecular weight  FGF 
receptor, neuron enriched cultures from  the brain contained an 85 kDa binding 
protein.  The  apparent  affinity  of  the  FGF  receptor  in  these  cultures  is 
significantly  lower  than  that  found  in  other  cell  types  (WALICKE  et al.  1989), 
supporting the possibility that the form  of the FGF receptor found in the brain 
may be distinct from  the form  found  in mesenchymal cells. The demonstration 
that several  classes  of neural  cells  and membranes  that are  prepared from  the 
brain  have  high  affinity  receptors  for  FGF  supports  the  assertion  that  these 
peptides are indeed neural growth factors. 

MOSCATELLI (1987) demonstrated that the high affinity binding site for bFGF 
was acid sensitive and seemed to be associated with the biological receptor whose 
occupation  led  to  cell  division  and  plasminogen  activator  production  in 
endothelial cells.  The low  affinity  site was  salt sensitive and appeared to  be  an 
association of the growth factor  with  heparin-like molecules  on the cell.  BHK 
cells are a useful experimental system for the study of FGF because they have an 
unusually  high  number  of receptors  (1.2  x  105 )  per  cell  and  a  strikingly  low 
concentration oflow affinity binding sites that appear to be saturable (NEUFELD 
and GOSPODAROWICZ  1985). The effect of heparin on binding to the high affinity 
receptor  is  complex.  MOSCATELLI  (1988)  has  reported  that  heparin  competes 
strongly for binding ofbFGF to low affinity sites but does not compete strongly 
for  binding  to  the  high  affinity  sites.  NEUFELD  and  GOSPODAROWICZ  (1986), 
however, have reported that heparin strongly inhibits cross-linking ofFGF to the 
high affinity receptor in BHK and PC12 cells, while heparin did not inhibit the 
cross-linking  of aFGF  to  its  receptor.  Nevertheless,  aFGF  and  bFGF  were 
reported to compete for the same receptor. SCHREIBER et al. (1985) have suggested 
that heparin actually increases the affinity of aFG F for its receptor in endothelial 
cells. There is no obvious explanation for these apparently conflicting sets of data, 
but as  a  more detailed biochemistry of the receptor(s)  becomes  available  these 
observations  should  be  clarified.  After  exposure  to  aFGF  or bFGF, the  FGF 
receptor is internalized resulting in a population of occupied receptors in which 
FGF is  no  longer available  at the  cell  surface.  In some  cases  the  FGF that is 
internalized  appears  to  be  degraded  (FRIESEL  and  MACIAG  1988;  MOSCATELLI 
1988). 

The FGF receptor has been characterized in a number of other biochemical 
ways. In BHK cells, it is  a glycoprotein with a core protein of between  100 and 
125 kDa that is  glycosylated to a  high mannose form  of 115-140 kDa which is 
processed to a mature species  of 130-150 kDa. It binds strongly to wheat germ 
agglutinin, which inhibits the binding of FG F to the receptor. Furthermore, the 
core glycoprotein is  unable to recognize and bind the FGFs suggesting that the 
N -acylglucosamine  residues  are  functionally  significant  components  of  the 
receptor (FEIGE and BAIRD  1988). aFGF also stimulates the phosphorylation of a 
135 kDa protein on tyrosine residues, and this protein can be cross-linked to the 
growth  factor  suggesting  either  that  the  FGF  receptor  is  itself,  or  is  tightly 
associated with, a protein tyrosine kinase (HUANG and HUANG  1986; COUGHLIN 

The Fibroblast Growth Factors 

III 

et al.  1988). The FGF receptor has been purified using affinity chromatography 
on both wheat germ agglutinin and bFGF affinity columns. The purified receptor 
consisted of two species, one with a molecular mass of 110 kDa and a second with 
a molecular mass around 140kDa although the latter appeared to be by far the 
predominant species eluted at higher concentrations of heparin (IMAMURA et al. 
1988).  Both  aFGF  and  bFGF  have  been  shown  to  interact  with  two  FGF 
receptors,  but on the basis of competition studies it appears that aFGF binds 
preferentially  to  the  125 kDa  species,  while  bFGF  binds  preferentially  to  the 
145 kDa species (NEUFELD  and GOSPODAROWICZ  1986). 

The second messenger systems that are regulated by the occupation of the 
FGF  receptor(s)  have  not  yet  been  completely  defined,  but  accumulating 
evidence  suggests  the  possible  involvement  of several  of the  classical  second 
messenger  pathways.  As  noted  above,  the  FGF receptor  is  associated  with  a 
tyrosine kinase (HUANG and HUANG  1986; COUGHLIN et al. 1988). Occupation of 
the FGF receptor leads to phosphoinositide turnover and activation of protein 
kinase C (TSUDA et al.  1985; KAffiucm et al.  1986; MOSCATELLI  1988), although 
there is also evidence that this second messenger system is not essential for FGF 
action in some cases (MAGNALDO  et al.  1986).  aFGF has also been reported to 
activate adenylate cyclase in smooth muscle cells (MIOH and CHEN  1987), lead to 
activation of the S6 kinase (PELECH et al.  1986), and regulate ion flux (HALPERIN 
and LOBB  1987).  BOUCHE  et al.  (1987)  reported that FGF is  translocated to the 
nucleolus  and  that exogenous  FGF  added  to  isolated  nucleoli  can  stimulate 
rRNA transcription, although it is unclear if they were studying a specific effect of 
the growth factor.  In PC12 cells and in fibroblasts,  FGF rapidly regulates gene 
expression  (GREENBERG  et al.  1985;  CHO  et al.  1989;  LEONARD  et al.  1987; 
KAmucm et al.  1986), but the pathways responsible for this effect  have not yet 
been established. In PC12 cells, the protein kinase inhibitor k-252a can block the 
biological  responses  to  NGF  but  not  FGF.  Thus,  K-252a  could  be  a  useful 
pharmacological  agent  in  mechanistic and  physiological  studies  of these  two 
growth factors (KOIZUMI et al. 1988; CHo et al. 1989; HAsmMoTo 1988). Given the 
pleiotropic response induced  by the FGFs, the  signaling pathway used  by the 
FGFs would be expected to be complex.  Moreover, because of the diversity of 
responsive cells, there may be variations in the second messenger systems used by 
different classes of differentiated cell types.  It is  also  reasonable to expect that 
there may be an interaction among the signal transduction systems regulated by 
the FGFs and other neurotrophicfactors, like NGF. A physiological understand(cid:173)
ing of the role of the  FGFs will  require an understanding of this  relationship. 

9  The  Growing Puzzle of the  FGFs: 

More Questions than  Answers 

In contrast to NGF which has been studied for 50 years, the effects of the FGFs 
on neural cells  have  become  apparent  only in  the  last  few  years;  yet,  because 
of modem methods and the current appreciation of the ways one might expect

a neural growth factor  to work, the rate of progress has been remarkable. The 
work reviewed above has provided the fundamental information that is needed 
to  phrase  the  really  significant  questions.  The  study  of the  role  of the  FGF 
family in neural development promises to be one of great importance and great 
complexity.  There  is  persuasive  evidence  that  members  of  this  family  can 
stimulate neurite formation,  promote cell survival, and regulate differentiation 
in specific classes of nerve cells; however, there are at least five  major members 
of the  FGF family,  and members  of this  family  affect  a  diverse  set  of neural 
and non-neural cells. Does this reflect some underlying coordination of develop(cid:173)
mental  processes,  or is  it  the  use  of the  same  signalling  molecule  in  different 
circumstances for different purposes, much as the same set of neurotransmitters 
are used for many different functions? For example, could the FGFs be involved 
in coordinating vascularization and innervation during development or wound 
healing? Are there a family ofFGF receptors that preferentially recognize specific 
members of the FGF family, or are there specific FGF receptors that are linked 
to  specific  second  messenger  systems?  Why  has  the  ability  to  bind  to  GAGs 
been conserved in this family,  and  which  of the  GAGs found  in  the  organism 
are important for the regulation ofFGF activity? What cells produce the FGFs? 
How are the FGFs stored? How is  the release of aFGF and bFGF which lack 
the classic leader sequence  regulated? Is  release of aFGF and bFGF after cell 
lysis a biologically important pathway or is  there another way these molecules 
are  released?  What cells  respond  to  the  FGFs during development?  How  are 
the expression of the FGFs regulated? What are the roles of the FGFs that are 
preferentially  expressed  during  embryogenesis?  What  classes  of  nerve  cells 
respond to the FGFs? Do the FGFs regulate cell survival or stimulate neurite 
outgrowth in  vivo?  Are  some  cells  transiently  responsive  to  particular FGFs? 
Would the failure ofthe FGF dependent pathways lead to degenerative diseases 
of the  nervous  system  or other pathological conditions? Does the  presence  of 
heparan  sulfate. proteoglycans  in  the  amyloid  structures  that  develop  in 
Alzheimer's disease implicate the FGFs in the development of this disease? Could 
therapies using the FGFs or pharmacological agents that act on FGF dependent 
signaling pathways result in the stimulation of regeneration or prevent neurode(cid:173)
generation in the PNS or CNS in a clinically significant way?  Answering these 
and  related  questions  will  certainly  provide  a  fruitful  opportunity  for  many 
neuroscientists to substantively increase our appreciation of how a functioning 
nervous system .is  formed,  maintained, and repaired in the organism.

1  Introduction 

The neuronal growth factors nerve growth-factor (NGF) and fibroblast growth 
factor (FGF) play important roles in the development of both the peripheral and 
central nervous systems. These agents are survival factors in vivo and in neuronal 
cell  culture.  They  appear to promote  the  differentiation  of different  classes  of 
neurons  and  may  also  play  some  part  in  the  guidance  of neuronal  process 
outgrowth. It is apparent that neuronal growth factors, as exemplified by NGF 
and FGF, encompass an enormous range of actions, making elucidation of the 
underlying molecular mechanisms a formidable task. However, a multidiscipli(cid:173)
nary approach has been brought to bear on this task, and studies of neuronal

growth factor action have gained from  as well  as  contributed insights to  other 
fields. 

Most of our present understanding of the mechanisms underlying NGF and 
FGF  actions  comes  from  cell  culture  studies  where  the  environment  can  be 
tightly  controlled.  Two  types  of culture  systems  have  predominated  in  these 
studies,  primary  neuronal  cell  culture  and  transformed  cell  lines.  Primary 
cultures have provided a rich description of the phenotypic changes that occur in 
response  to  neuronal  growth  factor  treatment.  This  culture  system  is  also 
particulary well-suited to the study of neuronal growth factor effects on survival. 
Ironically, molecular studies of NGF and FGF action using primary neuronal 
cultures have been hampered by the very same property that made these cultures 
appealing in the first  place.  That is,  because primary cultures require NGF for 
survival, it is  difficult if not impossible to study the effects  on survival separate 
from  those involved in differentiation.  An  additional limitation of the  primary 
culture systems lies in their previous exposure to neuronal growth factors in vivo, 
thus eliminating the ability to study initial effects  of the growth factors  on the 
naive  cells.  The  establishment  of  the  pe12  clonal  cell  line  by  GREENE  and 
TISCHLER  in  1976  circumvented  these  problems  and  provided  an  alternative, 
manipulatable culture system  for  molecular studies  of NGF and  FGF action. 
With  these  cells,  neuronal  growth  factors  are  necessary  and  sufficient  for 
neuronal  differentiation,  but  the  undifferentiated  cells  grow  continuously  in 
culture in the absence of these factors. This latter property is particularly useful 
from the point of view of introducing foreign DNA into NGF responsive cells in 
order to manipulate the system in specific ways and to study the growth factor 
effects  on gene  expression. 

As  in  primary  cell  cultures,  the  changes  in  pe12  cell  physiology  after 
treatment with NGF and FGF are both dramatic and complex. Unraveling the 
puzzle of the mechanism of such changes has been a long and exciting, although 
at  times  perplexing,  endeavor involving  a  unique  signal  transduction  process. 
This chapter will focus  primarily on revelations from  studies of NGF and FGF 
actions  in  pel2 cells.  Events  apparently  underlying  neuronal  growth  factor 
actions  on  pe12  cells  will  be  extrapolated  where  appropriate  to  primary 
neuronal cultures  or in  vivo  systems. 

2  PC12 Cell Culture System 

The pel2 cell  line,  originally derived from  a  spontaneous  rat pheochromocy(cid:173)
toma (GREENE  and TISCHLER  1976),  displays  basic phenotypic traits  associated 
with  both adrenal chromaffin  cell  and  sympathetic neuron characteristics (for 
review  see  GREENE  and  TISCHLER  1982).  In  the  following  sections,  we  will 
concentrate on the properties of pe12 cells  pertinent to  their use  in  studies  of 
NGF and  FGF action. 

Dissecting the Mode of Action of a Neuronal Growth Factor 

121 

In the absence ofNGF or FGF, PC12 cells grow indefinitely in cell culture. 
When  treated  with  NGF,  PC12  cells  undergo  a  dramatic  transformation 
strikingly along the lines  of differentiating sympathetic neurons.  For example, 
PC12 cells undergo morphologic differentiation involving the formation of long 
neuronal  processes  (neurites)  resembling  axons,  including  the  presence  of 
prototypic growth cones.  The neurites  appear after at least a  2 day delay and 
elongate in the continual presence of NGF. Concurrent with the formation  of 
neurites,  PC12  cells  acquire  the  ability  to  generate  sodium  based  action 
potentials. In addition to sodium channels, a variety of other voltage dependent 
ion  channels  appear  at  the  neuritic  growth  cone.  Neurotransmitter synthesis 
increases after NGF treatment as evidenced by increases in the amounts of both 
catecholamines  and  acetylcholine,  and  these  can  be  realeased  in  a  vesicular 
fashion  at the  neuritic growth cone. 

Most  studies  of  the  differentiation  of  PC12  cells  have  involved  NGF. 
However,  it has  been  suggested  recently  that  FGF is-also  a  neuronal growth 
factor for CNS neurons and can affect differentiation in the adrenosympathetic 
lineage  (see  WAGNER,  this  volume).  Surprisingly,  FGF also  induces  neuronal 
differentiation of PC12 cells,  and this induction is  in many  respects  similar to 
the  differentiation  by  NGF.  Importantly,  not  all  growth  factors  cause  the 
differentiation of PC12 cells. The inability of some growth factors (e.g. epidermal 
growth factor, EGF; insulin) to cause differentiation of PC12 cells can be used to 
advantage  to  identify  those  molecular  events  which  are  critical  to  achieving 
neuronal  differentiation.  Therefore,  the  effects  of NGF  and  FGF  have  been 
compared to "non-differentiating" growth factors. 

3  Signal Transduction 

Differentiation induced by growth factors  involves dramatic changes in major 
cellular processes. These changes are evident from as early as seconds to as long(cid:173)
as days in the continual presence of the growth factor. Evidence has accumulated, 
as will be discussed below, for a model of growth factor action in which a variety 
of cellular control mechanisms are coordinately recruited to bear on the process 
of differentiation induced by  NGF (Fig.  I).  The binding of a  neuronal growth 
factor  to  its  receptor  results  in  the  stimulation  of multiple  second  messenger 
pathways.  Stimulation  of these  pathways causes  a  series  of post-translational 
modificatiQns of specific proteins, which lead to immediate changes in the cellular 
phenotype. Substrates for post-translational modification include DNA binding 
proteins  which,  when  modified,  elicit  specific  gene  expression  changes.  The 
changes in gene expression have  been compared to changes _that  occur during 
viral infection of cells. They are initially seen as a transient wave of very early gene 
inductions  which  have  been  termed  "immediate  early  genes"  and  which,  for

Dissecting the Mode of Action of a  Neuronal Growth Factor 

123 

mitogenic growth factor actions, have also been termed "primary response genes" 
(yAMAMOTO  and ALBERTS  1976;  LIM et al.  1987).  The protein products of these 
genes have been generally found  to be transcriptional trans-activators which in 
various combinations result in the control of the expression of a variety of genes, 
including  their  own.  The initial induction  of primary response  genes  leads  to 
subsequent waves of gene inductions and repressions, which result in changes in 
the levels of proteins important to the differentiated phenotype. Other changes in 
gene expression caused by initial post-translational events include those resulting 
from changes in mRNA stability and/or translation. The ongoing combination of 
transcriptional,  post-transcriptional,  and  post-translational  events  coordinate 
the  differentiation  process  under  the  reversible  and  continual  control  of the 
neuronal growth factor. 

3.1  NGF or  NGF-Receptor as an  Intracellular Effector 

In  some  way,  the  binding  of  NGF  to  its  receptor  is  transduced  into  an 
intracellular response encompassing a sequence of complex changes in the cell 
over a long time span. The question of whether NGF acts more directly to elicit 
these changes, such as through the internalization of the NGF-receptor complex, 
or acts indirectly through the generation of second messengers has been labored 
over for almost 20 years. It is certainly clear that both events occur; the NGF(cid:173)
receptor complex is internalized and various second messengers are generated in 
response  to NGF treatment.  However,  the  mechanism  by  which  these  events 
occur and  the  specific  changes  in cellular  physiology  brought about by  these 
events have only begun to be dissected. 

In 1974,  HENDRY et al.  provided evidence that NGF is  taken up at sensory 
nerve terminals and retrogradely transported to the cell  body.  Recent findings 
have verified this result in vivo (JOHNSON et al. 1987). CAMPENOT (1977) has shown 
that NGF can act at nerve  terminals to promote survival of the neuronal cell 
body in culture. These results have been taken to imply that NGF itself has an 
intracellular site of action. It is  clear that NGF binds to cell  surface  receptors 
followed by vesicular internalization of the NGF-receptor complex. There have 
been two schools of thought as to the fate and role of this complex. In one view, 
the complex is internalized and transported toward the cell body. The complex 
may  then  be  degraded  in  the  lysosomes  or  the  complex  may  be  dissociated, 
followed  by  recycling  of these  components  back  to  the  cell  surface.  Ample 
evidence exists for both of these processes (see CHAO this volume) but, in this view, 
NGF-receptor complexes do not exert physiological effects after they are inter(cid:173)
nalized. In the second view, either NGF or the NGF-receptor complex is trans(cid:173)
ported to sites in the cell body where it may exert important biological actions. 

IfNGF has an intracellular site of action, it is likely to be in a complex with its 
membrane  receptor,  since  injection  of either free  NGF or antibodies  directed 
against NGF into PC12 cells does not have any apparent effects on NGF action. 
One possible site of NGF-receptor action which has received much attention is 

124 

S.  Halegoua, R. C.  Armstrong, and N. E.  Kremer 

the nucleus. This site has been appealing since it could explain NGF's ability to 
elicit  transcriptional  contro1.  Two  types  of studies  have  lent  support  to  this 
hypothesis. In the first, BRADSHAW and colleagues (ANDRES et al. 1977) presented 
evidence for the existence of NGF receptors (in the form of 125I_NGF binding 
sites) in the nucleus and, more specifically, associated with chromatin. Y ANKNER 
and  SHOOTER  (1979)  subsequently  presented  evidence  that  the  NGF-receptor 
complex became associated with the nucleus after internalization. This was seen 
by following both 125I_NGF localization and NGF binding sites to the nuclear 
(Triton X-l00 insoluble) fraction. However, a convincing study by BOTHWELL and 
colleagues (BOTHWELL et a1. 1980) argued that these receptors were bound only to 
the  cytoskeleton  which  was  contaminating  Y ANKNER  and  SHOOTER'S  nuclear 
preparations. Thus, the data to date do not appear to support the notion ofNGF 
and/or its receptor having a  direct nuclear effect. 

A last possible action of the internalized NGF-receptor complex which has 
not yet been experimentally addressed is that of a second messenger generator. It 
must  be  kept  in  mind  that  the  internalized  complex  would  exist  in  an 
endocytosed,  membrane-bound  vesicle  whose  orientation  is  inside  out.  NGF 
would remain mostly bound to the receptor since it is trapped in the vesicle. This 
binding might then be continually transduced into a signal generated to the cell

Fig. 2.  A possible  process  for  internalization and  retrograde  transport of functional  NGF signal 
transduction machinery.  Illustrated is a  neurite terminal containing NGF (filled  triangles) and its 
receptor (transmembrane molecule with extracellular ligand binding site and cytoplaslnic region), as 
well as peripherally membrane-bound signal transducing molecules (represented as gears). Binding of 
NGF  to  receptor  results  in  a  conformational  change  in  receptor  such  that  it  engages  a  signal 
transducing molecule,  which  may  in  tum engage  another one  or more  signal  transducers.  Signal 
transduction results in the generation of various second messengers (represented as nuts and bolts) 
resulting from  the activation of one or more signal transducers. Upon binding of NGF, the NGF(cid:173)
receptor complex is  also  endocytosed.  The internalized  vesicle  containing NGF and the  receptor 
binding domain inside, together with the signal transducers (facing the cytoplasm), is  retrogradely 
transported to the cell body. During and after transport to the cell body, NGF binding to the receptor 
continues to  result  in  stimulation  of the signal  transduction machinery and thus in  the continual 
production of second messengers

interior (Fig. 2). In this way, NGF could exert influences similar to those from the 
cell  surface,  over the long distances  of its intracellular transport (i.e.,  from  the 
nerve terminal to the cell  body). The experiments involving microinjections  of 
NGF or anti-NGF mentioned above have not addressed this possibility because 
the  injected  proteins  would  not  be  expected  to  have  entered  the  vesicular 
compartment containing NGF, its receptor, and the NGF-receptor complex. 

3.2  Cyclic Adenosine  Monophosphate 

The search for second messengers of NGF action has resulted in reports on a 
variety  of  second  messenger  stimulations.  The  second  messenger  initially 
suggested to underline NGF action was cyclic adenosine 3'-5' monophosphate 
(cAMP). Cyclic AMP was shown to rise transiently following NGF treatment of 
PC12 cells (SCHUBERT and WmTLOCK 1977; SCHUBERTet al. 1978) and sympathe(cid:173)
tic  and  sensory  neurons  (NIKODUEVIC  et al.  1975;  NARUMI  and  FUJITA  1978; 
SKAPER  et al.  1979).  However,  other investigators  reported  no  such  increases 
(FRAZIER et al.  1973; HATANAKA et al.  1978;  LAKSHMANAN  1978). Derivatives of 
cAMP  have  also  been  reported  to  mimic  aspects  of NGF  action.  Increased 
choline  acetyltransferase  (SCHUBERT  et al.  1977)  and  ornithine  decarboxylase 
(HATANAKA et al. 1978) activities, increased cell-substratum adhesion (SCHUBERT 
et al.  1978),  specific  alterations  in  cell  surface  lectin  binding  properties  and 
stimulation of neurite outgrowth (SCHUBERT  et al.  1978),  stimulation of Ca + + 
effiux (SCHUBERT et al. 1978), and modulation of both protein synthesis (GARRELS 
and  SCHUBERT  1979)  and  protein  phosphorylation  (HALEGOUA  and  PATRICK 
1980; Yu et al. 1980; and see also below) all occur in response to cAMP treatment. 
T.hese  actions suggested  that differentiation by NGF was  in  part or in  whole 
carried out through cAMP and led to the proposal of a specific model of NGF 
action (SCHUBERT et al.  1978). The model suggests that NGF induces an increase 
in  the intracellular level  of cAMP, causing an increase in Ca + +  mobilization, 
which in turn produces a structural change in the cell membrane. This membrane 
alteration enhances cell-substratum adhesion and leads to neurite extension in 
PC12 cells. 

Several  groups  further  analyzed  and  compared  the  cAMP  and  NGF 
responses.  With  respect  to  neurite  outgrowth,  although  intracellular  cAMP 
elevation generated short-term neurites and potentiated the induction of neurites 
by NGF, neither continued extension of these processes nor their potentiation 
proceeded beyond 3 days. In contrast to NGF, cAMP-induced neurites were not 
dependent upon RNA synthesis,  and cAMP treatment was not able to induce 
"priming" of PC 12 cells to NGF-stimulated neurite regeneration (GUNNINGet al. 
1981; also see GREENE and SHOOTER 1980 for review). Analogues of cAMP which 
competitively  inhibit  cAMP-mediated  activation  of  the  cAMP  dependent 
protein kinase (A-kinase) were able to block cAMP actions on PC12 cells but not 
NGF-induced  neurite  outgrowth  (RICHTER-LANDSBERG  and  JASTORFF  1986). 
Analyses of gene expression changes stimulated by NGF have demonstrated that 

126 

S.  Halegoua, R.  C.  Armstrong, and N.  E.  Kremer 

some are not affected by cAMP alone (for example see 010 et al. 1989; LEONARD 
et al. 1987). These results have argued against the involvement of cAMP in NGF 
action.  However,  a  detailed  analysis  of tyrosine  hydroxylase  (TH)  and  other 
protein phosphorylations (see Sect. 3.4), indicate that NGF stimulates a subset of 
phosphorylations through the action of A-kinase. Taken together, the available 
data suggest that cAMP plays a  role in some but not all NGF actions and that 
cAMP may act in concert with other second messengers (see below) to carry out 
NGF action. In an accessory role, cAMP may not appear to be either necessary 
or sufficient for some NGF actions, for example, long-term neurite outgrowth or 
the activation of TH leading to enhanced catecholamine synthesis. That cAMP 
plays an essential role in at least one prominent NGF action is indicated by the 
finding  that  the  inhibitor  protein  of A-kinase  blocks  the  induction  of Na + 
channel activity and thus the development of an action potential mechanism in 
response to NGF (KALMAN  et al.  1990). 

3.3  Phospholipid Metabolism 

The turnover of phosphatidylinositol (PI) is another second messenger pathway 
suggested to playa role in NGF actions. In this pathway, the inositol lipids are 
broken down to liberate at least two second messengers, diacylglycerol which is 
an  activator  of protein  kinase  C  (C-kinase),  and  inositol  trisphosphate  (IP 3) 
which causes a rise of intracellular free Ca + +  liberated from intracellular stores 
(for review see ABDEL-LATIF 1986). LAKSHMANNAN (1979) first reported increased 
labeling of the phosphoinositides in rat superior cervical ganglion neurons after 
4 h of exposure to NGF. This finding was subsequently reproduced and extended 
in PC12 cells. 32P04labeling (TRAYNOR et al. 1982) or [3H]myoinositollabeling 
(TRAYNOR  1984) of each of the PIs (PI, PIP, PIP 2) in PC12 cells was specifically 
.  increased relative to that of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine 
within 10min of NGF treatment, a  finding  which is indicative of increased  PI 
turnover. Similar effects were seen with other agents that stimulated either cell(cid:173)
substrate adhesion or neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells including agents which 
raise cAMP (TRAYNOR  1984). These data were suggested to lend support to the 
model for NGF action proposed by SCHUBERT et al. (1978) discussed above. The 
model was thus extended to identify PI turnover as either the link between cAMP 
and  Ca + +  mobilization  or  as  a  step  subsequent  to  cAMP-mediated  Ca + + 
mobilization previously suggested to be caused by NGF. 

More  recently, 

investigators  have  examined  the  breakdown  of  the 
phosphoinositides  more  directly  by  examining  the  release  of  [3H]inositol 
phosphates  from  cultured  bovine  chromaffin  cells  (PANDIELLA-ALONSO  et al. 
1986) or from PC12 cells (CONTRERAS  and GUROFF  1987)  in which these lipids 
were  prelabeled.  In  both  studies,  NGF  increased  the  production  of labeled 
IP, IP2, and IP 3  after as little  as  15s (CONTRERAS  and GUROFF  1987) of treat(cid:173)
ment.  Studies  in  our  laboratory  (J.  CREMINS,  R.  ARMSTRONG,  J.  WmTBREAD, 
T. WmTFORD  and S.  HALEGOUA, in preparation) have addressed the question of 

Dissecting the  Mode of Action  of a  Neuronal Growth Factor 

127 

cAMP involvement in this NGF effect  on PC12 cells.  NGF, FGF, and cAMP 
were each found to stimulate increased specific 32P04labeling of PI, PIP, PIP 2, 
and phosphatidic acid. NGF-stimulated PI turnover was found to consist of two 
components,  a  minor  cAMP  dependent  component  and  a  major  cAMP 
independent one. The cAMP dependent PI turnover could be distinguished by its 
sensitivity  to  pertussis  toxin  and  its  requirement  for  A-kinase.  These  results 
provide further support for the suggestion that cAMP plays at least an accessory 
role in NGF action and helps to explain some of the differences between cAMP 
and NGF actions. 

Several studies have suggested a role for Ca + +  in the PI turnover response to 
NGF.  NGF-stimulated  PI  turnover  was  dependent  upon  extracellular  Ca + + 
(PANDIELLA-ALONSO et al. 1986; CONTRERAS and GUROFF 1987), and an increased 
influx  of extracellular Ca + +  also  elicited  PI turnover in  PC12 cells  (TRAYNOR 
1984; CONTRERAS  and GUROFF  1987).  PANDIELLA-ALONSO  et al.  (1986)  reported 
that NGF rapidly (within 30 s) caused a rise in intracellular Ca +  +  in both PCl2 
cells and cultured adrenal chromaffin cells, as  seen using the fluorescent  Ca + + 
indicators quin-2 (on a population of cells) and fura-2 (at the single cell level). The 
Ca +  +  mobilizing effect ofNGF was unusual as compared to depolarizing agents 
or neurotransmitters in that it was small, had a slow rise time, and a delayed onset 
(30-40 s) after NGF addition (see also LAZAROVICI et al.  1989). NG F -stimulated 
Ca + +  mobilization  was  also  dependent  upon extracellular Ca + +,  however,  it 
could  proceed  if Ca + +  was  removed  during  the  lag  phase and beyond.  From 
these  and  other  results,  the  authors  suggested  that  NGF-induced  changes  in 
Ca + +  consist of two phases, one which involves an influx of extracellular Ca + + 
through channels other than the voltage dependent Ca +  +  channel and the other 
which involves IP 3-mediated Ca +  +  release from intracellular stores. Long-term 
Li +  treatment of cells interferes with PI turnover in a variety of cell types.  Such 
treatment  reversibly  blocks  NGF-induced  neurite  outgrowth  and  NGF(cid:173)
stimulated microtubule protein phosphorylation (BURSTEIN et al. 1985). Interest(cid:173)
ingly,  the  Li +  block  of neurite  growth  could  be  reversed  by  depolarization(cid:173)
mediated Ca + +  entry (S.  HALEGOUA,  unpublished work). The potential involve(cid:173)
ment of PI turnover and/or Ca +  +  in the blocking action of Li +  remains to  be 
determined. 

One result ofthe breakdown of the PI lipids is the liberation of diacylglycerol 
consisting  predominantly  of  1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoylglycerol,  which  is  then 
rapidly  converted  to  phosphatidic  acid.  However,  when  the  production  of 
diacylglycerol from  [3H]myristate or from  [3H]arachidonate labeled cells  was 
examined,  NGF-induced  production  of  [3H]myristate  labeled  diacylglycerol 
was  more easily seen (CHAN  et al.  1989).  This result suggested that NGF could 
stimulate the breakdown of phospholipids other than PI. In the same study, the 
turnover  of  glycosylphosphatidylinositol  was  examined  in  eH]glucosamine 
labeled  cells.  Increased  turnover of this lipid  as  well  as  production  of inositol 
glycan was detected in response to NGF. However, the relative proportion of the 
total NGF-stimulated diacylglycerol derived from this lipid was not determined. 
This  result  led  to  the  suggestion  that  some  NGF  actions  may  be  mediated 

128 

S.  HaJegoua,  R. C.  Armstrong, and N. E.  Kremer 

through the breakdown of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (as suggested for other 
hormone  effectors,  see  SALTIEL  and  CuATRECASAS  1988)  with  the  resulting 
production of diacylglycerol followed  by C-kinase activation. 

An alternate mode of phospholipid metabolism which is exploited by the cell 
to generate a different range of second messengers is stimulation of phospholipase 
A2. The resulting release of arachidonic acid from some phospholipids is followed 
by  this  fatty  acid's  metabolism  to various  derivatives.  The ability  of NGF to 
stimulate  arachidonic  acid  metabolism  in  PC12  cells  was  examined  by 
DEGEORGEet al. (1988). It was found that NGF could stimulate the production of 
a variety of arachidonic acid derivatives either in homogenates or in cell culture, 
within as little as 5 min of treatment. Inhibitors of phospholipase A2 as well as of 
the lipoxygenase pathway for arachidonic acid metabolism were able to block 
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Inhibitors ofthe cyc100xygenase pathway for 
arachidonate  metabolism  had  no  such  effect.  Although  the  use  of  such 
pharmacological agents in long-term culture must be viewed with caution, the 
results  suggest  that  the  lipoxygenase  pathway  of lipid  metabolism  may  be 
required for the mediation of neurite growth by NGF. Clearly further studies are 
warranted to elucidate the potential involvement of the lipoxygenase pathway in 
NGF action. 

3.4  Protein Phosphorylation 

A post-translational event which seems to underlie nearly all  second messenger 
pathways is the phosphorylation of sp.ecific proteins. Resulting changes in these 
protein functions are a major means by which physiological changes are brought 
about. For the NGF system, studies of these processes have generally taken three 
approaches. One approach has focused on the identification of unknown proteins 
whose phosphorylation either in vivo or in cell extracts is  enhanced by in vivo 
NGF treatment.  Identification  of these  kinase  substrates  provides  a  basis  for 
subsequent studies  on determination of their roles  in  NGF action and on the 
identity of the protein kinase and second messenger system which controls the 
phosphorylation. A second approach has attempted to identify NGF-stimulated 
protein kinase activities assayed by using artificial or natural kinase substrates 
and measuring their phosphorylation, carried out in vitro or in situ. In a <third 
approach, known proteins already identified as, or suspected of, playing a role in 
NGF action have been further analyzed for possible phosphorylation by NGF(cid:173)
stimulated protein kinases. 

One study, using in vivo labeling of PC12 cells and of cultured sympathetic 
ganglia with 32P04, revealed increased labeling by up to 70% of a 30 kD nuclear 
protein  by  NGF  treatment  (Yu  et al.  1980).  This  protein  was  purified  and 
determined to be a  non-histone chromosomal protein, termed slow migrating 
protein (SMP). The protein phosphorylation, exclusively on serine residues, was 
seen also in response to EGF, TPA, dbcAMP, and FGF treatment (TOGARI et al. 
1985). These effects were subsequently reproduced in cell free  extracts of NGF 

Dissecting the Mode of Action of a  Neuronal Growth  Factor 

129 

treated  cells  (NAKANISID  and  GUROFF  1985).  The  kinase  responsible  for  this 
phosphorylation  was  determined  not  to  be  similar  to  C-kinase,  Ca + + / 
calmodulin dependent  protein  kinase  (CAMP kinase),  or A-kinase.  However, 
a cascade mechanism for SMP phosphorylation, involving A-kinase or C-kinase, 
remains a possibility. 

A series of studies from  our laboratory  has  examined  protein  phosphoryl(cid:173)
ations carried out within minutes after NGF treatment of PC12 cells. Increased 
32P04labeling of a variety of nuclear and non-nuclear proteins was first seen as 
five  radiolabeled  bands  by  one  dimensional  SDS-gel  electrophoretic  analysis 
(HALEGOUA  and  PATRICK  1980).  These  bands  were  identified  as  the  known 
proteins, TH, ribosomal protein S6, histones Hla and H3, and the non-histone 
chromosomal high mobility group protein HMG 17.  The turnover rate of the 
stimulated labeling was even higher than that of the basal labeling of these and 
many other proteins. This result implied that the increased protein phosphoryl(cid:173)
ation resulted from a stimulated kinase and that the NGF -stimulated phosphory(cid:173)
lations were  relatively susceptible to phosphatase action.  Stimulation of these 
protein phosphorylations was  both rapid  and prolonged, with  maximal  phos(cid:173)
phorylation occurring within 15 min and remaining elevated for at least 3 days 
during continuous NGF treatment ofthe cells. In an effort to identify the protein 
kinase  involved  in  this  NGF  effect,  phosphorylation  patterns  generated  by 
treatment with  NGF, EGF, insulin, and elevation of intracellular cAMP were 
compared. NGF and cAMP resulted in the same pattern of protein phosphoryl(cid:173)
ations, which  was different from  those of EGF and insulin.  Results from  these 
experiments as well as from additivity experiments using these agents to stimulate 
phosphorylation  of  ribosomal  protein  S6  led  to  the  suggestion  that  NGF 
stimulated the phosphorylation of the A-kinase. From this study and extrapolat(cid:173)
ing from work on other systems, it was suggested that some of these phosphoryl(cid:173)
ations played roles in known NGF actions such as increased protein synthesis 
(for  ribosomal  protein S6)  and changes in  DNA structure and transcriptional 
activation  (for  the  chromosomal  proteins).  A  new  action  of  NGF  was  also 
suggested,  rapidly  increased  catecholamine  synthesis  resulting from  the  phos(cid:173)
phorylation and activation of TH. 

The activation of TH by  NGF-stimulated phosphorylation was  suggested 
from the results of two independent groups. In one case, the activity of TH was 
found to be elevated in extracts of cells which had been treated with NGF, in a 
time course similar to that ofTH phosphorylation (LEE et al. 1985). A similar time 
course of TH activation was seen in PC12 cells in response to NGF (McTIGUE 
et al.  1985)  using  an  assay  for  TH  activity  which  measures  the  rate  of dopa 
accumulation in living cells.  Acute changes in TH activity have been seen both 
in vivo  and in vitro  in response  to  a  variety of agents  and culture conditions. 
These acute changes have in some cases been shown to be a direct consequence of 
phosphorylation  through  different  second  messenger  systems  (for  review  see 
ZIGMOND  et al.  1989).  In order to characterize  the  kinases  responsible  for  TH 
phosphorylation, its multisite phosphorylation in PC12 cells has been studied in 
detail using phosphopeptide mapping. Four distinct sites ofTH phosphorylation 

130 

S.  HaJegoua, R. C.  Armstrong, and N. E.  Kremer 

were observed (MCTIGUE et ai.  1985). Differential, site specific phosphorylation 
among these four sites was achieved by NGF, EGF, cAMP, depolarization, and 
phorbol esters,  indicating  that at least  four  kinases  could  phosphorylate  TH. 
Each of these  phosphorylations were  at single serine residues (McTIGUE  et al. 
1985;  J.  CREMINS  and  S.  HALEGOUA,  unpublished  work).  NGF stimulated  the 
phosphorylation of two peptides (Tl and T3), in common with those stimulated 
by cAMP (Tl  and T3) and phorbol esters (T3).  A subsequent study concluded 
that these two sites were phosphorylated in response to stimulation of A-kinase 
(Tl)  and  C-kinase  (T3)  (CREMINS  et ai.  1986),  because  NGF-stimulated  phos(cid:173)
phorylation ofTl was specifically blocked in an A-kinase deficient PC12 mutant 
(AI26-1B2) and that ofT3 was specifically blocked by drugs which also blocked 
both phorbol ester and dioctanoyl glycerol-mediated phosphyorylation of T3. It 
is  interesting  that  FGF  stimulated  the  phosphorylation  of only  site  T3  (D. 
DAMON, J. WAGNER, and S. HALEGOUA, unpublished work). The phosphorylation 
at site Tl is not stimulated in response to FGF, suggesting that the action ofFGF 
may  not involve  the  A-kinase.  A-kinase-mediated  phosphorylation  of site  T3 
(MCTIGUE  et ai.  1985)  is  believed  to  occur  by  indirect  activation  of C-kinase 
through a cAMP /pI turnover crosstalk pathway (discussed in Sect. 3.3), since this 
pathway is  specifically  blocked by pertussis toxin (J.  CREMINS  et aI.,  in prepar(cid:173)
ation).  TH is  an excellent substrate in vitro for  both the A-kinase and CAMP 
kinase II. The major sites of phosphorylation by these kinases are serine residues 
at position 40 and 19, respectively (ZIGMOND et ai.  1989). These sites correspond 
to those in phospho peptide Tl and T2 (see above), which are phosphorylated in 
response to cAMP and Ca + + elevations, respectively, in PC 12 cells (J. HAYCOCK, 
personal  communication).  Thus,  it  appears  likely  that  A-kinase  and  CAMP 
kinase II directly  phosphorylate Tl and T2 in vivo.  In contrast, TH is  poorly 
phosphorylated in vitro by C-kinase and the site of phosphorylation is the same 
as  that  of  A-kinase  (ALBERT.  et ai.  1984).  This  is  different  from  the  site 
phosphorylated in vivo in response to phorbol esters and diacylglycerol deriva(cid:173)
tives  (T3)  (see  above).  Thus it is  quite possible that C-kinase does  not directly 
phosphorylate TH in vivo,  but rather mediates its phosphorylation through a 
kinase cascade. The kinase capable of T3  phosphorylation in vitro has not yet 
been described. 

In an alternative approach for identifying NGF-stimulated protein kinases, 
TH was used as a substrate for phosphorylation in PC12 cell extracts (ROWLAND 
et al.  1987). Treatment of cells with NGF for as little as 1-3 min resulted in the 
stimulation  of a  kinase  activity  which  could  phosphorylate  serine  residues  of 
exogenously added TH in cell extracts. This soluble kinase activity, designated 
N-kinase, was partially purified and characterized, having an apparent molecular 
mass  of 22-25 kDa.  It could  also  phosphorylate  histQne  HI  and  ribosomal 
protein S6  in vitro.  N-kinase activity  stimulated by  NGF was  independent of 
cAMP and Ca + +, was resistant to inhibitors of C-kinase and calmodulin, and 
was  not  down  regulated  by  prolonged  phorbol  myristate  acetate  (PMA) 
treatment  (which  down  regulates  the  cellular  level  of its  receptor,  C-kinase). 
The N-kinase  was  thus  suggested  to  be distinct from  A-kinase,  C-kinase,  and 

Dissecting the  Mode of Action of a  Neuronal  Growth Factor 

131 

CAMP kinase.  However,  cAMP elevation,  Ca + +  elevation, and phorbol ester 
derivatives  can  all  result  in  N-kinase  activation  in  vivo,  suggesting  that  this 
kinase may be  activated in a  cascade manner.  N-kinase has been  suggested  to 
be  the  same  as  a  previously  described  S6  kinase  (BLENls  and  ERIKSON  1986) 
discussed below. Recently, N-kinase was found to be inhibited by 6-thioguanine 
(VOLONTE et al.  1989). The inability of these inhibitors to block NGF-stimulated 
TH phosphorylation in PC12 cells suggests that this kinase is not responsible for 
the TH phosphorylation seen in vivo. However, this major kinase activity is likely 
to have other as yet unidentified endogenous substrates which are important for 
mediating some NGF actions. This is indicated by, for example, the ability of 6-
thioguanine to inhibit both the induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and 
neurite regeneration from  PC12 cells  (VOLONTE  et al.  1989). 

Investigators in two laboratories have carried out similar in vitro studies to 
determine the kinases responsible for ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation in 
response  to  NGF.  In  one  set  of studies  (MATSUDA  et al.  1986;  MATSUDA  and 
GUROFF  1987),  PC12 cell extracts were assayed for kinase activity which could 
phosphorylate S6. S6 phosphorylation was found to be highly stimulated (10- to 
20-fold)  in  extracts  from  NGF treated  cells  relative  to  control  cells.  The  time 
course  of NGF stimulation of S6  kinase  was  similar  to  that seen  in  vivo  (see 
above), with complete activation seen within  15 min.  The kinase,  purified from 
PC12  cells,  has  a  molecular  mass  of  45 kDa  based  on  Sephadex  G200 
chromatography  and  is  specific  for  S6  phosphorylation.  It  is  sensitive  to 
inhibition by glycerophosphate and EGTA and by NaF, but is  not affected  by 
inhibitors  of  A-kinase,  C-kinase,  or  CAMP  kinase  II.  Based  on  the  above 
properties, it does  not appear to  be  related to any previously characterized S6 
kinase. That the kinase may be activated by phosphorylation is suggested by the 
shift  of the  kinase  toward a  more acidic  pI  concomitant with its activation by 
NGF. Alkaline phosphatase treatment restores both the original pI and activity 
level.Elevation of cAMP also  results  in  the  S6  kinase  activation  in  a  manner 
which is not additive with NGF, a result which is consistent with those obtained 
in  vivo  (see  above).  Since  A-kinase  can  activate  S6  kinase  by  in  vitro 
phosphorylation, it was suggested that NGF may activate S6  kinase through a 
kinase cascade involving the A-kinase. 

Another  investigation  has  revealed  an  S6  kinase  with  different  properties 
(BLENIS and ERIKSON 1986). While the NGF activation of S6 kinase activity seen 
by MATSUDA and GUROFF (1987) was transient (dropping to baseline within 2 h), 
this second S6 kinase activity was stimulated during at least  10 h of continuous 
NGF treatment.  Furthermore, the chromatographic properties  and  inhibition 
profiles  of the  two  activities  differed  markedly.  Ion exchange  chromatography 
showed two peaks of activity stimulated by NGF. The major peak of activity had 
the same elution profile as the S6 kinase from chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) 
cells. However, unlike the CEF kinase, it was not activated by treatment of cells 
with  orthovandate  or serum.  Total S6  kinase  activity  in  cell  extracts  was  also 
stimulated by  cAMP elevation,  PMA, EGF, and insulin.  None of these  agents 
were  additive  with  NGF in  the activation  of this  S6  kinase.  These  results  are 

132 

S.  Halegoua,  R.  C.  Armstrong, and  N.  E.  Kremer 

unlike those seen in vivo or in the above in vitro studies. PMA did not stimulate 
either S6  phosphorylation in vivo  or S6  kinase  activity  in  vitro.  Furthermore, 
among the same agents tested for additivity in stimulating S6 phosphorylation in 
vivo,  only NGF and  cAMP  were  not  additive.  The total  NGF stimulated  S6 
kinase activity seen in cell extracts in the present study was not inhibited by the 
A-kinase inhibitor protein added to the extracts but was partially inhibited by 
prolonged phorbol ester pretreatment of cells. The S6 kinase activities described 
by BLENIS and ERIKSON (1986) are clearly not the same as the S6 kinase described 
by MATSUDA  and GUROFF (1987). The former kinase activity is not inhibited by 
glycerophosphate and EGT A at levels  which completely inhibit  the  S6  kinase 
activity described by MATSUDA and GUROFF. The characteristics for activation of 
the S6 kinase of MATSUDA and GUROFF best match those described for the rapid 
stimulation ofS6 phosphorylation in PC12 cells (HALEGOUA and PATRICK  1980) 
and may well be the major kinase activity responsible for  this NGF stimulated 
phosphorylation in vivo. It is  possible that this S6 kinase activity predominates 
during an early phase (first 2 h) of S6 phosphorylation in response to NGF while 
the S6 kinase of BLENIS  and ERIKSON  is  dominant during a later phase (up to  3 
days) (HALEGOUA and PATRICK  1980). The involvement of S6 phosphorylation in 
the general increase in protein synthesis seen in response to NGF as well as  the 
role of different modes of S6 phosphorylation in controlling S6 function have not 
yet  been addressed. 

Several  other proteins phosphorylated in  response to NGF have also  been 
identified  by  in  vivo  labeling  with  32P04.  In  one  study  (GREENE  et al.  1983), 
increased labeling of several proteins was described in response to NGF. These 
included, in addition to TH, novel bands seen on SDS gels at apparent molecular 
masses  of 300 kDa,  72 kDa,  64 kDa,  and  56 kDa.  Increased  phosphorylation 
occurred over varying time periods, seen as early as 2 h and as late as 2 days and 
beyond.  FGF also  caused  an increase  in  the  labeling  of the  300 kDa  protein 
(RYDEL and GREENE 1987). The protein at 300 kDa was targeted for further study 
and was identified as a microtubule associated protein (MAP) designated MAP 
1.2. Subsequent studies indicated that this protein undergoes extensive regulation 
by  NGF  in  PC12  cells.  It is  rapidly  phosphorylated  within  15 min  of NGF 
treatment (ALETTA et al. 1988a). Levels ofthe protein (GREENE et al. 1983; DRUBIN 
et al.  1985; ALETTA et al.  1988a), its mRNA (LEWIS et al.  1986), and the protein's 
phosphorylation state (ALETTA  et al.  1988a) all increase over a period of several 
days.  MAP  1.2  protein  and  mRNA  levels  increase  about  three- to  fourfold, 
whereas the phosphorylation state increases up to about fourfold (ALETTA et al. 
1988a).  Other MAPs,  termed  chartins, are also  phosphorylated in  response  to 
NGF (BLACK et al. 1986). The phosphorylation state of the chartins changes over 
a 2 week  period of PC12 cell exposure to NGF such that the abundance of the 
acidic,  highly  phosphorylated  variants  increases  relative  to  the  basic,  less 
phosphorylated variants. It is  not clear whether these long-term changes in the 
phosphorylation state of MAPs are due to stimulated kinase activities, decreased 
phosphatase activities,  or the  relative accessibilities  of these substrates to such 
enzymes. A role for the changes of both phosphorylation and relative abundance 

Dissecting the  Mode of Action  of a  Neuronal Growth Factor 

133 

of  these  MAPs  in  microtubule  assembly  and  neurite  outgrowth  has  been 
repeatedly suggested and will  be discussed  further in Sect.  5. 

A novel neuronal intermediate fIlament protein, peripherin, has recently also 
been found to be phosphorylated in response to NGF. Peripherin is present in 
cells in multiple forms, a subset of which is phosphorylated (ALETTA et al.  1989). 
NGF-stimulated  phosphorylation  of  peripherin,  evident  in  electrophoretic 
analysis of extracts from 32pO 4  labeled cells, is seen by 1 h and peaks after 2 h of 
NGF  treatment.  Peripherin  is  also  phosphorylated  in  response  to  cAMP 
derivatives,  the  phorbol ester  12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA),  or 
depolarizing  levels  of K+,  but not in  response  to  EGF or insulin.  The  NGF(cid:173)
stimulated  phosphorylation of peripherin still  occurs  in  the A-kinase  deficient 
PC12 cell  variant (A126-IB2), indicating that A-kinase is  not necessary for  the 
major portion of this phosphorylation. The NGF-stimulated phosphorylation is 
seen also in PC12 cells which have been treated with high levels ofTPA to down 
regulate C-kinase activity and in cells treated with dihydropyridine blockers of 
voltage dependent Ca + +  channels. The authors suggested from these data that 
peripherin phosphorylation in  response  to  NGF did  not involve  A-kinase,  C(cid:173)
kinase,  or CAMP kinase.  However,  problems  with  C-kinase  down  regulation 
approaches (discussed below) suggest that such experiments may not rule out the 
mediation of phosphorylations by this family of kinases. Furthermore, nitrendi(cid:173)
pines block only a specific class of voltage dependent Ca + + channels and do not 
rule  out  the  involvement  of Ca + +  from  other plasma membrane  channels  or 
released from intracellular stores. The involvement of C-kinase or CAMP kinase 
in peripherin phosphorylation thus remains  an open question. 

NGF-induced  phosphorylation  of synapsin  I  was  examined  using  32P04 
labeled PC12 cells (ROMANO et al. 1987). Overall labelIng of synapsin I was found 
to  increase  by  about  one-third  within  30 min  of  treatment.  Phospho peptide 
mapping analysis indicated that the increased labeling occurred at one peptide 
designated  peptide N.  This  peptide was  distinct from  those  phosphorylated in 
vitro, using partially purified synapsin I, by any of four distinct protein kinases, 
A-kinase, CAMP kinases I and II, and C-kinase. On the basis of this result it was 
suggested  that  NGF  uses  a  distinct  kinase  to  carry  out  phosphorylation  of 
synapsin I. It is not known whether a cascade mechanism involving, for example, 
C-kinase  or  CAMP  kinase  mediates  this  phosphorylating  event  or  what 
relationships may exist between the in vitro phosphorylations and those carried 
out in  vivo.  However,  cAMP  elevation  in  PC12  cells  did  not  elicit  increased 
phosphorylation of synapsin I in spite of its phosphorylation by the A-kinase in 
vitro. 

In a novel approach to the identification of functionally important kinases 
stimulated  by  NGF, LANDRETH  and  RIESER  (1985)  examined  kinase  activities 
which  were  associated  with  the  PC12  cytoskeleton.  Detergent-insoluble  cell 
extracts were prepared in which the cytoskeleton (excluding microtubules) was 
well-preserved.  The  addition  of  [32PJATP  to  this  preparation  allowed  the 
labeling of a large number of proteins. The labeling of one protein of 250 kDa was 
specifically increased in  the extract from  cells  which  had been  pretreated with 

134

NGF or EGF. The stimulation of kinase activity seen in situ occurred  rapidly 
(maximal  within  5 min)  in  response  to  the  growth  factors  and  transiently, 
dropping to near baseline after 30 min of continual treatment. The in vitro kinase 
activity was unaffected by cAMP, Ca + +, or trifluoperazine suggesting it was not 
A-kinase, C-kinase, or CAMP kinase (LANDRETH and RIESER  1985). Phosphoryl(cid:173)
ation of pp250 was however, stimulated by phorbol ester treatment of the intact 
cells in a manner which was  not additive with NGF (LANDRETH  and WILLIAMS 
1987).  The ability  to  reproduce  the  phosphorylation of this  protein  in  soluble 
extracts  (LANDRETH  and WILLIAMS  1987)  should facilitate  the  purification and 
characterization of both kinase  and substrate. 

In  three  instances,  decreased  32P04  labeling  of proteins  was  reported  in 
response  to  NGF.  This  was  first  reported  for  histone  H2a  (HALEGOUA  and 
PATRICK  1980). It was not determined whether this was due to decreased kinase 
activity or increased phosphatase activity caused by the NGF treatment. Another 
protein,  of  100 kDa,  whose  phosphorylation  was  similarly  found  to  become 
decreased in response to NGF, was described in PC12 cells (END et al.  1982) and 
later  in  NGF  responsive  cultured  neurons  (HAMA  and  GUROFF  1985).  This 
protein  phosphorylation was  also  found  to  be  decreased  in  response  to  FGF 
treatment ofPC12 cells (ToGARI et al. 1985; RYDEL and GREENE 1987). Decreased 
labeling of this protein, designated NSP 100, was observed within 15 min ofNGF 
treatment, and this  effect  was  retained  in  cell  free  extracts from  NGF treated 
PC12 cells. This decreased phosphorylation of NSP 100 in cell extracts (TOGARI 
and  GUROFF  1985)  was  also  seen  in  response  to  EGF,  PMA,  the.  adenosine 
receptor agonist NECA (END et al. 1983), and by elevation of intracellular Ca + + 
or  cAMP (HASHIMOTO  et al.  1986).  Furthermore,  in  contrast  to  increased  TH 
phosphorylation, decreased NSP  100  phosphorylation in response to  NGF or 
cAMP elevation requires the presence of extracellular Ca + +  (HASIDMOTO  et al. 
1986).  NSP  100  and  its  kinase  were  partially  purified  and  the  NGF  effect 
reconstituted  (ToGARI  and  GUROFF  1985;  HAMA  et al.  1986).  These  studies 
concluded  that  the  decreased  phosphorylation  of  NSP  100  by  NGF  was 
mediated by an activation of C-kinase which  then phosphorylated and inacti(cid:173)
vated a  distinct  NSP 100 kinase. 

Several  recent  studies  have  attempted  to  evaluate  the  role  of C-kinase  in 
NGF-induced  neurite  outgrowth.  Phorbol  ester  derivatives  which  stimulate 
C-kinase  have  been  found  to  promote  neurite  outgrowth  caused  by  NGF 
(CHANDLER  and  HERSCHMAN  1980).  Two  recent  studies  have  attempted  to 
specifically  eliminate  C-kinase  activity  from  PC12  cells  to  test  the  potential 
requirement  of  C-kinase  in  NGF-induced  neurite  outgrowth.  In  one  case, 
sphingosine, a drug reported to inhibit C-kinase in vitro and in vivo in some cell 
types was used (HALL et al. 1988). Treatment of cells with relatively high doses of 
sphingosine  was  reported  to  block  NGF-induced  neurite  outgrowth  in  a 
reversible  manner.  The  drug  was  also  found  to  inhibit  NGF  stimulated 
incorporation of 32P04 into a wide array of proteins seen on one-dimensional 
gels, a result which was suggested to indicate the inhibition ofC-kinase. However, 
the specific enhanced incorporation of label into TH by NGF was still seen in the 

Dissecting the  Mode of Action of a  Neuronal Growth Factor 

135 

presence of the drug. The authors concluded that the activation of C-kinase by 
NGF was required for neurite outgrowth. In our laboratory, sphingosine, over a 
wide range of concentrations, was not able to inhibit either phorbol ester-induced 
or NGF-stimulated phosphorylation ofTH in PC12 cells (R.  ARMSTRONG and S. 
HALEGOUA,  unpublished work).  At high concentrations of sphingosine, such  as 
those used in the above study, the cells became detached from  the culture dish, 
calling  into  question  inhibitory  effects  of  this  drug.  In  a  subsequent  study, 
prolonged treatment with phorbol esters was used to down regulate C-kinase in 
PC12  cells  (YOUNG  et al.  1987).  Long-term  treatment  of  PC12  cells  with 
phorbol dibutyrate (PDBU)  was  found  to  decrease  C-kinase activity levels  by 
about 90% (REINHOLD  and NEET  1989), with no effect on NGF-induced neurite 
outgrowth. The authors concluded that C-kinase was not essential to this NGF 
action. However, in view of both the variety ofC-kinase isoforms that exist, which 
have different sensitivities to phospholipids, diacylglycerols and phorbol esters, 
and their different  subcellular locations, negative results from  down regulation 
experiments must be viewed with caution. For example, in our laboratory, down 
regulation  with  PMA  was  able  to  block  TH  phosphorylation  normally 
stimulated by this phorbol ester. However TH phosphorylation was stimulated 
by PDBU or dioctanoylglycerol (DOG) in these same PMA down regulated cells 
(1. CREMINS, R. ARMSTRONG, and S. HALEGOUA unpublished work). Identification 
of the C-kinase isoforms and their relative abundance and subcellular locations 
in PC12 cells must be studied further before definitive conclusions can be drawn 
from  the above studies. 

A summary of second  messenger  pathways,  their interactions, and protein 
phosphorylation events which have in some ways been linked to these pathways 
is presented in Fig.  3. It is abundantly clear that NGF action involves changes in 
the phosphorylation state of a variety of different proteins. These changes include 
increased  and  decreased  phosphorylations  mediated  through  enhanced  or 
reduced  kinase  activities  and  appear  to  include  changes  in  phosphoprotein 
phosphatase activities as well. The phosphorylation events occur during a broad 
time  range  after  NGF addition and in many cases involve  kinase  cascades.  A 
number of the phosphorylated proteins have been identified and in one case thus 
far the phosphorylation ofTH resulted in activation ofthe enzyme (and increased 
catecholamine synthesis). Other identified kinase substrates have functions more 
difficult to assess,  but the correlation of phosphorylation with NGF treatment 
and actions  suggests a  physiological importance.  Although most of the  kinase 
actions identified to date involve modifications of serine and threonine residues, 
phosphorylations on tyro sines have also recently been described (MAHER  1988). 
As  discussed  below,  the tyrosine kinase activities  are rapidly activated and are 
likely to  be  mediators of signal transduction for NGF. As  illustrated in  Fig. 3, 
some second messenger pathways stimulated by NGF may not involve protein 
phosphorylations. Their mode of action  remains  to  be  determined.

Dissecting the Mode of Action of a Neuronal Growth  Factor 

137 

3.5  Proto-Oncogenes 

From the studies above it is apparent that multiple second messenger pathways 
may be involved in the various actions ofNGF. The generation of these second 
messenger molecules  result  from  the  binding of NGF to  its  receptor,  the sole 
product  of  a  single  gene.  It  appears  that  a  single,  high  affinity  receptor  is 
responsible for mediating all NGF actions (see CHAO, this volume). As the NGF 
receptor, unlike other growth factor receptors, has no known intrinsic enzymatic 
activity, it must apparently interact with  at least one other signal  transducing 
molecule. The identification of such companion molecules has only recently been 
undertaken. 

The  guanyl  nucleotide  binding  proteins  (G-proteins)  (for  review  see 
GILMAN  1984; NEER and CLAPHAM  1988) are the only class of signal transducers 
known  to  be  linked  to  a  variety  of receptors  including  those  for  hormones, 
neurotransmitters,  and  light.  The  G-proteins  become  activated  and  bind 
guanosine  triphosphate (GTP)  after  linking  to ligand-occupied  receptors  and 
inactivated after hydrolyzing bound GTP (intrinsic GTPase activity). The best 
characterized  G-protein  is  GS'  which  when  activated  in  response  to  ligand 
binding, stimulates adenylate cyclase. Since NGF action appears to involve the 
production  of cAMP  and  the  activation  of A-kinase,  the  ability  of NGF  to 
stimulate adenylate cyclase has been examined (RACE and WAGNER 1985). In this 
study, adenylate cyclase activity in vivo was determined by measuring the rate of 
[3H]cAMP production from  [3H]adenosine. Although NGF treatment did not 
stimulate  [3H]cAMP  production,  isoproterenol  (which  acts  through  the  Gs 
linked p-adrenergic receptor) stimulated eH]cAMP production by tenfold. This 
study raised the possibilities that cAMP accumulation by NGF might be due to 
either phosphodiesterase inhibition or that NGF might use an alternative means 
of activating A-kinase. Thus, the potential involvement of Gs  or other pathways 
for  A-kinase activation by NGF remain to be elucidated.  Although no simple 
means of directly inhibiting Gs  exists, pertussis  toxin (PT) catalyzes the ADP(cid:173)
ribosylation  and  resulting  inactivation  of several  G-proteins,  including  those 
which  mediate  inhibition  of adenylate  cyclase  and  stimulate  PI  turnover.  As 
discussed above, PT blocks that portion ofNGF-induced PI turnover which is 
carried out through a cAMP dependent pathway. However, the majority of the 
NGF stimulated PI turnover is not blocked by PT and is thus not carried out by 
PT  sensitive  G-proteins  (J.  CREMINS  and  S.  HALEGOUA,  unpublished  work). 
Furthermore, prolonged  treatment of PC12  with  PT before  and during NGF 
treatment  was  only  slightly  inhibitory  for  neurite  outgrowth  (S.  HALEGOUA, 
unpublished  work).  These  negative  results  stimulated  the  search  for  other 
potential G-protein-like molecules as NGF signal transducers. 

The ras gene family  encodes membrane bound proteins with GTP binding 
and  hydrolyzing  activity  (BARBACID  1987).  It has  been  suggested  that  these 
proteins playa role analogous to G-proteins in mediating cell proliferation by 
growth factors and hormones, because "activated" (Le., viral or mutant) forms of 
these  proteins  promote  cell  proliferation  (BARBACID  1987)  and  because  their

inactivation, such as by microinjection of antibodies to ras proteins, blocks these 
growth promoting effects (SMITH et al. 1986). Surprisingly, however, the introduc(cid:173)
tion of Ha-ras or N-ras oncogenes into PC12 cells by viral infection (NODA et al. 
1985),  transfection  (GUERRERO  et al.  1986),  or microinjection of the oncogenic 
Ha-ras protein (BAR-SAGI  and FERAMISCO  1985)  resulted in the morphological 
differentiation ofPC12 cells in the absence ofNGF. This result suggested that the 
oncogenic, activated ras proteins may couple to the same intracellular signaling 
pathways as the occupied NGF receptor. For example, when the N-ras oncogene 
in a retroviral vector was transfected into PC12 cells it resulted in the extensive 
outgrowth  of neurities,  similar  to  those  produced  by  NGF  (GUERRERO  et al. 
1986). However, the morphological effects ofN-ras differed from that ofNGF in 
that N-ras caused an unusual somatic enlargement followed by cell degeneration 
within about 2 weeks after transfection. In a subsequent study, the v-Ha-ras gene, 
engineered  under  the  control  of the  mouse  mammary  tumor  virus  (MMTV) 
promotor, was stably transfected into PC12 cells and induced with dexameth(cid:173)
asone (SUGIMOTO et al.  1988). In this system, both v-Ha-ras and NGF similarly 
caused  Li + -inhibitable neurite outgrowth, transcription dependent priming of 
the cells for subsequent rapid neurite outgrowth by NGF (see below), survival in 
serum free  medium, and increases of acetylcholinesterase activity. Induction of 
N-ras in PC12 transfectants resulted in the induction of ODC (GUERRERO et al. 
1988.),  as  did  treatment  of PC12  cells  with  NGF.  However,  the characteristic 
rapid induction of the c-fos gene in response to NGF was not observed after N(cid:173)
ras induction, leading to the suggestion that ras p21  does not mediate this NGF 
effect. This result is surprising in light ofthe fact that oncogenic mutants of Ha-ras 
or N-ras are able to cause induction of the endogenous c-fos gene in fibroblasts 
(STACEY  et al.  1987)  and  of c-fos  promoter-chloramphenicoi  acetyltransferase 
(CAT)  constructs  transfected  into  PC12  cells  (SASSONE-CORSI  et al.  1989). 
However,  the  initial  induction  of  MMTV-N-ras  by  dexamethasone  is  slow 
(occurring over many hours) relative to the  rapid (within  5 min)  and transient 
(complete within 2 h) induction of c-fos seen in response to acute activators such 
as NGF. It is thus possible that N-ras-mediated induction of c-fos was obscured 
by  the  rapid,  transient,  and  refractory  nature  of  c-fos  gene  regulation  (see 
Sect. 4.1). 

An independent study has addressed the possible role of the cellular ras p21 
proteins in mediating one specific aspect of NGF action, neurite outgrowth. In 
this study, a monoclonal anti-ras p21 antibody was microinjected into PC12 cells 
in order to block ras p21  protein function (HAGAG et al.  1986). To eliminate the 
deleterious effects of micropipette impalement on the small PC12 cell, these cells 
were first fused  to create NGF responsive, giant multinucleated cells (O'LAGUE 
and HUTTNER 1980). Microinjection of anti-ras p21 antibody into the fused PC12 
cells  completely blocked  neurite  outgrowth by  NGF (HAGAG  et al.  1986)  and 
FGF  (N.  KREMER,  J.  BRUGGE  and  S.  HALEGOUA,  unpublished  work).  These 
antibody results  have  recently  been  confirmed  by  the  introduction into  PC12 
cells of an inactive but competing mutant Ha-ras (FEIG and COOPER 1988). Taken 
together, the above results suggest that the product of a member of the ras gene 

Dissecting the  Mode of Action  of a  Neuronal Growth Factor 

139 

family either directly or indirectly mediates the coupling of NG F  receptors and 
FGF receptors to the intracellular mediators of neurite outgrowth. Introduction 
of v-Ha-ras p21  into cultured neurons has recently been found to alleviate their 
dependence  on  NGF,  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF),  and  ciliary 
neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (DOMENICO  BORASIO et al.  1989) further suggesting 
a  common role  for  ras  in  mediating neuronal growth factor  action. 

One of the limitations in understanding the role ofras in NGF action is  that 
the understanding of ras in other physiological processes and in oncogenesis is 
still  incomplete.  In  yeast  cells  the  ras  genes  are  coupled  to  adenylate  cyclase 
(ToDA et al.  1985). However, this function has not been seen in mammalian cells. 
Several  reports  have  connected  ras  protein  activity  with  the  generation  of PI 
metabolites.  The  ras  oncogene products were  found  to  result  in  the  increased 
production  of  PI  metabolites,  particularly  diacylglycerol  (see  for  example 
FLEISCHMAN  et al.  1986).  However,  as  with  NGF,  much  of the  diacylglycerol 
production by ras  proteins has been suggested  to  be  derived from  lipids  other 
than PI (LACAL et al.  1987). Microinjection of Ha-ras p21  proteins has also been 
shown to rapidly stimulate phospholipase A2activity (BAR-SAGI and FERAMISCO 
1986).  Since  NGF was  found  to  stimulate  protein phosphorylation caused  by 
stimulation of A-kinase as well as C-kinase (see above), it was suggested that ras 
p21  proteins  may  mediate  stimulation  of  either  or  both  of  these  pathways 
(HAGAG  et al.  1986).  In support of this. hypothesis, SUGIMOTO  et al.  (1988)  have 
found  that  v-Ha-ras  induction  in  PC12  resulted  in  the  stimulation  of cAMP 
production  and  PI  turnover.  Furthermore,  H a-ras  oncogenes  were  found  to 
cause gene inductions through the serum response element of the c-fos gene and 
through the phorbol ester response element (TRE) in PC12 cells (SASSONE-CORSI 
et al.  1989).  However,  the  long  lag  time  for  production  of  PI  and  cAMP 
metabolities in these cells (SUGIMOTO et al.  1988) are difficult to reconcile with ras 
protein  acting  as  an  immediate  coupler  to  these  pathways.  An  additional 
complexity  has  been  presented  by  Yu  et al.  (1988),  who  suggested  that  ras 
proteins  act  at  a  step  subsequent  to  PI  turnover  in  mediating  proliferation 
responses in 3T3 cells. The coupling ofNGF receptors to intracellular mediators, 
such as cAMP and PI turnover, through a ras protein thus remains an intriguing 
hypothesis. However, it is likely that ras is  only one component of a novel and 
complex signal transduction pathway for  NGF action (see  below). 

One class of receptors with an intrinsic signal transduction capability is that 
of the  mitogenic  growth  factors.  These  receptors  contain  a  carboxy  terminal 
cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase  domain which  is  activated  by  ligand  binding and 
which  is  necessary  for  signal  transduction.  Although  NGF  receptor  does  not 
appear to contain tyrosine kinase activity, several lines of evidence point to a role 
for tyrosine kinase (and possibly a src kinase) in mediating NGF action. The first 
indication that tyrosine kinase activity may playa role in neuronal differentiation 
came from infection of PC12 cells with Rous Sarcoma Virus (ALEMA et al.  1985). 
Although  infection  of  most  cell  types  by  this  virus  results  in  carcinogenic 
transformation,  the  viral  infection  of  PC12  cells  resulted  in  morphological 
differentiation via the src kinase, similar to that produced by NGF treatment. To

further examine the differentiation of PC12 cells induced by v-src, cloned v-src 
mutants which encode a temperature sensitive v-src (ts v-src) kinase activity was 
stably  transfected  into  PC12  cells  (RAUSCH  et aI.  1989;  S.  THOMAS,  M.  HAYES, 
G.  D'ARCANGELO,  R.  ARMSTRONG,  M.  DEMARCO,  J.  BRUGGE,  and S.  HALEGOUA, 
unpublished  work). In  such  PC12  transfectants,  shifts  in  the  growth  tempera(cid:173)
ture control both src  activity and src-induced differentiation (ts  v-src is  active at 
35°C and  inactive  at  41 0q.  The use  of these  cell  lines  has  demonstrated  that 
src-induced and NGF-induced differentiation share many characteristics besides 
neurite  outgrowth.  The  differentiation  is  reversible,  proceeds  long-term  (over 
weeks), is able to prime subsequent rapid neurite regrowth by NGF, and includes 
the  induction  of genes  also  stimulated  by  NGF such  as  c-fos,  NGFla,  thy  1, 
SCGlO, and ODe. In contrast to NGF, v-src induced neurite outgrowth is  cell 
density  independent  (S.  THOMAS  et aI.,  unpublished  work)  and  tetrodotoxin 
(TTX)-sensitive  Na +  channels  are  not  induced,  suggesting  that  these  effects 
may reflect  unique steps in the NGF signal transduction cascade. 

The above results raise the interesting question of whether c-src, or another 
tyrosine  kinase,  is  involved  in  differentiation  by  NGF.  This  issue  has  been 
addressed in two ways.  MAHER (1988) assessed tyrosine kinase activity in PC12 
cells by performing Western blotting of PC12 proteins and probing with anti(cid:173)
phosphotyrosine  antibodies.  She  found  that  NGF  treatment  of cells  rapidly 
(within 2 min of treatment) resulted in increased binding of these antibodies to 
specific  protein  bands  in  the  blot,  suggesting  that  NGF  stimulated  protein 
phosphorylations on tyrosine residues. The pattern of proteins was similar but 
not identical to that obtained in response to EGF treatment of the cells. Unlike 
EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylations by the EGF receptor kinase, those 
stimulated by NGF were attenuated by low temperature. These results and the 
fact that the NGF receptor cDNA does not appear to encode a  tyrosine kinase 
were taken to imply that NGF receptor activates a tyrosine kinase with which it 
may interact. The same anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies used in immunofluores(cid:173)
cence staining of PC12 cells illuminated components which were correlated with 
the localization of actin filaments particularly at the neurite growth cone (MAHER 
1989), where c-src (SOBUE and KANDA 1988) and NGF receptors are also localized 
in PC12 cells (LEVI  et aI.  1980). 

In a set of experiments carried out recently in our laboratory, the potential 
requirement for c-src kinase in NGF action has been assessed. Microinjection of 
a  specific  monoclonal anti-src antibody (MAb  327)  has  been found  to inhibit 
v-src-stimulated DNA synthesis in fibroblasts (J.  WALTON,  J.  FERAMISCO and J. 
BRUGGE, unpublished work). We have found that microinjection ofMAb 327 into 
fused PC12 cells stably expressing the ts v-src gene prevented neurite outgrowth 
at  the  permissive  temperature  (N.  KREMER,  J.  BRUGGE,  and  S.  HALEGOUA, 
unpublished work). Microinjection of these antibodies into fused PC12 cells also 
resulted  in  the  block  of  NGF-induced  neurite  outgrowth  and  could  cause 
retraction  of already  extended  neurites.  These  results  indicate  that  src  (or  an 
unidentified  closely  related  antigen)  plays  an  essential  role  in  NGF-induced 
neurite outgrowth. Whether c-src is the kinase responsible for the observed NGF 
stimulated tyrosine  phosphorylations remains to be determined. 

Dissecting the Mode of Action of a  Neuronal Growth  Factor 

141 

From the above studies it is apparent that members of both the c-src and c-ras 
gene families may play essential roles in mediating NGF action. These results are 
most easily interpreted by a  model in which NGF results in the stimulation of 
both  src  and  ras  p21  to  act  sequentially  in  a  signal  transduction  pathway. 
Microinjection studies in fibroblasts have shown that anti-ras antibodies block 
v-src-induced transformation. This result suggests a preferred order for src and 
ras  functions  in  NGF-induced  differentiation  with  src  occurring  first,  and 
ras  activity  occurring  downstream.  Further  support  for  this  model  comes 
from  additional  microinjection  experiments  (N.  KREMER,  J.  BRUGGE,  and  S. 
HALEGOUA,  in  preparation).  Injection of anti-ras antibody into  src-transfected 
PC12 cells blocks v-src-induced neurite outgrowth. Importantly, the converse is 
not true. Injection of anti-src antibody does not inhibit neurite outgrowth from 
dexamethasone-treated  PC12  cells  stably  expressing  an  MMTV-ras  fusion 
gene. 

The results discussed above underscore the striking similarities between src 
and  ras  functions  in  mitogenesis  and  neuronal  differentiation.  Although  the 
molecular details of the oncogene relationships are at present unclear, a clue may 
lie  in  the  GTPase activating protein (GAP) which  can  associate  with  ras  p21. 
GAP  has  recently  been  identified  as  a  major  substrate  for  tyrosine  kinases, 
(ELLIS  et al.  1990).  Thus,  tyrosine  phosphorylation  by  src  and  the  resultant 
inactivation of GAP could be  one means  of elevating ras  p21  activity. 

While  these  results  support  the  above  model  in  which  a  src-like  tyrosine 
kinase  mediates  NGF-induced  neurite  outgrowth  through  a  ras-related 
G-protein,  it  does  not  preclude  differentiating  effects  of src  which  may  occur 
independently of ras p21  or of NGF receptor acting independently of src or ras 
p21.  A comparative  analysis  of various  markers  of differentiation  induced  by 
NGF  and  by  the src  and  ras  oncogenes  combined  with  antibody  blocking 
experiments may further  reveal  multiple pathways of NGF-induced differenti(cid:173)
ation.  These  experiments  together  with  those  assessing  the  various  second 
messenger activities stimulated by NGF (see above and Fig.  3) may shed light on 
the specific transduction  pathways which  underlie NGF actions. 

3.6  Pharmacological Inhibitors 

Interference with NGF signal transduction by drugs has provided an approach 
toward identification of target transducing molecules.  Drugs which can inhibit 
selectively  NGF  action,  but  not  other  receptor-mediated  events,  have  been 
particularly useful. The first class of drugs with this property are the inhibitors of 
methylation  reactions,  such  as  methylthioadenosine  (MT A).  Such  drugs  were 
found  to block NGF-induced neurite outgrowth but not EGF actions (SEELEY 
et al.  1984), suggesting a role for either protein or phospholipid methylation in 
NGF  action.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  earlier  data  showing  that  NGF 
stimulated phospholipid methylation in primary neuronal cultures (PFENNINGER 
and JOHNSON  1981; SKAPER  and VARON  1984). The importance of phospholipid 
methylation was examined more carefully in PC12 cells by FEAAARI and GREENE 

142 

S.  HaJegoua,  R. C.  Armstrong, and N.  E.  Kremer 

(1985).  Using  eH]methyl-methionine labeling  of PC12  cultures,  these  inves(cid:173)
tigators  saw  no  effect  of NGF  on  phospholipid  labeling.  Furthermore,  con(cid:173)
centrations of methylation inhibitors which  blocked phospholipid methylation 
had no effect on NGF-induced neurite growth. The results therefore suggested 
that  the  inhibition  of neurite  growth  by  methylation  inhibitors  occurred  at 
concentrations  more  consistent  with  the  inhibitors'  ability  to  inhibit  protein 
methylation.  Given  the  higher  concentrations  of  MT A  required  for  neurite 
inhibition,  it  is  also  possible  that  other  reactions  might  be  the  critical  ones 
inhibited.  For example,  recent  reports  have  indicated  that  MTA  is  a  potent 
inhibitor in vitro and in vivo of both an NGF-stimulated pp 250  protein kinase 
(SMITH  et al.  1989)  and  the  tyrosine  kinase  stimulation  produced  by  NGF 
treatment  (MAHER  1988).  Because  similar  events  induced  by  EGF  are  not 
blocked, it suggests that the drug target may lie close to the NGF receptor in the 
signal transduction pathway. The differentiating action of FGF on PC12 cells is 
also  blocked  by  MT A,  indicating  that a  receptor-mediated event  common  to 
NGF and FGF is  affected  by  the drug.  Whether the essential site of action  of 
MT A is a kinase, methyltransferase, or other cellular component remains to be 
determined. 

Another drug of interest which has more recently been described is  K252a. 
This drug was first discovered to inhibit C-kinase both in vivo and in vitro. It has 
since been found to inhibit a variety of protein kinases. When tried on PC 12 cells, 
K252a was found to be a highly specific inhibitor of NGF action. It appears to 
block every NGF action thus far tested, from tyrosine kinase and serine kinase 
stimulations  to  gene  inductions  and  neurite  outgrowth  (HASHIMOTO  1988; 
KOIZUMI et al. 1988; CHO et al. 1989; LAZAROVICI et al. 1989; MAHER 1989; SMITH 
et al. 1989). No similar actions by FGF or EGF appear to be affected by the drug. 
It has thus been suggested that K252a blocks an event specific to NGF receptor 
action, and it has also been suggested that it may act by inhibiting the tyrosine 
kinase  stimulated  by  NGF  (MAHER  1989).  However,  v-src  induced  neurite 
outgrowth is unaffected by the drug (RAUSCH et al.  1989). Since it does not affect 
NGF  binding  to  receptor,  K252a  may  block  an  initial  transduction  event, 
perhaps a kinase activation. However, as with MT A, the essential site(s) of action 
for  K252a have yet  to be identified. 

4  Regulation of Gene  Expression 

Our  present  model  for  NGF-induced  differentiation  (Fig.  1)  invokes  major 
changes in gene expression. The first suggestion that changes in gene expression 
were  important  in  NGF  action  came  from  studies  on  NGF-induced  neurite 
outgrowth. After NGF addition to PC12 cells, there is a characteristic lag time of 
about 48 h before  neurite outgrowth is  observed.  Inhibition of RNA  synthesis 
during  this  lag  time  results  in  a  block  of  neurite  outgrowth.  The  use  of 

Dissecting the Mode of Action  of a  Neuronal  Growth Factor 

143 

camptothecin at a level which blocks only 30% of total RNA synthesis completely 
blocks neurite outgrowth by NGF. Cells which are treated with NGF for periods 
longer  than  the  lag  time  can  rapidly  regenerate  neurities  after  replating  with 
NGF, even  in  the  absence  of RNA  synthesis.  Elicitation  of the  capability  for 
precocious  neurite  growth  in  the  absence  of RNA  synthesis  has  been  termed 
"priming" (GREENE  et al.  1982).  FGF can also  prime  PC12 cells:  FGF-primed 
PC12 cells  will  elicit  neurite regeneration in  response  to  subsequent treatment 
with either NGF or FGF (TOGARI  et al.  1985;  RYDEL  and GREENE  1987). These 
data  led  to  the  conclusion  that  neurite  outgrowth  by  NGF  and  FGF  was 
mediated by the transcriptional activation of gene(s) encoding proteins required 
for  neurite outgrowth. 

The first  studies  of NGF-induced  alterations  in  protein  synthesis  changes 
were of a general nature and used one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 
to  resolve  the  protein  species  (MCGUIRE  et al.  1978;  GARRELS  and  SCHUBERT 
1979;  MCGUIRE  and  GREENE  1980;  TIERCY  and  SHOOTER  1986).  Using  these 
techniques,  only  small  quantitative  changes  in  the  synthesis  of  proteins  in 
response  to  NGF  were  found.  Using  two-dimensional  gel  electrophoresis, 
incorporation  of  eH]fucose  and  eH]glucosamine  into  a  230 kDa  protein 
termed  NGF  inducible  large  external  glycoprotein  (NILE)  was  found  to  be 
stimulated  by  NGF  after  2  days  of  treatment.  NILE  synthesis,  but  not  its 
glycosylation,  was  stimulated  about  threefold  by  NGF (MCGUIRE  et al.  1978) 
and  FGF  (RYDEL  and  GREENE  1987).  The  increased  synthesis  by  NGF  was 
blocked  by  camptothecin,  suggesting  a  requirement  for  RNA  synthesis.  The 
potential  role  of NILE  in  PC12  adhesion  and  in  neurite  outgrowth  will  be 
discussed in Sect.  5.  GARRELS  and SCHUBERT  (1979) quantitatively analyzed the 
synthesis of over 800 proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins 
labeled  with  eSS]methionine  in  PC12  cells  after  2  days  of  NGF  treatment. 
Among these proteins, NGF treatment resulted in from 30% to tenfold changes in 
a number of proteins but no qualitative changes in protein synthetic rates. A more 
recent study of PC12 protein synthesis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 
focused  on changes  during the first  few  hours  of NGF treatment (TIERCY  and 
SHOOTER  1986). Several quantitative increases in synthetic rates of proteins were 
found  which  were  blocked  by the  transcription inhibitor, actinomycin  D.  One 
study  (MCGUIRE  and  GREENE  1980)  using  one-dimensional  SDS-PAGE  to 
analyze  [3SS]methionine  labeled  PC12  proteins  concentrated  on  an  as  yet 
unidentified protein of 80 kDa (p80) whose synthesis was found to be maximally 
stimulated by NGF after 2~3 days of treatment. The induction and maintenance 
of p80 synthesis by NGF was found  to be selectively sensitive to camptothecin. 
More  directed  approaches  have  been  aimed  at  identifying  proteins  whose 
syntheses are regulated by NGF to promote the outgrowth ofneurities. Included 
in  this  class  are  MAPs,  including  the  chartin  proteins (BLACK  et al.  1986),  tau 
proteins,  and  tubulins  (DRUBIN  et al.  1985),  the  synthesis  of all  of  which  are 
increased  by  NGF. The  regulation  of PC12 intermediate filament  proteins  by 
NGF has also been approached using diverse methods. In immunocytochemical 
studies  using  monospecific  antibodies  against  each  of the  three  neurofilament

subunit  proteins  and  vimentin,  increased  cell  staining  suggested  that  the 
abundance of these proteins was increased after NGF treatment (LEE et al.  1982; 
LEE and PAGE  1984). Some of these findings were confirmed and extended using 
one- and  two-dimensional  gel  electrophoresis  and  immunoprecipitation  (LEE 
1985; LINDENBAUM et al.  1987). The increased production of the three neurofila(cid:173)
ment protein subunits (NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H) were found to be differentially 
regulated by NGF, with NF -H being increased much more slowly and to a lesser 
extent.  Since  vimentin  is  not  detected  in  PC12  cells  by  two-dimensional  gel 
analysis, cell staining with the anti-vimentin antibodies was likely due to cross(cid:173)
reactivity  with  peripherin (PORTIER  et al.  1982,  1983).  This  protein was  found 
to  be  induced  by  NGF  in  PC12  cells  (PARYSEK  and  GOLDMAN  1987).  The 
molecular cloning of cDNAs for tubulin, MAPs and peripherin and the use of 
these cDNAs to study regulation of these genes by NGF will be discussed below 
in Sect.  4.2. 

Other directed approaches have included assays for specific enzyme activities 
such as choline acetyltransferase (ScHUBERTet al.  1977; GREENE and REIN  1977), 
TH  (GOODMAN  and  HERSCHMAN  1978),  acetylcholinesterase  (AChE)  (see  for 
example LUCAS et al. 1980; RmGER et al.1980), ODC (see for example HATANAKA 
et al.1978; HUFF and GUROFF 1979), Na + /K +  ATPase (INoUEet al. 1988}, neuron 
specific  enolase  (VINORES  et al.  1981),  2'-5'  oligo  A  synthetase,  and  2'  phos(cid:173)
phodiesterase (SAARMA  et al.  1986) which are all stimulated by NGF treatment. 
ODC (TOGARI  et al.  1985;  RYDEL  and GREENE  1987)  and  AChE  (RYDEL  and 
GREJlNE  1989) levels are also increased in response to FGF. These increases in 
activity have generally been shown to be due at least in part to increases in protein 
levels of the enzymes. Curiously, the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase was described 
as a single stranded DNA binding protein whose protein and mRNA levels are 
reduced by NGF; the relevance of this observation is thus far speculative (BIOCCA 
et al. 1984; CALISSANO et al. 1985). Levels of poly ADP-ribose synthetase are also 
reduced  by NGF treatment (TANIGUCm  et al.  1988).  In  addition  to  enzymes, 
several neuropeptide transmitters including neurotensin (interestingly, glucocor(cid:173)
ticoid is  permissive for  NGF induction of neurotensin [TISCHLER  et al.  1982]) 
and neuropeptide Y (ALLEN et al.  1984) and neurotransmitter receptors such as 
acetylcholine receptors (JUMBLATT and TISCHLER 1982; MITSUKA and HATANAKA 
1984) and enkephalin receptors (INOUE and HATANAKA 1982) have been found to 
be induced by NGF in PC12 cells.  By contrast, the EGF receptor is  repressed, 
which may playa role in the NGF inhibition of cell division (LAZAROVICI et al. 
1987).  Secreted  forms  of the  fJ-amyloid  precursor  (SCHUBERT  et al.  1989)  and 
levels of synapsin I (ROMANO et al.  1987) are also increased by NGF treatment.

The  changes  in  electrical  properties  in  PC12  cells  treated  with  NGF  have 
included the induction of both voltage dependent Na + channels (DICHTER et al. 
1977) and Ca + +  channels (see for example TAKAHAsm et al.  1985; GARBER et al. 
1989). Complementary DNA clones are now available for a number of the above 
proteins and  studies  of mRNA regulation  by  NGF using  these  clones  will  be 
discussed  below. 

Molecular studies ofNGF action have focused on identifying components of 
two classes of genes. One class encodes proteins which contribute directly to the 
differentiated sympathetic neuronal phenotype, such as those for proteins which 
are  components  of  neuritic  processes.  The  other  class  of genes  contributes 
indirectly to the neuronal phenotype by causing the activation of downstream 
genes which are directly involved in NGF actions. What has emerged from these 
studies is a precise time sequence of gene inductions occurring over an interval 
spanning 5 min to several days of continuous NG F treatment (Fig. 4). Studies of 
the induced genes, their mode of induction, and their relationships to each other 
and  to  the  establishment  of  neuronal  characteristics  are  making  valuable 
contributions to a  molecular framework  of NGF action. 

4.1  Primary Response  Genes 

Parallels have been drawn between cellular genes induced by growth factors and 
genes induced upon viral infection. In virology, "immediate early genes" were first 
defined as those genes encoded by viruses which are expressed very early and only 
transiently  during  viral  infection  of mammalian  cells.  The  induction  of these 
genes upon viral infection is unique in that they do not require ongoing protein 
synthesis  but  rather  are  "superinduced"  in  the  presence  of protein  synthesis 
inhibitors, due in part to stabilization of their mRNAs. In the extrapolation of the 
viral cycle to a model for growth factor action (see Fig. 1) a set of cellular genes are 
rapidly  (within  minutes)  induced  by  growth  factors  and can  be  superinduced 
when protein synthesis is blocked. Genes of this class (primary response genes), 
induced by growth factors and other mitogenic stimuli, have been identified and 
cloned. Primary response gene induction is not restricted to mitogenic stimuli but 
occurs in differentiating and other modulatory systems. NGF-induced neuronal 
differentiation of PC12 cells also falls into this category. The rapidity with which 
primary response genes are turned on suggests that their induction is likely to be a 
direct  result  of second  messenger  action.  In  general,  a  role  of primary  res(cid:173)
ponse genes  as  transcriptional  trans-activators  has  been  suggested  to provide 
a  link  between  rapid  second  messenger  stimula'tion  and  long-term  gene 
induction. 

The first primary response gene to be characterized was the proto-oncogene 
c-fos,  the  cellular  counterpart  of the  transforming  v-fos  gene  of two  murine 
retroviruses  (for  review  see  CURRAN  1988).  The  c-fos  gene  is  turned  on  by 
polypeptide  growth  factors  which  stimulate  mitogenesis,  in  cells  which  are 
induced  to  differentiate,  and  in  post-mitotic  neurons  which  are  electrically

stimulated (MULLER  et al.  1984).  PC12 cells  have provided an ideal  system for 
studying the molecular basis of all of these  paradigms of c-fos  induction. 

Stimulation of at least three major second messenger pathways can lead to 
c-fos  induction  in  PC12  cells.  Activation  of C-kinase  by  phorbol  esters  or 
diacylglycerol  derivatives,  cAMP elevation  by  chemical  derivatives  of cAMP 
or  by  cholera  toxin,  and  elevation  of intracellular  free  Ca + +  by  membrane 
depolarization or by the Ca + + ionophore A23187 have all been shown to induce 
c-fos  (KRUIJER  et al.  1985;  GREENBERG  et al.  1985;  SHENG  et al.  1988; 
R. ARMSTRONG and S.  HALEGOUA,  unpublished work). In addition, stimulation of 
the tyrosine kinase EGF receptor or the putative tyrosine kinase FGF receptor 
(GREENBERG  and  ZIFF  1984),  and  the  v-src  tyrosine  kinase  (FuJII  et al.  1989; 
R. ARMSTRONG and S. HALEGOUA, unpublished work) induce c-fos. In all of these 
cases, as with NGF, the kinetics of c-fos induction are rapid and transient, with 
gene transcription beginning within 5 min of the stimulus, peaking at 15-30 min, 
and returning to basal levels within  1 h. 

Multiple genetic elements found in the upstream region of the c-fos gene are 
responsible  for  its  induction.  One  element  with  dyad  symmetry  has  been 
identified which causes the induction of a reporter gene such as bacterial CAT to 
which  it  has  been  linked  (TREISMAN  1985).  The  dyad-reporter  fusion  gene  is 
induced in  PC12 cells  in  response  to  C-kinase  activation,  NGF (SHENG  et al. 
1988), and other growth factors.  The fusion gene is also induced in response to 
serum  stimulation of fibroblasts.  The  dyad  symmetry element  is  contained in 
what has been termed a serum response element (SRE). Recently, a second NGF 
responsive element has been identified which lies immediately downstream of the 
dyad  symmetry  element  (VISVADER  et al.  1988).  This  element  is  capable  of 
conferring NG F responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in the absence of the 
dyad containing SRE, and mediates reporter gene induction in response to serum 
stimulation, in  fibroblasts.  Although  each  of  these  elements  confers  NGF 
responsiveness independently, the presence of both elements does not result in an 
additive c-fos induction. This second NGF and SRE has been termed SRE-II, as 
opposed to the dyad symmetry-containing element now termed SRE-I. 

Another distinct DNA element capable of mediating c-fos  induction is  the 
cAMP  responsive  element  (CRE)  consensus  sequence  present  in  a  variety  of 
eukaryotic genes (COMB et al. 1986; MONTMINY et al. 1986). Like other CREs, the 
c-fos  CRE is  capable of mediating cAMP induction when linked to a  reporter 
gene (SASSONE-CORSI  et al.  1988), however, other regions in the c-fos gene may 
contribute to the cAMP induction of c-fos (FISCH et al. 1989). There are presently 
no  data  suggesting  a  role  for  CREs  in  NGF-mediated  induction  of  c-fos. 
Greenberg and colleagues  (SHENG  et al.  1988)  have  reported  that  the  CRE is 
responsible  for  c-fos  induction  by  Ca + +.  Whether  the  induction  is  due  to  a 
Ca + + -mediated increase in cAMP or to a convergence on a common activating 
protein has not yet been addressed. However, evidence discussed below suggests 
that cAMP-mediated  and  Ca +  + -mediated  induction  of c-fos  do  not  share  a 
common  pathway.  Two  other  regulatory  elements  identified  in  the  upstream 
region  of  c-fos  include  one  which  is  responsive  to  v-sis  conditioned  media 

148

treatment of fibroblasts and another which is an API  binding site (HAYES  et al. 
1987). Neither of these two sites has thus far been implicated in NGF-mediated 
c- fos  induction. 

A host  of agents  which  stimulate  various  second  messenger  pathways  can 
induce  c-fos  in  PC12 cells.  One comparative  analysis  (KRUIJER  et al.  1985)  of 
c-fos induction by NGF, EGF, PMA, K +  depolarization, and cAMP elevation 
pointed  out  one  common  denominator  among  these  agents'  actions,  the 
activation of C-kinase (McTIGUE et al.  1985; CREMINS et al.  1986), and suggested 
that C-kinase may in part mediate c-fos induction by NGF. Consistent with this 
suggestion are the findings indicating that at least one NGF response element in 
the c-fos gene  is  also  a  PMA response element (SRE-I, see  above). 

MORGAN and CURRAN (1986) examined the role of Ca + +  in c-fos induction. 
They found that the K +  depolarization induction of c-fos required the presence 
of extracellular  Ca + +  and  was  blocked  by  dihydropyridines,  suggesting  that 
the  induction  was  mediated  by  Ca +  +  entry  through  voltage  sensitive  Ca +  + 
channels.  A  role  for  calmodulin  was  further  suggested  since  each  of  two 
calmodulin inhibitors, chlopromazine and trifluoperazine, blocked c-fos induc(cid:173)
tion by depolarization. These drugs did not affect c- fos induction by PMA or by 
NGF, suggesting that calmodulin was  not involved in c-fos induction by these 
agents.  Based  on  these  and  other  results,  a  model  for  c-fos  induction  was 
proposed,  (MORGAN  and  CURRAN  1986)  involving  protein  kinase-mediated 
phosphorylation of a transcription activating protein (TAP). This type of protein 
kinase pathway was proposed to mediate c-fos induction by agents such as NGF 
and FGF. 

A recent study from this laboratory (ARMSTRONG and HALEGOUA, unpublished) 
has  used  a  different  approach to examine  the  pathways for  clos induction  by 
NGF. As discussed above, c-fos induction is transient, with transcription as well 
as  RNA  levels  returning  to  near  baseline  within  2 h  after  the  initial  inducing 
stimulus. As with the human monocyte-like U937 cell line (SIDBANUMA et al. 1987), 
PC12 cells are refractory to reinduction of c-fos for up to 24 h depending upon 
the  pathway  used  for  the  initial  induction  (ARMSTRONG  and  HALEGOUA,  un(cid:173)
published).  In PC12 cells,  if clos is  first  induced  by  PMA (via  C-kinase) or by 
depolarization (via Ca + +), reinduction by either of these pathways is not possible 
during the refractory period. However, in the same cells in which c-fos is initially 
induced with PMA or depolarization, reinduction of c-fos is possibly by cAMP 
elevation (via  A-kinase).  Initial induction of c- fos  by  cAMP likewise  does  not 
block  reinduction by PMA or depolarization.  Thus, two  induction groups are 
defined by  these experiments,  one involving either C-kinase or Ca +  +, and one 
involving  cAMP.  Using  this  same  experimental  paradigm  to  delineate  the 
pathways  involved  in  c-fos  induction  by  NGF  yielded  unexpected  results. 
Although  reinduction  of c-fos  by  NGF  was  blocked  by  prior  treatment  with 
NGF, c- fos was reinduced by NGF if cAMP was used as the conditioning agent. 
This result suggests that the cAMP pathway does  not playa significant role in 
NGF-mediated c-fos induction. Initial induction of c-fos by PMA or depolariz(cid:173)
ation significantly but only partly blocked (by  about two-thirds) reinduction by 

Dissecting  the  Mode of Action  of a  Neuronal Growth Factor 

149 

NGF, permitting about one-third the normal level of c-fos induction (about 15-
fold)  to  occur,  even  in  the  A-kinase  deficient  mutant (A26-1B2).  These  results 
suggest that, although NGF shares a pathway for c-fos induction with C-kinase 
and/or Ca + +, another pathway for c-fos induction by NGF exists which is  not 
mediated through C-kinase, Ca +  +, or cAMP. How the two pathways revealed by 
the  c-fos  reinduction  scheme  described  above  relate  to  the  NGF  response 
elements (SRE-I  and SRE-II) in  the c-fos gene  remains to  be  determined.  The 
identity of the novel pathway for c- fos induction by NGF and its relationship to 
the src  and ras components of NGF action may shed further light on the signal 
transduction mechanism for  NGF-induced changes in gene expression. 

Besides  c-fos,  several  other  primary  response  genes  are  induced  by  NGF. 
Two  cDNA  clones,  designated  NGFI-A  (MILBRANDT  1987)  and  NGFI-B 
(MILBRANDT  1988),  were  isolated  by  differential  screening  of a  PC12  library 
generated from  PC12 cells  treated  with  both NGF and cycloheximide for  3 h. 
NGFI-A  and -B fall  into the category of primary response genes  based on the 
characteristics of their induction  by  NGF. They  are  induced  in  a  time  course 
similar to that of c-fos,  and, like c-fos,  NGFI-A is  induced by PMA and by the 
Ca + +  ionophore A23187.  NGFI-A shows overlapping but also distinct charac(cid:173)
teristics with c-fos in the reinduction paradigm discussed above (ARMSTRONG and 
HALEGOUA,  unpublished). 

Among five  cDNA clones identified as representing primary response genes 
for mitogen (PMA)-stimulated fibroblasts (LIM  et al.  1987),  four  were found  to 
represent  primary  response  gene  transcripts  in  PC12  cells  induced  by  NGF, 
EGF, PMA, or K + -mediated depolarization (KUJUBU et al.  1987). Interestingly, 
the fifth gene was not induced by any of these treatments of PC12 cells and thus 
probably  represents  a  cell  type  or  program  (such  as  mitogenesis)  specific 
transcript. This latter result raises the interesting possibility that there may exist 
primary  response  genes  specific  for  the  neuronal  differentiation  pathway 
(KUJUBU  et al.  1987).  In addition  to  the five  primary response genes  described 
above,  a  host  of other  primary  response  gene  transcripts  have  been  similarly 
identified and cloned from fibroblasts (COCHRAN et al.  1983; LAU and NATHANS 
1985),  some  of which  may be expressed in  PC12 cells. 

Several  primary  response  genes  have  been  identified  on  the  basis  of their 
immunological similarity to c-fos (FRANZA  et al.  1987,  1988).  These fos  related 
antigens (fra) are induced with a rapid time course similar to c-fos, although the 
decay of fra  mRNA can be less  rapid. At least a dozen different fras  have been 
identified suggesting the existence of a  fos gene family.  Another immediate early 
gene induced by  NGF is  the proto-oncogene c-jun (Wu et al.  1989).  Again,  the 
time course is rapid, although the level of induction is not as dramatic. A closely 
related gene,jun-B, is  also induced by NGF (BARTEL et al.  1989). In this case the 
kinetics of induction are somewhat slower than that observed for c-jun or c-fos. 
The  rapid kinetics  and magnitude of primary  response gene  induction has 
been  intriguing  with  respect  to  the  potential  role  these  gene  products  play  in 
NGF action. In every case where functionality has been addressed, the result has 
pointed to their role as transcriptional trans-activators. The direct involvement 

150 

S.  Halegoua,  R.  C.  Armstrong, and N. E.  Kremer 

ofthe c- fos gene product in the transcriptional activation ofthe collagenase gene 
(SCHONTHAL  et al.  1988)  and of the preproenkephalin gene  (SONNENBERG  et al. 
1989)  has  been  demonstrated.  Whether  fos  is  acting  as  a  component  of  the 
fosjjun  containing  API  complex  in  these  cases  has  yet  to  be  demonstrated. 
Although a requirement for c- fos expression in NGF-stimulated differentiation 
of PC12 cells has not been established, injection of specific anti-fos antibodies or 
expression of c- fos antisense RNA in fibroblasts inhibits the ability of serum to 
stimulate DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (HoLTet al. 1986; NISHIKURA and 
MURRAY  1987;  RIABOWOL  et al.  1988).  The NGF-stimulated primary response 
genes,  NGFI-A  and  NGFI-B,  have  been  characterized  in  enough  detail  as  to 
suggest a function in transcriptional trans-activation. NGFI-A contains several 
sequence elements which are highly homologous to the DNA binding, zinc finger 
regions  of many  transcriptional  regulatory  proteins  (MILBRANDT  1987).  The 
deduced amino acid sequence of NGFI-B reveals striking homologies to several 
members of the steroid hormone receptor family (MILBRANDT  1988). There are 
two separate regions of homology, one encompasses the ligand binding domain 
and  the  other  encompasses  the  DNA  binding  region  of  the  receptor.  These 
homologies suggest that perhaps the NGFI-B gene product may bind a steroid 
ligand which results in the activation of DNA binding and transcriptional trans(cid:173)
activation. This means of gene trans-activation is obviously different than those 
described above in that it would be dependent upon another hormone which may 
come from  an exogenous source in vivo.  Thus, NGF in this context would  be a 
permissive  agent  for  the  action  of other hormones during  neuronal  differenti(cid:173)
ation. The identification of the putative steroid ligand and the site of its synthesis 
will  shed light  on this  intriguing question. 

Primary response gene products have been suggested to act as "nuclear third 
messengers" in the response of cells to mitogenic, differentiation, or other long(cid:173)
term modulating stimuli (MORGAN  and CURRAN  1989), as outlined in  Fig.  1.  In 
this model, the primary response genes may provide the link between rapid post(cid:173)
translational  events  and  long-term  changes  in  gene  expression.  Within  this 
context, specificity of responses could be provided in part by the precise array of 
TAPs  initially  expressed  in  the  cell  and  the  different  combinatorial  effects  of 
primary response gene products (which may act as heterodimers) on subsequent 
gene expression. To date, a major aspect of this model remains to be tested, that 
primary response  gene  products  cause  changes  in subsequent gene  expression 
which lead to  the changed phenotype (i.e.,  changes which  playa causal role in 
NGF actions). 

4.2  Other Genes 

Subsequent gene  expression  changes,  which  may  in  many cases  depend  upon 
prior  induction  of  primary  response  genes,  generally  depend  upon  ongoing 
protein  synthesis  and  mayor may  not  be  of a  transient  nature.  With  only  a 
fraction thus far identified, it is already apparent that subsequent changes in gene 

Dissecting the Mode of Action  of a  Neuronal Growth  Factor 

151 

expression are quite varied in magnitudes of induction or repression and occur 
over  very  different  time  spans (see  Fig. 4).  Similar in  one  respect  to  NGFI-B, 
several "later" genes have been identified whose products may playa modulatory 
role in NGF action.  One of these  genes,  PC4  (TIRONE  and  SHOOTER  1989),  is 
induced both quickly by NGF in PC12 cells, its RNA reaching a maximal level 
within  2 h,  and  transiently,  with  PC4  RNA  gradually  decreasing  to  baseline 
within  18 h  of NGF treatment.  Sequence analysis  of the  PC4 cDNA indicated 
that  the  predicted  PC4  protein  is  partly  homologous  to  the  mouse  putative 
fJ-interferon  (IFN)  protein and is  highly  homologous  to  rat r-IFN, which  has 
recently been shown to facilitate NGF action in PC12 cells (IMPROTA et al.  1988). 
Interestingly,  PC4 was found  to be expressed in the developing neural  tube at 
times when neuroblasts are dividing and post-mitotic neurons are differentiating. 
The effects ofPC4 protein on PC12 cell differentiation and its role in NGF action 
remains to be determined. One cDNA clone obtained from differential screening 
of cDNA libraries from naive vs long term NGF -treated PC12 cells, clone 63, was 
found  to encode an mRNA which is  maximally induced within  1 day of NGF 
treatment (LEONARD et al.  1987). The cDNA sequence is homologous to calcyclin 
(THOMPSON and ZIFF  1989), a growth regulated Ca +  +  binding protein found in a 
variety of cell types (FERRARI et al.  1987). Two other cDNA sequences, 42A and 
42C  (MASIAKOWSKI  and  SHOOTER  1988),  represent  mRNAs  which  maximally 
accumulate in PC12 cells after 24 h ofNGF treatment and remain high for at least 
7 days of treatment. The encoded proteins are homologous in sequence to each 
other  and  to  the  S-100  family  of Ca +  +  binding  proteins.  The  various  Ca + + 
binding proteins may potentially playa role in the regulation of Ca +  +  or in the 
mediation of Ca + +  effects during NGF -induced differentiation. Another NG F(cid:173)
induced  protein, smg-25a, is  a  novel  GTP binding  protein which  has  recently 
been purified and the cDNA cloned from rat brain (SANO et al. 1989). This protein 
belongs  to  the  family  of ras-like  G-proteins  and  is  expressed  preferentially  in 
brain and in the adrenal medulla. In PC12 cells smg-25a expression is stimulated 
by NGF treatment to maximal levels within 1 day and levels remain high for at 
least  7 days.  The precise function  of this  protein remains to  be  determined. 

Since neurite outgrowth is a hallmark neuronal property, numerous studies of 
gene expression have focused on those genes whose expression is correlated with 
this event. Prominent among such genes are those encoding cytoskeletal filament 
proteins.  The  intermediate  types  filaments  of  PC 12  cells  consist  of  several 
different proteins which are regulated by NGF. As discussed above, analysis of 
protein levels and synthetic rates have shown that NGF increases the synthesis of 
peripherin and of neurofilament subunit proteins. A peripherin cDNA clone was 
originally identified as a clone (clone 73) corresponding to an mRNA which was 
maximally induced in PC12 cells after 2 days of NGF treatment (ALETTA  et al. 
1988b; LEONARD et al.  1988). Sequence analysis of clone 73 (LEONARD et al.  1988) 
and the gene encoding it (THOMPSON  and ZIFF  1989) revealed it to be a type III 
intermediate filament protein (vimentin-like), and in situ hybridization analysis 
revealed a neuronal distribution limited to certain peripheral and central tissues 
(PARYSEK and GOLDMAN 1987; LEONARD et al. 1988). The potential significance of 

152 

S.  HaJegoua,  R. C.  Armstrong, and N. E.  Kremer 

this new neuronal intermediate fIlament protein is intriguing. However, given our 
general  lack  of  understanding  of  the  role  of  intermediate  fIlaments,  the 
assignment of any physiological significance can only be speculative. As discussed 
above, the phosphorylation state as well as the synthesis of the three neurofIla(cid:173)
ment  subunit  proteins  are  differentially  regulated  by  NGF  in  PC12  cells. 
Differential regulation of mRNAs coding for the neurofilament proteins has also 
been observed.  Both NF-L and NF-M mRNAs are increased within 7 days of 
NGF  treatment.  Increased  NF-L  mRNA  was  accompanied  by  increased 
transcription of the gene (DICKSON et al. 1986; LINDENBAUM et al. 1988), while the 
increased levels ofNF-M mRNA were due to both increased gene transcription 
and  metabolic  stability  (LINDENBAUM  et al.  1988).  With  NF-H,  although  the 
protein content was increased, the mRNA content, transcription, and stability 
were  not  found  to  be  affected  by  NGF,  suggesting  control  of the  level  of 
translation or of protein turnover, perhaps resulting from increased phosphoryl(cid:173)
ation (GOLDSTEIN  et al.  1987;  LINDENBAUM  et al.  1987). 

Among the cytoskeletal proteins whose synthetic rates are increased by NGF 
are those involved in the assembly of micro tubules. Production of the structural 
components of micro tubules, <1.- and p-tubulin, increases by about twofold during 
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (DRUBIN et al.  1985; BLACK et al.  1986) due to 
an increased  synthesis  of the  protein (DRUBIN  et al.  1988».  Increased  tubulin 
production  can  be  accounted  for  by  the  twofold  increase  in  its  mRNA 
(FERNYHOUGH and ISHII,  1987; DRUBIN et al. 1988). The expression of MAPs has 
also  been  investigated  extensively.  MAP  1.2  has  been  found  to  be  increased 
during NGF-induced neuritogenesis  (GREENE  et al.  1983;  DRUBIN  et al.  1985). 
The  level  of induction,  initially  complicated  by  concomitant  changes  in  its 
phosphorylation state, has been determined to be about threefold (ALETTA et al. 
1988a) and can be explained by increased synthesis of the protein (DRUBIN et al. 
1988) and the mRNA (LEWIS et al. 1986; ALETTA et al.  1988a). A relatively minor 
MAP species in PC12 cells, MAP 2, detected using specific antibodies, has also 
been found to be induced about twofold by long-term NGF treatment (BLACK 
et al. 1986; BRUGG and MATUS 1988). MAPs 3 and 5 have been found to be more 
dramatically increased, by lO-fold and 15-fold, respectively, after 10 days ofNGF 
treatment (BRUGG and MATUS 1988). The regulation of MAPs 2,3, and 5 have not 
yet been examined with respect to protein synthesis or mRNA levels. The "tau" 
MAPs protein levels,  biosynthesis, and mRNA levels are all induced by NGF 
during neurite  growth (DRUBIN  et al.  1985,  1988),  the potential significance  of 
which will  be discussed in Sect. 5. 

Another  group  of  NGF-induced  proteins  which  may  be  important  for 
neuritogenesis includes the growth associated protein GAP-43 (also termed B-50; 
see SKENE  1989), Thy-l glycoprotein (RICHTER-LANDSBERG et al.  1985; DICKSON 
et al.  1986;  DOHERTY  and  WALSH  1987),  the  so-called  neural  cell  adhesion 
molecule  N-CAM  (PRENTICE  et al.  1987),  the  adhesion-stimulating  p-amyloid 
precursor (ScHUBERTet al. 1989), and the protease transin (MACHIDA et al. 1989). 
For each ofthese proteins both protein and mRNA levels have been shown to be 
increased by NGF in PC12 cells.  Synthesis  of thy-l  is  also increased by  FGF 

Dissecting the  Mode of Action  of a  Neuronal  Growth Factor 

153 

(RYDEL and GREENE  1987). For both thy-1 (DICKSON et al.  1986) and transin the 
induction involves transcriptional regulation, while for  GAP-43  the regulation 
has been suggested to be primarily post-transcriptional (FEDEROFF et al. 1988). By 
contrast, mRNA levels for  NILE were found  to remain unchanged  after NGF 
treatment  perhaps  suggesting  translational  control  (SAJOVIC  et al.  1987).  The 
induction of N-CAM and possibly the f1-amyloid precursor involves differential 
splicing  of  primary  gene  transcripts  resulting  in  the  expression  of  different 
mRNAs and N-CAM forms. The potential significance of these gene expression 
changes to neurite growth will  be discussed in Sect.  5. 

A physiologically important molecule which is induced by NGF is the voltage 
dependent Na +  channel. As discussed above, increases in Na +  channel activity 
result in the establishment of a  Na +  based action potential within 4-7 days of 
NGF  treatment.  A  further  examination  of NGF  induction  of  Na +  channel 
subtypes in PC12 cells was carried out using cDNA clones for type I and type II 
Na +  channels  obtained  from  rat  brain  (COOPERMAN  et al.  1987).  Using  S1 
nuclease  protection  assays,  MANDEL  et al.  (1988)  identified  mRNAs  corres(cid:173)
ponding to type II channels but not type I. The type II mRNA levels were induced 
up to eight fold by NGF treatment of the cells over 7 days, concomitant with the 
increase  in  voltage  dependent  Na +  current.  Thus,  it  appears  likely  that  the 
increased Na + current seen in response to NGF is contributed to at least in part 
by  the  type  II  gene  expression.  It is  not  yet  known  whether  additional  Na + 
channel  subtypes  are  also  regulated  by  NGF,  however,  this  possibility  is 
strengthened  by  the  appearance  of TTX-insensitive  Na +  channels  after  NGF 
treatment (RUDY et al. 1987). Another physiologically relevant activity regulated 
by  NGF  is  that  of  TH.  In  addition  to  the  regulation  of  this  enzyme  by 
phosphorylation,  as  discussed  above,  long-term  increased  production  of  the 
enzyme has been seen in response to NGF in superior cervical gangfIa (THOENEN 
et al.  1971;  MAX  et al.  1978).  In  PC12 cells  the  regulation  appears  to  be  more 
complex.  PC12 cells contain a high basal level  of TH activity,  which  decreases 
after long-term treatment with NGF (GREENE and TISCHLER  1976). Examination 
of the mRNA levels for  TH by Northern blot analysis using cloned TH cDNA 
indicated  that  the  mRNA  is  initially  increased  twofold  within  4 h  of  NGF 
treatment and then gradually declines over the following week (LEONARD  et al. 
1987).  However,  using  a  subclone  of  PC12  cells,  PC12h  (HATANAKA  1981; 
HATANAKA  and  ARIMATSU  1984),  or  an  independent  clonal  isolate  from  the 
original  pheochromocytoma,  PCG2,  which  contained  low  basal  levels  of TH 
expression (GOODMAN and HERSCHMAN  1978), NGF was found over a long time 
to induce TH activity and protein levels,  similar to  what was  seen in superior 
cervical ganglion cultures. 

Several  additional  cDNA  clones  have  been isolated  on  the  basis  of NGF 
inducibility in PC12 cells, using differential screening. The represented mRNAs 
show varied time courses and magnitudes-of induction by NGF. In the case-of one 
such clone, VGF -8 (LEVI et al.  1985), an 80-fold transcriptional induction of the 
mRNA occurs within 9 h of NGF treatment. The 76 kDa protein sequence has 
been deduced from the cDNA, and antibodies have been generated against fusion 

154 

S.  RaJegoua,  R. C.  Armstrong, and N.  E.  Kremer 

products expressed in E.  coli (POSSENTI et al.  1989).  Using these antibodies, the 
protein has been found to be contained in and released from secretory vesicles. 
Whether this protein plays a role in neuronal function and/or the differentiation 
process  remains  to  be  determined.  Another  cDNA  clone,  SCGlO,  which  was 
originally  isolated  by  differential  screening  of  rat  sympathetic  neurons  and 
chromaffm cells, was found to represent an RNA which is induced within a  lO h 
NGF treatment  of PC12  cells  (ANDERSON  and  AXEL  1985).  This  induction  is 
mediated at least in part by transcriptional activation of the SCGlO gene (STEIN 
et al.  1988). One cDNA clone was found to be highly homologous to thymosin 
P-4 (LEPNARD et al.  1987), a protein with a wide tissue distribution. The mRNA 
for this protein is induced up to tenfold, beginning after 12 h ofNGF treatment. 
Although  previously  characterized,  the function  of this  protein remains  to  be 
determined. Several of the cDNA clones which have been isolated on the basis of 
their  representing  sequences  for  RNAs  which  are  induced  by  NGF  do  not 
represent known genes or have as yet not been as well-characterized (LEONARD 
et al.  1987; CRO et al.  1989). Characterization of these and other NGF-induced 
genes yet to be identified is expected to yield insights into the mechanism ofNGF 
action  as  well  as  identify  cellular  components  important  for  the  neuronal 
phenotype. 

Clearly,  expression  of a  wide  variety  of genes  are  regulated  during  NGF(cid:173)
induced differentiation of PC12 cells.  The enormous range  of time courses for 
these events, which have been summarized in Fig. 4, suggests a variety of modes 
of gene regulation. Although the primary response genes appear to be directly 
regulated by second messenger activities rapidly activated in response to NGF, 
the regulation of later gene expression is much less clear. Transcriptional trans(cid:173)
activation  by  primary  response  genes  undoubtedly  plays  a  role  in  later gene 
regulation and evidence for this has been accumulating for some genes such as 
transin (KERR et al.  1988) and SCGlO (STEIN et al.  1988). However, a number of 
genes regulated by NGF show differential regulation by second messengers. For 
example, different genes can be regulated either by C-kinase activation, cAMP 
elevation, Ca + +, or by subsets of these (LEONARD  et al.  1987;  CHO  et al.  1989). 
Elucidation of the pathways for the different gene inductions will  undoubtedly 
unveil  a  complex  interplay  among  second  messenger  systems,  transcriptional 
trans-activators, and modulatory gene products which interact in precise ways 
within a specific time course in order to elicit the proper differentiation process. 
Evidence  for  these  interactions  has  been  emerging  from  studies  of  post(cid:173)
translational  modification  of  regulated  gene  products.  The  c{os  gene,  for 
example,  is  extensively  post-translationally  modified  after  induction  by  NGF 
treatment ofPC12 cells (CURRAN and MORGAN 1986). Similar findings have been 
reviewed  above  for  other  NGF-induced  gene  products  such  as  MAP  1, 
peripherin,  and  TH.  While  such  examples  represent  integration  of  post(cid:173)
translational modification  and gene  regulation in order to  achieve a  common 
goal (e.g.  increased  activity),  they  also  suggest  modulation of induced  protein 
function  over time in order to achieve  a  precise program of differentiation.

5  Neuritic Process Outgrowth 

A dramatic illustration ofNGF action in PC12 cells is the initiation as well as the 
directional  elongation  of  neuritic  processes,  which  requires  the  continual 
presence  of the  growth  factor.  Although  extensively  studied  in  a  variety  of 
neuronal culture systems (see for reviews SMITH 1988; MITcmsoN and KIRSCHNER 
1988), the molecular mechanism for neurite growth is largely unknown. We will 
concentrate on those  PC12 cell  components whose modulation by  NGF may 
underlie neurite growth. 

In a variety of structural and ultrastructural details, the progression of PC12 
neurite  growth closely  resembl~s that of neurons (JACOBS  and STEVENS  1986). 
NGF treatment of PC12 results in the formation of a neurite with longitudinal 
arrays of packed microtubules and some neurofilaments and containing typical 
microfilaments of the cortical membrane and cytoplasm. Characteristic growth 
cones  are  found  at  the  neurite  ends,  although  the  filopodial  structures  are 
typically smaller than those found on cultured peripheral neurons. As the neurite 
grows, new membrane is added at the growth cone. Studies on neurite growth in 
culture have revealed characteristics which have led to two generally opposing 
models for neurite growth. In the first model, both adhesion of the growth cone to 
the  growth  substrate  and  the  tension  generated  along  the  neurite  direct  the 
addition of membrane at the growth cone and determine the directionality of 
growth. This model has been supported by a variety of data (for review see SMITH 
1988; MITcmsoN and KIRSCHNER  1988). Filopodia, with ordered arrays of actin 
and associated myelin containing microfilaments, have also been found to be sites 
of focal  contact  to  the  substratum  (LETOURNEAU  1979,  1981)  suggesting  that 
filopodial structures are the source of adhesion and tension. Later experiments, 
however,  indicated  that  neurites  could  grow  (although  abnormally)  in  the 
absence  of filopodial  movement  which  was  inhibited  by  cytochalasin  (which 
blocks microfilament function) (MARSH and LETOURNEAU 1984) or in the absence 
of a  suitable  adhesive  substrate  (STRASSMAN  et al.  1973).  More  recently,  high 
resolution,  video-enhanced,  contrast-differential,  interference  contrast  micro(cid:173)
scopy was used to examine growth cone movements (GOLDBERG and BURMEISTER 
1986;  ALETTA  and GREENE  1988).  Based  on these  observations,  an alternative 
model  for  neurite  growth  was  proposed  in  which  membrane  addition  at  the 
growth cone occurs in the form  of motile lamellipodia followed  by axoplasmic 
flow in conjunction with modification of substrate attachment by various areas of 
the  growth  cone.  Neurite growth was  thus  proposed  to  occur by  cytoplasmic 
"pushing" from the growth cone rather than by growth cone "pulling". It would 
thus appear that both type of events (pushing and pulling) occur at the growth 
cone  and  must  somehow  be  coordinated  to  control  neurite  growth  under 
different environmental conditions (i.e.  varying substrata). 

NGF  has  been  shown  to  dramatically  influence  neurite  outgrowth  and 
growth cone movements from PC12 and primary neurons. NGF elicits de novo 
neurite  outgrowth from  PC12  cells;  the  elongating neurite  requIres  continual 

156 

S.  Halegoua,  R. C.  Armstrong, and N.  E.  Kremer 

NGF action; and its growth may follow an NGF concentration gradient. These 
effects ofNGF, as with the many other effects discussed above, appear to follow 
the same overall model for NGF action shown in Fig.  1, in which a combination 
of rapid post-translational events  combined with  longer term  gene  expression 
changes lead to changes in both activity and levels of the essential components for 
the  response.  This  is  evident  from  the  long  lag  time  and  transcriptional 
dependence of neurite initiation caused by NGF (see above), the transcriptional 
independence  of neurite regeneration (also  see  above),  and the  rapid effects  of 
NGF on growth cone structure. 

5.1  Adhesion  Molecules and  the  Cell Surface 

The adhesive properties of PC12 cells and the effects of NGF on PC12 adhesion 
have been studied under a variety of culture conditions. PC12 cells will adhere to 
different substrates including tissue culture plastic, polylysine, laminin, fibronec(cid:173)
tin,  and  collagen.  The  attachment  of  PC12  cells  to  each  of these  substrates 
appears to be mediated by members of the integrin family  of matrix receptors. 
For example, anti-integrin antibodies, or peptides corresponding to fibronectin 
binding  sites  to  integrins,  are  able  to  partially  block  PC12  adhesion  and 
profoundly block neurite outgrowth on these substrates (SCHWARZ  et al.  1989; 
TURNER et al.  1989). Several studies have shown that NGF rapidly stimulates the 
substrate  adhesion  of PC12  cells  (SCHUBERT  and  WHITLOCK  1977;  SCHUBERT 
et al.  1978;  CHANDLER  and  HERSCHMAN  1980;  FUJII  et al.  1982;  AKESON  and 
WARREN  1986)  and  changes  surface  properties  of the  cells  (NAOI  et al.  1988), 
suggesting  that  these  changes  are  important  to  NGF-induced  neurite  growth 
(ScHUBERTet al. 1978). However, although NGF stimulates the adhesion ofPC12 
to  the  substrate  within  minutes,  on  a  longer  time  scale  of  days,  the  overall 
adhesion of cells with neurites is diminished. An examination of PC12 adhesion 
sites  on polylysine  and collagen  clarifies  this  apparent discrepancy.  When  the 
adhesion of PC12 cells to the substrate was examined by interference reflection 
microscopy, focal adhesions were found to be limited to the cell periphery, while 
only  close  contacts  were  found  at  internal  regions  (HALEGOUA  1987).  Within 
hours of NGF treatment of these cells,  a  redistribution and pronouncement of 
focal  contact  sites  was  observed  at  protruding  edges  of  the  cell  periphery 
(HALEGOUA  1987).  With longer term  NGF treatment, focal  contacts  remained 
with  the  growth  cone  and  were  rarely  seen  along  the  neurite  or  cell  body 
(HALEGOUA 1987). Thus, as is seen in primary neuron cultures (LETOURNEAU 1979, 
1981),  growth  cones  are  the  major  sites  of  substrate  adhesion  for  neurite 
containing PC12 cells. It is interesting that the integrins are found throughout the 
cell membrane, suggesting that other membrane and/or cytoskeletal components 
are additionally needed for  directing focal  contact formation (see  below). 

Cell  surface  and  secreted  components  of  PC12  cells  have  been  identified 
whose  synthesis  is  stimulated  by  NGF in  a  time  course  consistent  with  their 
proposed involvement in neurite growth. One such substance is a heparan sulfate 

Dissecting the Mode of Action  of a  Neuronal Growth  Factor 

157 

proteoglycan which promotes neurite growth in PC12 cells as well as in various 
primary cultures of peripheral neurons (LANDER et al. 1983). The proteoglycan is 
active when complexed with laminin, and antibodies against the complex can 
block NGF directed neurite growth (Cmu et al. 1986). It has not been determined 
whether NGF stimulates the synthesis of the proteoglycan although changes in 
overall heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans of PC12 cells  resulting from  long(cid:173)
term NGF treatment have been reported (MARGOLIS et al.  1987). The PC12 cell 
surface glycoprotein, NILE, synthesis and glycosylation is  regulated  by  NGF 
treatment ofPC12 cells. This neuron specific protein has also been independently 
determined by several groups to be involved in growth cone-axon and axon-axon 
adhesions (also termed Lt, NG-CAM, G4,  8D9, ASCS4,  69Al) (JESSELL  1988). 
Antibodies  against  NILE block  neurite fasciculation  (STALLCUP  and  BEASLEY 
1985)  and  axon  elongation  along  axons  but  not  along  extracellular  matrix 
(CHANG et al.  1987), suggesting a  role for this protein in both fasciculation and 
elongation. The protein can also provide a suitable substrate for neurite growth 
(LAGENAUR and LEMMON  1987), suggesting a possible role in adhesion. Another 
glycoprotein whose synthesis is stimulated by NGF is thy 1.1 (see above). That it 
may be involved in neurite growth is suggested by its time course of synthesis and 
its ability to provide a suitable substrate for neurite growth (MAKANTHAPPA and 
PATTERSON  1989).  It is  thus  possible  that  thy 1.1  plays  a  general  role  in  the 
adhesive  process.  A  neural  cell  adhesion  molecule,  N-CAM,  has  also  been 
detected in PC12 cells and its synthesis has also been found  to be increased by 
NGF treatment (see above). While this protein may have a variety offunctions in 
cell adhesion during development (RUTISHAUSER and JESSELL 1988), it appears to 
be  involved in neurite fasciculation  as  opposed to neurite  outgrowth (CHANG 
et al.  1987). It should be kept in mind that the increased synthesis of the above 
proteins  in  response  to  NGF may  reflect  a  result  of the  NGF promotion  of 
neuronal differentiation  which  would  include  a  variety  of adhesive  and other 
functions  unrelated to the mechanism of NGF actions. 

5.2  Roles of the  Cytoskeleton 

As  mentioned  above,  the  cytoskeleton  of  the  neurite  is  an  ordered  array 
consisting of linearly packed microtubules and of actin microfilaments packed 
predominantly as a cortical shell beneath the membrane. At the growth cone, the 
assemblies  of these  structures  are  much  more  dynamic.  Actin  or tubulin  are 
continually assembled into short lived polymers and clearly play important roles 
in  determining  the  growth  cone's  protrusive  activities  (recently  reviewed  by 
MrrcmsoN and  KIRSCHNER  1988).  Neurofilaments  can  be  occasionally  found 
along the neurite, but the dynamics of their assembly and relative absence in early 
stages  of growing  neurites  are  inconsistent  with  their  involvement  in  neurite 
growth,  in  spite  of the  NGF stimulated  synthesis  of neurofilament  and other 
intermediate filament  subunit  proteins  (see  above).  However,  these  structures 
may playa role in maintaining the structural integrity of the neurite. 

158 

S.  Halegoua, R. C.  Armstrong, and  N.  E.  Kremer 

While actin filament assembly and movements are likely to be playing a major 
role in protrusive activities at the growth cone, the precise ways in which this is 
accomplished  are  not  presently  understood.  One  attractive  model  for  these 
movements involves monomeric actin and the retrograde  movements of actin 
filaments  presumably  via  interaction  with  type  I  myosin  (MITCHISON  and 
KIRSCHNER 1988; SMITH 1988). Clearly, the tension generated at the growth cone 
would  involve  coordination  of  these  processes  with  those  involved  in  the 
establishment and control offocal adhesion sites (i.e., sites of integrin attachment 
to substrate molecules).  The linkage  between  the integrin  receptors and actin 
filaments  is  mediated  directly  through  proteins  such  as  talin  and  accessory 
molecules such as vinculin (BURRIDGE  et al.  1988). Since establishment of these 
assemblies may be controlled by post-translational events, such as phosphoryl(cid:173)
ation and proteolysis, they represent a potential site for control of neurite growth. 
It is interesting in this regard that NGF treatment has been found to result in 
vinculin  phosphorylation concomitant with  the  redistribution  of vinculin  foci 
and focal  contact sites  preceding neurite  outgrowth in PC12 cells  (HALEGOUA 
1987). This study suggested that NGF-stimulated phosphorylation of proteins, 
such  as  vinculin,  might help  establish  tension  directed  neurite  outgrowth  via 
changes in focal  adhesion sites.  A  variety  of other potential control processes 
have also  been discussed (MITcmsoN and KIRSCHNER  1988). 

Microtubules  of  the  growing  neurite  are  also  in  a  dynamic  state  of 
assembly/disassembly and the control of these processes is essential to neurite 
outgrowth. Although microfilament interactions at focal  contacts may control 
orientation of the growth cone, an initial phase of neurite growth, microtubule 
polymerization  and  stabilization  controls  stabilization  of the  neurite  during 
growth  and  polarization  of the  growing  process  (MITcmsoN  and  KIRSCHNER 
1988).  Microtubule assembly in the growth cone, unlike that along the neurite, 
is in a state of rapid flux, alternating between assembly and disassembly (OKABE 
and  HIROKAWA  1988).  The  stabilization  and  bundling  of polymerized  micro(cid:173)
tubules is essential to neurite growth, as is evident by the block of neurite growth 
caused by microtubule-destabilizing drugs such as colchicine. A variety of MAPs 
such as tau, MAP 1.1 and 2, and several chartins, have been described which may 
in part control  these  functions.  Regulation  of both  the  abundance  and  post(cid:173)
translational processing of MAPs in response to NGF (see above and BLACK and 
KEYSER  1987)  has been proposed to result in the stabilization of microtubules 
essential to neurite growth. Thus NGF may influence microtubule assembly both 
long-term (by  increased gene expression of tubulin and MAPs) and short-term 
(by post-translational modification of MAPs) leading to the establishment and 
elongation of neurites. 

5.3  Regulatory Molecules at the Growth Cone 

Our discussion  of neurite  growth  thus  far  has  been  limited  to  the  structural 
components of the growth cone. However, we have alluded to the fact that NGF 
has various rapid effects at the growth cone and may control structural features of 

Dissecting the Mode of Action  of a  Neuronal Growth Factor 

159 

the growth cone via  post-translational modifications.  This requires  that NGF 
receptors be located at the growth cone. In fact, NGF receptors are preferentially 
located at neuritic growth cones (LEVI et al. 1980) and NGF applied to the neurite 
can influence events at the cell soma. Thus, it would appear likely that the NGF 
transducing  molecules  might  also  be  preferentially  localized  there.  Consistent 
with  this,  the  c-src  tyrosine  kinase  has  been  found  to  be  concentrated  at the 
growth cone (SOBUE  and KANDA  1988).  Whether c-src  plays  any direct role in 
controlling neurite growth or is  simply a signal transducer for  NGF will  await 
identification of the c-src tyrosine kinase substrates. However, it is of interest that 
the location of v-src protein, in PC12 cells transfected and induced to differentiate 
by the v-src gene, appears to be localized at growth cone focal adhesion plaques 
(J. HALEGOUA and S.  HALEGOUA,  unpublished work). Determination of the roles 
of other potential NGF signal transducing molecules such as c-ras should shed 
further light on the mechanics of growth cone control. 

Another regulatory molecule which has received much attention is GAP-43. 
Originally discovered as a protein whose synthesis is well-correlated with axonal 
growth and regeneration (SKENE  1989), this protein is found in neuritic processes 
and is prominent in growth cones of NGF treated PC12 cells (V AN  HOOFF et al. 
1989). Treatment ofPC12 cells with NGF results within 48 h in the redistribution 
of GAP-43  from  cytoplasmic  membranous  structures  to  a  plasma  membrane 
location  especially  associated  with  filopodial  and  other  protrusions.  GAP-43 
expression  is  also  increased  by  NGF by  about  3.5-fold  (see  above).  That this 
protein may play an important role in mediating neurite growth is indicated by its 
ability to elicit filopodial processes in GAP-43 gene transfected Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cells (ZUBER et al. 1989). GAP-43 appears to be intimately involved 
in  second  messenger  regulation.  It is  a  prominent  substrate  for  C-kinase  in 
growth  cone  membranes  (VAN  HOOFF  et al.  1988)  and  is  phosphorylated  in 
response  to  NGF  (K.  MElRl,  personal  communication).  It  has  thus  been 
implicated in feedback regulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover (VAN HOOFF 
et al.  1988). GAP-43 has recently been found to be a calmodulin binding protein 
which binds calmodulin in low Ca + + and releases it in high Ca + +. These unusual 
calmodulin binding properties suggests that it may regulate calmodulin-Ca + + 
interactions (ANDREASEN et al.  1983; CIMLER et al. 1987; SKENE 1989). The precise 
role of GAP-43 in growth cone function, its relationship to other structural and 
regulatory  molecules  in  the  growth  cone,  and  the  potential importance  of its 
regulation by NGF should provide important insights into understanding the 
regulation of neurite growth. 

6  Conclusions 

Studies carried out over the last decade have established a molecular framework 
for  NGF  action  in  PC12  cells.  The  overview  for  this  framework,  depicted  in 
Fig.  1,  has received much experimental support. A variety of second messenger 

160

pathways stimulated in response to NGF have been identified. A number of post(cid:173)
translational  modifications  have  been  described  and  characterized.  In  some 
instances, specific protein kinase activations and protein phosphorylations have 
been shown or been suggested to mediate acute physiologic actions ofNGF such 
as increased neurotransmitter synthesis. Rapid events appear to be continually 
necessary for the ongoing actions ofNGF throughout the differentiation process 
involving also neurite outgrowth. Evidence has also been accumulating for a role 
of  protein  phosphorylation  in  mediating  changes  in  gene  expression.  Such 
changes are essential for long-term NGF actions such as the establishment of the 
action  potential  mechanism  and  the  generation  of neurites.  Insights  into  the 
signal transduction process have also been gained by the observation that proto(cid:173)
oncogenes appear to play essential roles in mediating major actions of NGF. It 
appears likely that the general model for NGF action can be extrapolated to the 
actions of FGF and other neuronal growth factors. 

. 

Although  a  general  framework  for  NGF actions  has  been  established,  this 
framework is lacking in molecular detail and major-issues remain to be resolved. 
For example, the  src  and ras  proto-oncogene products have been identified as 
components  of  the  NGF  signal  transduction  machinery,  but  their  precise 
relationships to the NGF receptor and to each other and to the second messenger 
pathways  to  which  they  may  be  coupled  remain  to  be  determined.  The 
interactions  of the  various  second  messenger  pathways  themselves  have  only 
sketchily been mapped. Evidence for specific molecular events underlying second 
messenger-mediated physiological changes is now only fragmentary and identif(cid:173)
ication of the essential genes for the NGF-differentiation process and their mode 
of regulation  has just begun.  Novel  signal  transduction events  and  additional 
second  messenger  pathway  interactions  which  underlie  NGF  action  almost 
certainly exist and await discovery. 

Studies  on  NGF  action  will  continue  to  feed  into  and  in  turn  be  fed  by 
advances  in  other  related  fields  of study.  Studies  of  the  control  of  cellular 
metabolism, cell shape determination, and the control of normal and malignant 
cell  growth  all  involve  coordinate  regulation  of genes  and  second  messenger 
molecules characteristic of the NGF response. In this regard, it is interesting that 
the  overall  framework  for  NGF-induced  differentiation  strikingly  resembles 
emerging  models  for  neuronal  plasticity (see  for  example  GOELET  et al.  1986). 
Studies  of  the  program  of  NGF-induced  neuronal  differentiation  may  thus 
provide more general insights into growth factor and neurotransmitter modul(cid:173)
ation offunctions in adult neurons. Advances in our understanding ofthese signal 
transduction processes will undoubtedly continue to provide an arena for a new 
set  of exciting studies  over the next decade.
