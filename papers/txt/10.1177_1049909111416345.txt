Abstract

Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been shown to be effective 
not only for its anesthetic properties but also for the analgesic and opiate-sparing effects. 
However, data on efficacy and safety of oral ketamine for the treatment of neuropathic or cancer 
pain syndromes is limited with most of the evidence based on small clinical trials and anecdotal 
experiences. In this review, we will analyze the clinical data on oral ketamine in the palliative care 
setting. After an extensive search using five major databases, a total of 19 relevant articles were 
included. No official clinical guidelines for the use of oral ketamine in this patient population were 
found. Studies on oral ketamine for cancer and neuropathic pain have shown mixed results which 
could be partially due to significant differences in hepatic metabolism. In addition, we will include 
a case report of a 38-year-old female with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with history of chronic, 
severe pain in her fingertips secondary to multiple glomus tumors which evolved into CRPS 
resistant to multiple therapies but responsive to oral ketamine. Based on our experience with oral 
ketamine, this drug should be administered after an intravenous trial to monitor response and side 
effects in patients with an adequate functional status. However, patients in the palliative care and 
hospice setting, especially the one at the end of their lives, may also benefit from oral ketamine 
even if an intravenous trial is not feasible.

Introduction

As the palliative care field continues to grow, it moves further from the initial concept of 
only treating patients with active, progressive, far-advanced diseases at the end of their lives 
to treating patients with chronic medical conditions. This, in turn, presents new challenges 
for palliative care clinicians. Certain pain syndromes such as cancer pain and neuropathic 
pain, either from central or from peripheral etiology, are among the most challenging and 
difficult to effectively treat. Treatment of these conditions more commonly requires high-
dose opiates which may be associated with an increase in significant side effects, which can 
preclude adequate analgesia. The addition of adjuvant therapies in pain management has 
allowed clinicians to treat pain in a multimodal approach, using medications with different 
mechanisms of action, in order to improve efficacy and minimize side effects. Ketamine, an 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been shown to be effective in the 
treatment of opiate-resistant pain syndromes of different etiologies and is being increasingly 
used in the palliative care setting due to its opiate-sparing effects. The efficacy and safety of 
parenteral ketamine for the treatment of these syndromes has been well reviewed.1–3 Oral 
administration of ketamine may be as effective as the parenteral route for treating chronic 
pain in the palliative care population, allowing patients to continue their normal activities 
and adding to quality of life.

Ketamine is a general anesthetic that antagonizes the activity of glutamate on (NMDA) 
receptors.4 When glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor, a nonselective ion channel is 
opened which allows Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the cell and K+ out of the cell. This results in 
increased excitatory synaptic transmission due to the depolarizing effects of ion movement 
along their respective concentration gradients.5–7 Ketamine binds to the phencyclidine 
(PCP) binding site of the NMDA receptor and inhibits excitatory neurotransmission.8 At 
higher doses, ketamine produces general anesthesia. At lower doses, ketamine may inhibit 
the activation of NMDA receptors in secondary afferent neurons, which is thought to be 
essential for increased pain sensitivity (windup) caused by repeated nociceptive 
stimulation.9

When used for anesthesia, ketamine is usually administered intravenously; however, when 
administered at lower doses for pain management, ketamine may be administered orally. 
There are limited data that detail the pharmacokinetics of oral ketamine. When given orally, 
ketamine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver.10 As a result, 
bioavailability of oral ketamine ranges from 16.5% to 24%, depending on the dosage form 
used.10–12 The T1/2 of oral ketamine is reported to be 5.1 to 5.6 hours, which does not differ 
from the T1/2 of ketamine administered intravenously.10 After oral administration, peak 
plasma concentrations are achieved in approximately 30 minutes.13 Ketamine is primarily

metabolized to norketamine by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Norketamine is an active metabolite, 
although it is far less potent than ketamine, and is renally excreted.10,13

Adverse effects are commonly reported after the oral administration of ketamine and are 
frequently severe enough to result in the discontinuation of therapy. Ketamine-associated 
adverse effects are most commonly related to altered function of the central nervous system 
and include vivid dreams or nightmares, anxiety, hallucinations, dizziness, and paranoid 
ideations. Gastrointestinal adverse affects are also associated with oral ketamine use and 
include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain.14 Additionally, there are rare 
case reports of cystitis which is temporally related to the initiation and discontinuation of 
oral ketamine therapy.15,16 Unfortunately, the numbers in the studies investigating the use of 
oral ketamine are currently too small to allow for incidence of these various adverse affects 
to be estimated.

In this article, the authors will review the existing evidence on the use of oral ketamine for 
the treatment of neuropathic pain (central or peripheral) and cancer pain in the palliative 
care population. In addition, 3 case reports of pain are presented from a wide variety of 
medical conditions that have been successfully treated with oral ketamine.

An extensive search was completed using 5 major biomedical databases: PubMed, Embase, 
Scopus, Web of Science, and Biosis, for English-language literature on oral ketamine in the 
palliative care setting. The keywords searched were “oral ketamine,” “palliative care,” 
“cancer pain,” and “neuropathic pain.” A total of 80 articles were found. Inclusion criteria 
were as follows: study performed in patients (adults and children) with medical conditions 
that are routinely seen in a palliative care setting; the indication for ketamine use was 
neuropathic pain or cancer pain; ketamine was administered orally; and, complete 
information about ketamine dosages and pain relief. Case reports and series were also 
included. Exclusion criteria were as follows: review articles; ketamine was administered via 
subcutaneous or intravenous route; indication for treatment was chronic benign pain (ie, 
postoperative, restless leg syndrome, or posttrauma); or study was performed in healthy 
volunteers. A total of 19 articles were relevant for the use of oral ketamine in the palliative 
care setting. In all, 12 articles on neuropathic pain are included—8 case reports, 3 case 
series, and 1 placebo-controlled trial. For cancer pain, a total of 6 articles are included—3 
case reports, 2 randomized controlled trials, and 1 case series. No randomized controlled 
studies were found for the pediatric population.

Cancer Pain

A prospective study conducted by Mercadante et al17 reported significant pain relief when 
sublingual ketamine was added as breakthrough analgesia. Twelve patients with refractory 
pain secondary to advanced cancer, previously treated with different opiate regimens, were 
included in this study. A permanent intrathecal device was placed according to the principal 
pain site. The infusion pump was filled with a combination of morphine, levobupivacaine,

and clonidine, with the latter added only in the presence of a neuropathic pain component. 
The patients were offered either additional intrathecal doses of levobupivacaine 0.25% (1.5 
mg) or sublingual ketamine (25 mg) for breakthrough pain. The patients had been receiving 
a mean of 36 mg of intravenous morphine per episode. Of the 12 patients, 3 received 
sublingual ketamine that was well tolerated over 12 episodes, resulting in adequate pain 
control and was well tolerated. Lauretti et al18 have also analyzed the role of oral ketamine 
as an adjuvant therapy for cancer pain. A total of 60 patients were randomized to a control 
arm (20 mg of oral morphine, 10 mg every 12 hours), nitroglycerin patch (5 mg/d), dipyrone 
group (500 mg, every 6 hours), or oral ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, every 12 hours). Patients 
received initial daily oral morphine dosages of up to 80 to 90 mg/d to keep the visual analog 
scale (VAS) less than 4. After the study drug was introduced, patients were allowed to 
increase their oral morphine daily consumption as needed. Despite a decrease in VAS pain 
scores after the introduction of the study drug, there was no statistical difference among the 
4 groups. However, daily consumption of oral morphine on the control group was 
significantly higher on days 15, 20, and 30 when compared to the oral ketamine group. 
Sedation was also significantly higher on the morphine and dipyrone groups. A second 
double-blind, randomized study conducted by Ishizuka et al19 evaluated the association of 
oral ketamine and morphine in the treatment of cancer pain. A total of 30 patients were 
randomized to a combination of oral morphine (10 mg, every 6 hours) and oral ketamine (10 
mg, every 8 hours) or oral morphine (10 mg, every 6 hours) and placebo. There was no 
statistical difference between both arms in terms of pain relief, number of times that the 
morphine needed to be adjusted, and side effects. Further randomized controlled trials are 
needed to confirm these results.

Oral ketamine can be use in a broad variety of clinical scenarios, from a highly functional 
patient with pain refractory to opiate treatment, to a patient with pain at the end of life. 
Several case studies have reported a significant benefit from subcutaneous and oral ketamine 
infusions for cancer pain at the end of life with a variable dosage ranging from 70 mg/d as 
initial dose up to 3.2 g/d final dose and 30 to 150 mg/d initial dose up to 60 to 375 mg/d 
final dose, respectively.20–23

Neuropathic Pain

The use of oral ketamine as an adjuvant to opiate analgesia in neuropathic pain syndromes 
has received increased interest. Despite the increasing use of oral ketamine for neuropathic 
pain of central or peripheral origin, there are only a limited number of studies and case 
reports which have shown conflicting results. Several case reports have demonstrated 
clinical benefit of oral ketamine in a variety of pain syndromes of central origin such as the 
complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), multiple sclerosis (MS), poststroke pain (PSP), 
and postamputation stump pain (PASP), and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).24–27 The 
majority of patients had previously been treated with various modalities including multidrug 
analgesic regimens and interventional approaches such as spinal cord stimulators and 
epidural steroid injections. In the case of the patient with CRPS, oral ketamine was shown to 
have efficacy but for a short duration.24 The initial dose of oral ketamine was 30 mg every 8 
hours with the highest dose achieved being 60 mg every 6 hours (240 mg/d). There was a 
decrease in the VAS pain score from 10/10 initially to 3 to 4/10 over a period of

approximately 5 months. Nausea and vomiting were the only side effects; these were 
controlled with haloperidol. In a placebo-controlled trial conducted by Furuhashi-Yonaha et 
al,28 8 patients with chronic neuropathic pain of central and peripheral origin including 
CRPS, PHN, and phantom limb pain were randomly assigned to receive oral ketamine (0.5 
mg/kg, every 6 hours) or placebo for a week after an initial trial of intravenous ketamine. 
The severity of pain and allodynia was reduced within 15 minutes of administration lasting 
from 6 to 8 hours. Ketamine plasma levels were undetectable despite good pain relief. In all, 
50% of the patients continued the treatment with oral ketamine (initial dose, 26–136 mg/d) 
for up to 54 months, with a significant reduction in VAS pain scores. No serious adverse 
events were observed.

The effectiveness of oral ketamine has also been studied in a patient with MS having 
paroxysmal and persistent pain and allodynia in the right thoracic region (T5-T8).25 Initially, 
the patient received a trial of intravenous ketamine of 15 mg (0.2 mg/kg) which decreased 
the pain to 0/10, then switched to oral dextromethorphan, an NMDA receptor antagonist, 
which was poorly tolerated due to severe dizziness. Subsequently, oral ketamine was started 
at 20 mg/d, increased to twice a day, and continued for up to a year. There was a significant 
decrease in paroxysmal and persistent pain and allodynia with a decrease in VAS score by 
more than 5 points. The addition of oral keta-mine showed a significant improvement in the 
quality of life with mild dizziness as the only reported side effect. It has also been used in a 
patient with central PSP following an intracerebral hemorrhage.26 The pain was localized in 
the right-hand side of the body and associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia. Oral 
ketamine was used as adjuvant therapy to opiates, tricyclic antidepressants, and 
anticonvulsants. A trial of intravenous ketamine was performed at an initial dose of 7 mg 
(0.1 mg/kg) with partial response, administering a second 14 mg (0.2 mg/kg) bolus after 30 
minutes with a marked reduction in pain, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. Following the 
intravenous trial, the patient was started on oral ketamine 50 mg at bedtime, later titrated to 
50 mg every 8 hours in combination with diazepam 5 mg every 8 hours to prevent the 
psychomimetic effects from ketamine. The patient experienced a significant improvement in 
the pain within 3 weeks of initiating therapy with a remarkable improvement in quality of 
life for up to 9 months. Opiates and anticonvulsants were tapered down and discontinued 
without any evidence of withdrawal or worsening pain. In another case report, a patient with 
PASP experienced adequate pain relief after a trial of intravenous ketamine (loading dose 
0.1 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at 7 μ
Questionnaire scores were reduced from 43 to 2 and VAS scores were 0 at 4, 6, 18, and 24 
hours after the initial intravenous infusion, but the pain returned in 31 hours. The patient was 
treated with oral ketamine at a dose of 50 mg, which provided adequate relief within 10 
minutes and lasted for 6 hours. Subsequently, the patient was placed on an outpatient 
regimen of oral ketamine every 6 hours, which continued to provide adequate pain relief, 
even after 3 months of treatment.

A study conducted by Kannan et al29 evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral ketamine in 
patients with cancer having neuropathic pain. A total of 9 patients previously on opiates, 
anticonvulsants, or combinations of these drugs, and reporting a pain score of 6 or greater 
were included in this study. Oral ketamine was prescribed to all the patients at a dose of 0.5 
mg/kg every 8 hours in addition to their existing analgesic regimen. Of the 9 patients,6 (67%

with diagnosis of head and neck cancer) experienced a decrease in their numerical rating 
score (NRS) of more than 3 within the first 24 hours of starting oral ketamine. The most 
troublesome side effects were drowsiness, anorexia, and vomiting; however, the increase in 
the severity of nausea/vomiting was not statistically significant. Conversely, sedation during 
the first 2 weeks of treatment was reported by 89% of patients. There was no report of 
hallucinations either auditory or visual, vertigo, or restlessness. Fifty-six percent of the 
patients continued treatment with oral ketamine after the study was completed. In a case 
report, a patient with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1-associated myelopathy with 
intractable peripheral neuropathic pain received oral ketamine at a starting dose of 50 mg 
every 8 to 12 hours after an initial trial of intravenous ketamine infusion at 10 mg. The 
patient had significant pain reduction (VAS pain score, 86/100 to 20/100) and no side 
effects.30 Another report of a patient with history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and 
cryoglobulinemia with mixed nociceptive–neuropathic pain secondary to leg ulcerations 
described the benefits of oral ketamine for refractory pain.31 The patient was started on oral 
ketamine as an adjuvant to opiate therapy at 20 mg every 8 hours with improvement on the 
pain from 8/10 to 5/10. Within 4 months, the ketamine was adjusted to 15 mg every 8 hours 
with a subsequent decrease in opiate consumption and excellent pain control. Finally, a 
patient with a unilateral headache secondary to PHN received an intramuscular ketamine 
trial of 15 mg (0.2 mg/kg) for refractory symptoms.32 The pain relief lasted for 2 hours after 
the parenteral dose. A ketamine subcutaneous infusion of 5 mg/ h (0.06 mg/kg per h) was 
then started, which the patient was able to tolerate without any side effects. Subsequently, 
oral ketamine was started at 240 mg/d in 6 divided doses, titrated up to 1000 mg/d in 5 
divided doses. Eventually, the pain resolved within 5 weeks and the patient was able to 
discontinue the ketamine 2 weeks later.

Importantly, numerous other studies have reported more limited benefits from oral ketamine. 
A randomized controlled trial (n = 1) conducted by Haines and Gaines33 determined the 
proportion of patients with chronic neuropathic pain responding to oral ketamine and 
differentiated the true treatment effects from nonspecific effects. A total of 21 patients were 
enrolled in this study. All the patients were submitted to the unblinded part of the study in 
which they were treated with oral ketamine for 1 week at a starting dose of 20 mg/d, titrated 
up to effect or to a maximum daily dose of 100 mg. Fifty-seven percent of the patients 
withdrew from the study due to intolerable side effects or persistent pain. Only 9 patients 
progressed to the n of 1 portion of the study where they were randomized to oral ketamine or 
placebo. There was no difference in therapeutic effect between the ketamine and the placebo 
weeks in 67% of the patients. The presence of intolerable side effects such as 
lightheadedness, dizziness, tiredness, headaches, bad dreams, and a floating feeling was a 
limiting factor that precluded the analgesic benefit of the drug. In a retrospective study, 
Enarson et al34 evaluated the analgesic efficacy and side effects of treatment with oral 
ketamine in patients with central and peripheral chronic neuropathic pain. A total of 21 
patients with refractory pain were included in this study. Oral ketamine was added to their 
analgesic regimens at a starting dose of 100 mg in divided doses titrated to effect with 
median dose of 220 mg/d. In all, 43% of the patients discontinued the medication due to 
intolerable side effects. Thirty-three percent of the patients reported significant pain relief as 
evidenced by lower pain scores and decreased use of breakthrough medications, but only

14% decided to continue the medication for at least a year at daily doses ranging from 100 to 
240 mg. Oral ketamine (maximum dose, 900 mg/d) was not effective in a case report by a 
patient with neuropathic pain secondary to end-stage metastatic adenocarcinoma of the 
cervix at the end of life.35

No official clinical guidelines for the conversion from parenteral to oral ketamine have been 
published. Benitez-Rosario et al23 presented a series of case reports in which an 
equianalgesic ratio of 1:1 was suggested. Four patients with neuropathic pain of different 
etiologies refractory to treatment with opiates and anticonvulsants were transitioned from a 
subcutaneous ketamine infusion (0.1–0.2 mg/kg per h) to oral ketamine (starting dose, 25 
every 8 hours; maximum dose, 150–375 mg/d). These results are not consistent with the 
previous reports which have suggested a conversion ratio of 25% to 50% of parenteral 
dose.22

Pediatric Population

Ketamine, either oral36–38 or intravenous,39,40 has shown to be safe and effective for 
analgesia and sedation during invasive procedures in the pediatric oncology population. 
However, the literature on ketamine as an adjuvant therapy for cancer pain in children is 
limited. Several case reports have described the use of intravenous ketamine as adjuvant 
therapy to opiates, to reduce tolerance in children with cancer pain secondary to 
neuroblastoma,41,42 acute myelogenous leukemia,43 osteosarcoma,43 glioblastoma 
multiforme,44 and peripheral neuroectodermal tumor.45 In all these case reports, intravenous 
ketamine was administered in patients at the end of their lives for intractable pain.

A study conducted by Finkel et al46 described the use of sub-anesthetic doses of intravenous 
ketamine to treat children with uncontrolled cancer pain. A total of 11 children with 
advanced stage cancer and inadequate pain control despite escalation of opiates were 
enrolled in the study. All the patients had shown signs of opiate tolerance and/or intolerable 
side effects from previous analgesic regimen. The starting dose for ketamine was 0.1 to 0.2 
mg/kg per h, and the duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 75 days. Seventy-three percent 
of the patients had a reduction in opiate doses (2 patients with 100% opiate-sparing effect) 
and subjective improvement in analgesic control. Most of the patients were discharged from 
the hospital and observed to be more interactive with parents and caregivers than when 
prescribed high-dose opiates.

There are no studies on the use of oral ketamine as adjuvant analgesic therapy in this patient 
population. To our knowledge, there is only one case study recently published in which oral 
ketamine was used in a 4-year-old patient with metastatic undifferentiated sarcoma with 
involvement of the retroperitoneum, spinal canal, and liver. The patient had been previously 
on morphine (0.2 mg/kg every 3 hours) for 7 months. Oral ketamine was started at an initial 
dose of 3 mg/kg per d in 3 divided doses, as adjuvant treatment. The patient’s pain 
decreased from 8 to 9/10 to 0 to 1/10 on VAS pain score, with a significant reduction in the 
daily morphine requirement. No side effects were reported and the patient was able to 
improve the quality of life for 2 weeks before death.47 The utilization of oral ketamine as 
adjuvant therapy to opiate analgesia could add a potential benefit in pain management in the

conducted to justify approval of new uses of ketamine in these 2 patient populations.

Case Report

We report 3 sequential cases of severe neuropathic pain with positive clinical responses to 
oral ketamine. They span the spectrum of palliative care patients; from an older male with 
sickle cell disease, to a young male with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), to a middle-
aged female with a chronic pain secondary to NF1. Successful pain reduction was achieved 
in an older male who experienced acute pain post nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell 
transplant for sickle cell disease. He had obtained minimal benefit from adequate trials of 
gabapentin, pregabalin, and nortriptyline. His initial dose of oral ketamine was 10 mg every 
12 hours with titration to 20 mg every 6 hours, along with continued long- and short-acting 
opiates. An increase in function was reported, requiring less short-acting opiate due to a 
decrease in pain intensity and being able to rest better at night, which added to his quality of 
life. No bothersome side effects were noted. The second case was a young male with 
relapsed refractory ALL with escalating pain at the end of life. He coincidently discovered 
the pain relief when given intravenous ketamine as a procedural anesthetic. He started at an 
oral dose of 7.5 mg every 8 hours and at the time of death had a dose of 40 mg every 6 hours 
in combination with an intravenous hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia pump and 
steroids.

The main focus of discussion will be the case of a 38-year-old Hispanic female with 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with a history of chronic, severe pain in her fingertips 
secondary to multiple glomus tumors (small but painful benign NF1-associated tumors of 
the glomus body, a thermoregulatory shunt located in the fingertips) which evolved into 
CRPS, resistant to multiple therapies. The molecular pathogenesis and clinical course of this 
patient have been previously reported (participant “NF1-G10” in Brems et al48 and patient 
number “NIH-1” in Stewart et al49). Here, we focus on her response to intravenous and oral 
ketamine.

Briefly, despite 3 surgeries to resect multiple histologically proven glomus tumors from 
multiple fingers, the patient continued to have progressive, severe pain in her right and left 
hands. In addition to NF1, her medical history included migraine headaches as well as neck 
and low back pain of unclear etiology. She had inadequate relief of her hand pain from 
multiple analgesic therapies including steroid injections in the right wrist, anticonvulsants 
(gabapentin and pregabalin), topical analgesic (lidocaine), opiates (hydromorphone and 
oxycodone), and digital nerve blocks. Approximately, 11 months after the third surgery, she 
started methadone (2.5 mg/day) for severe neuropathic pain in her hands and was diagnosed 
with glomus tumor-associated CRPS. In support of this diagnosis, she had previously 
benefited from multiple stellate ganglion blocks, each of which provided 2 to 3 weeks of 
relief.

Given the intractability of CRPS in both hands, she was admitted to the intensive care unit 
of the NIH Clinical Center for a 3-day infusion of continuous low-dose ketamine. Magnetic 
resonance imaging of both hands was performed first to evaluate for tumor recurrence; there

were no changes compared to a previous study on the left hand. A small enhancing lesion in 
the right fourth digit was suspicious for a glomus tumor; however, no surgery was 
performed since this digit was among the least painful. The tip of the left fourth digit was 
visibly swollen, particularly in comparison to the other digits. Table 1 lists the NRS and 
treatment provided during the 72-hour admission. Digital blocks with bupivacaine (0.25%, 
0.5 mL) were administered to her left fourth digit only. No digital blocks were administered 
in the right hand or her painful right great toe so that these could serve as controls. Ketamine 
infusion was started at 0.1 mg/kg per h and continued for 72 consecutive hours. The patient 
was monitored for adverse reactions during the infusion; however, none were reported. She 
developed a migraine headache approximately halfway through the ketamine infusion period 
that was relieved with sumatriptan. Upon discharge, she was instructed to taper methadone 
as tolerated.

Within a week of discharge, the patient reported no pain in both hands at 0/10 (Figure 1). 
The allodynia and hyperalgesia improved dramatically. All the fingers of the patient’s (and 
large right toe) remained essentially pain free for 9 weeks, with the exception of 1 or 2 
spasms per day of unclear etiology in her left third, fourth, and fifth digits, lasting a few 
seconds each, for a total of about 5 consecutive days. Notably, the patient’s frequent 
migraine headaches, neck pain, and low back pain also resolved during this 9-week period. 
She was able to discontinue methadone entirely. Subsequently, her pain returned, ultimately 
escalating to preketamine infusion levels over a period of approximately 6 weeks, again with 
the left hand more painful than the right. She again noted several episodes of numbness and 
paresthesias of both hands. Her right great toe pain, low back pain, and frequent migraine 
headaches also returned.

Due to escalating symptoms, the patient returned to the NIH Clinical Center for a repeat 
ketamine infusion at week 20 (Figure 1). No changes were noted on a repeat MRI of the left 
hand. Prior to the second infusion of ketamine, the patient required 15 mg methadone every 
12 hours and 8 mg hydromor-phone up to 3 times a day as needed. The pads of her left 
fourth and fifth digits were visibly swollen. Bupivacaine blocks (0.25%, 0.5 mL) were 
administered at the base of the left third, fourth, and fifth digits. The ketamine infusion was 
administered at 0.1 mg/kg per h. Bupivacaine digital blocks were repeated once on each of 
the next 2 days as before, for the left fourth and fifth digits only. At the end of 3 days, she 
reported a pain level of 0/10 in both hands and her right great toe (Figure 1 and Table 1). 
She denied any migraine headaches or low back pain. There were no ketamine-associated 
side effects.

As she returned home, she reported pain in her left third, fourth, and fifth digits. This lasted 
for 2 weeks and reached a maximum level of 6/10 before returning to 0/10. Her right hand 
was pain free during this time. Both hands then remained almost completely pain free for 11 
weeks, except for 2 clusters of brief spasms in the third, fourth, and fifth fingers of both 
hands. These followed the same pattern as previously, occurring 1 or 2 times a day over a 
few consecutive days, with each spasm lasting only a few seconds. She continued to have 
migraine headaches but were reduced in frequency to a few times per month from a few 
times per week. The pain in the patient’s left hand then returned abruptly at a reported level 
of 10/10 for a brief period. She resumed taking methadone following this episode. For the

next 7 weeks, she reported consistent pain in her left hand that oscillated between 4/10 and 
8/10. The pain in her right hand was at a daily level of 4 to 5/10 over the same period of 
time. The patient also experienced recurrent pain in her right great toe. This occurred 
intermittently following the second ketamine infusion, lasting a week or more at a time at 
levels ranging from 3/10 to 7/10. Following the return of consistent pain in her fingers, she 
almost daily reported numbness in both hands, especially at nighttime.

She returned again to the NIH Clinical Center for a trial of oral ketamine and bupivacaine 
blocks. An MRI of the left hand showed only postsurgical changes. An MRI of the right foot 
did not show any lesions concerning for glomus tumor. Prior to treatment, the patient was 
taking 10 mg methadone every 8 hours. Immediately prior to initiation of the first 
bupivacaine digital blocks, the patient reported her pain at 7.5/10 in her left hand, 5/10 in her 
right toe, and 4.5/10 in her right hand (Table 1). Bupivacaine blocks were administered at 
the base of her left third, fourth, and fifth digits as previously; a block was also given at the 
base of the nail of her right toe with immediate relief. The intravenous ketamine solution 
was taken orally at an initial dose of 10 mg (10 mg/mL) every 8 hours. As previously, she 
was monitored for side effects, including hallucinations. By the morning following the 
initiation of therapy, the patient reported that the pain in both hands and her right big toe at 
0/10. The patient developed a mild but persistent migraine headache shortly after admission 
for which sumatriptan did not provide adequate relief. She received right-hand side 
preauricular and masseter blocks with bupivacaine on the second and third day with relief of 
her headache. The pain in both hands and her right great toe continued to be at 0/10 for the 
remainder of her inpatient stay. On the last day of her inpatient stay, the patient had a panic 
attack. She denied a prior history of these. Following her return home, the patient reported 
the pain in both hands at 1/10 (Figure 1). She continued oral ketamine therapy at 10 mg 
every 12 hours. She continued to taper her methadone without experiencing an increase in 
her pain level until she stopped taking methadone completely a week and a half after her 
discharge. Over the next few days, however, she noted a gradual increase in pain in both 
hands. Once this reached a level of 2/10, she resumed methadone at 5 mg every 12 hours 
and gradually increased this to 10 mg every 8 hours. The pain in both hands gradually 
decreased to 1/10 over 3 or 4 days. About 5 weeks after her discharge, the patient had 
exhausted the supply of oral ketamine. Two days later, she began to experience spasms in 
the third, fourth, and fifth digits of both hands as before; each spasm lasted a few seconds. 
These spasms occurred for approximately 7 consecutive days before the pain then became 
constant at 3/10 in both hands. As of this writing, we were planning a return visit for her to 
NIH.

Summary and Recommendations

Despite the increasing use of oral ketamine in the palliative care setting, there are limited 
data regarding its efficacy in this patient population which make it more difficult to 
standardize this practice. Few randomized controlled trials have been published on efficacy 
and safety and the majority of the studies are based on anecdotal experience.

In patients with cancer pain, oral ketamine has been used as an adjuvant therapy in a wide 
variety of scenarios from patients with refractory pain syndromes with permanent intrathecal

devices to patients at the end of their lives. Most of the studies have failed to demonstrate 
statistically significant pain relief. However, a study conducted by Lauretti et al18 did show 
a significant decrease in opiate consumption on the ketamine group when compared to oral 
morphine, which is consistent with the previously reported opiate-sparing effect. Other case 
studies have reported some benefit, with doses ranging from 25 mg for breakthrough pain in 
patients with intrathecal analgesic delivery systems, to 30 mg/d (in 3 divided doses), or 0.5 
mg/kg every 12 hours.17–19 Based on the authors’ experience with cancer pain, effective 
analgesia may be achieved at doses of 80 mg/d (in 4 divided doses) in patients with cancer 
pain. In terms of the use of oral ketamine at the end of life, data published in several case 
studies20–23 have suggested a starting dose of 30 to 150 mg/d titrated up to 60 to 375 mg/d 
as final dose which falls within the range that was found to be effective in this setting 
(starting dose 22.5 mg/d, in 3 divided doses, final dose 160 mg/d in 4 divided doses). 
Differences in hepatic metabolism may account for the intraindividual variability. 
Interindividual differences have been also documented in patients with chronic orofacial 
pain as evidenced by lack of analgesic effect in patient with longer pain history.9

Studies of oral ketamine for neuropathic pain have shown mixed results. In case reports of 
patients with various neuropathic pain syndromes of central or peripheral etiologies (eg, 
plexopathy secondary to tumor compression, PHN, or peripheral neuropathy), oral ketamine 
seems to be most effective when used at an initial dose of 0.3 to 0.7 mg/kg per d, titrated up 
to every 6 hours.24–27 In several of these cases, intravenous ketamine (0.1–0.2 mg/kg) was 
given as a trial to assess for efficacy and response, and the patients were later transitioned to 
the oral route due to the short duration of the analgesic effects.

The authors’ experience using intravenous and oral ketamine in a patient with CRPS is 
consistent with the previously published literature. Following the administration of an 
intravenous ketamine infusion at a dose of 0.1 for 72 hours, we twice observed a significant 
reduction in the patient’s pain score (to 0/10) for up to 11 weeks, without the need of a 
loading or test dose. During these pain-free intervals, the patient was also able to discontinue 
methadone, illustrating the opiate-sparing properties of ketamine. We obtained similar 
results with the use of oral ketamine at a much lower conversion rate (5%–15% of the 
parenteral dose) that what has been previously reported.22,23 However, the pain-free interval 
was short-lived (only 2 weeks); a longer lasting analgesic effect may have been achieved 
had a conversion factor closer to 25% been used.

Intolerable adverse effects from oral ketamine are well documented in the literature and 
include sedation, lightheadedness, dizziness, tiredness, increased salivation, vivid dreams, 
dissociative feeling, hallucinations, nightmares, insomnia, among others. Such adverse 
effects have precluded an appropriate assessment of ketamine efficacy in several 
studies.33,34 Side effects are more commonly observed with intravenous rather than oral 
ketamine; this is likely due to the lower plasma concentrations obtained when using the 
latter route. Importantly, some studies have not reported any adverse effects with prolonged 
use of ketamine.28,29

No formal clinical guidelines for the administration of oral ketamine currently exist. Based 
on the review of literature and the authors’ institutional experience, the following steps are

recommended when considering the addition of oral ketamine as adjuvant therapy for 
intractable neuropathic and/or cancer pain:

•

Optimize treatment with opiates and other adjuvant therapies (eg anticonvulsants, 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS]) to minimize side effects before 
starting ketamine.

Strongly recommend a trial with intravenous ketamine infusion before oral administration 
for a faster titration and monitoring of side effects. This should be ideally done in a monitor 
setting such as intensive or palliative care unit.

If the intravenous route if preferred then:

•

•

•

Start intravenous ketamine infusion at 0.1 mg/kg per h, titrate up by 0.1 mg/kg per 
h every 15 minutes as needed until adequate analgesia is achieved or side effects 
occur. Monitor vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate) every 15 
minutes for the first hour, then every 30 minutes for the next 3 hours, and assess for 
pain and symptoms of dysphoria and excessive salivation.

Consider adding benzodiazepine (lorazepam or midazolam) on as needed basis for 
any signs of psychomimetic effects and/or antisialagogue therapy (glycopyrrolate 
and hyoscine) for increased secretions.

Continue intravenous infusion for at least 48 to 72 hours before oral administration.

Convert from intravenous to oral route using at least 15% of the total parenteral dose in up 
to 4 divided dose, having in consideration that the T1/2 of oral ketamine has been reported as 
5.1 to 5.6 hours (eg, 70-kg patient, intravenous ketamine infusion 0.1 mg/kg per h = oral 
ketamine 20 mg every 12 hours).

•

•

After the intravenous infusion, reduce opiate by 25% daily, once adequate 
analgesia has been reached.

Titrate up by 0.3 mg/kg daily until adequate analgesia is achieved or side effects 
occur.

Patients in the palliative care setting, especially ones at the end of their lives, may also 
benefit from a trial of oral ketamine, even if an intravenous trial is not feasible. When using 
the oral route as a first option, monitoring for side effects with frequent pain assessments is 
recommended.

If the oral route is preferred then:

•

Start oral ketamine at doses as low as 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg in up to 4 divided doses per 
day, titrate up by 0.3 mg/kg daily until adequate analgesia is achieved or side 
effects occur.

Future Directions

The best role for oral ketamine in the palliative care setting is uncertain. It remains, at best, a 
third- or fourth-line agent primarily as an opiate-sparing adjunct for patients with intractable 
cancer-related pain or neuropathy. As a prerequisite for more widespread clinical use,

additional randomized controlled trials investigating efficacy and side effect profile of oral 
ketamine are needed. Such studies are predicated on the development of an oral formulation 
for outpatient use. Variations in clinical response and intolerable side effects, especially at 
higher doses, are obvious limiting factors. These are likely related to inter and 
intraindividual variability in drug metabolism and may be conducive to pharmacogenetic 
and pharmacogenomic prediction.

Figure 1. 
Self-reported pain following infusion and oral ketamine. A, First ketamine infusion (0.1 
mg/kg per h for 72 hours) with bupivacaine digital blocks as noted in text; methadone use 
was tapered and ultimately discontinued over the following week. B, Spasms of pain in left 
hand coincided with the unexpected death of a relative. Each spasm lasted a few seconds 
and occurred 2 to 3 times/d. C, New onset intermittent numbness in both hands of 2 to 3 
minutes duration multiple times per day. D, Second ketamine infusion (0.1 mg/kg per h for 
72 hours) with bupivacaine digital blocks as noted in text. E, Spasms of pain in left hand of 
similar duration as previously but unrelated to a plausible trigger. F, Patient described a day 
with the “worst ever pain, 30/10” prompting use of methadone for 3 days without significant 
relief. G, Intermittent numbness in both hands as described previously. H, First trial of oral 
ketamine (10 mg/d) with bupivacaine digital blocks as noted in text; methadone use was 
tapered. I, Methadone discontinued. J. Methadone resumed due to increase in pain.
