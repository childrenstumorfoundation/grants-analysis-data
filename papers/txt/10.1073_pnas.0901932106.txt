Von Recklinghausen neuroﬁbromatosis is a common autosomal dom-
inant genetic disorder characterized by benign and malignant tumors
of neural crest origin. Signiﬁcant progress in understanding the
pathophysiology of this disease has occurred in recent years, largely
aided by the development of relevant animal models. Von Reckling-
hausen neuroﬁbromatosis is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene,
which encodes neuroﬁbromin, a large protein that modulates the
activity of Ras. Here, we describe the identiﬁcation and characteriza-
tion of zebraﬁsh nf1a and nf1b, orthologues of NF1, and show neural
crest and cardiovascular defects resulting from morpholino knock-
down, including vascular and cardiac valvular abnormalities. Devel-
opment of a zebraﬁsh model of von Recklinghausen neuroﬁbroma-
tosis will allow for structure-function analysis and genetic screens in
this tractable vertebrate system.

cardiovascular 兩 neuroﬁbromin

Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) is caused by

mutations in the NF1 gene that result in a wide variety of
symptoms expressed with variable penetrance among affected
individuals (1). NF1 patients inherit a single mutated copy of
NF1 and may acquire additional somatic mutations in the
wild-type allele that contribute to disease progression (2). Cu-
taneous neurofibromas, benign Schwann-cell tumors derived
from the neural crest, are a pathogneumonic lesion of this
disease and often appear in large numbers. More serious onco-
genic lesions, including neurofibrosarcomas and malignant pe-
ripheral nerve sheath tumors, may also develop. Additional
neural crest-related pathologies include pheochromocytomas
and hyperpigmented lesions arising from melanocyte abnormal-
ities known as cafe´-au-lait spots. Non-neural-crest-related ab-
normalities are also common and include cognitive and learning
deficits, skeletal abnormalities, and leukemia. Affected individ-
uals also display an increased incidence of cardiovascular pa-
thologies,
including hypertension, renal artery stenosis, and
congenital heart disease (3).

Neurofibromin, the product of the NF1 gene, is a protein of
⬎2,800 aa. It contains a small region homologous to yeast IRA
proteins that includes a Ras-GTPase-activating domain (GAP)
capable of accelerating the hydrolysis of GTP-bound Ras, thus
down-regulating the activity of Ras proto-oncogenes (4).
Though additional extensive regions of neurofibromin have been
conserved across evolution, other functions of this protein are
largely unknown. Evidence from analysis of the Drosophila NF1
orthologue (5, 6) and mouse models of NF1 (7, 8) implicate a role
for neurofibromin in modulating cAMP-dependent protein ki-
nase A signaling. Unrelated work suggests that neurofibromin
can associate with microtubules (9) as well as other molecules
able to induce cytoskeletal changes (10).

The past 15 years have seen the emergence of increasingly
sophisticated mouse models of NF1 (11–23). Genetic inactiva-
tion of murine Nf1 results in midgestation embryonic lethality
with deficient embryos displaying congenital heart disease in-

volving the cardiac outflow tract and endocardial cushions.
Heterozygous Nf1-deficient mice are viable and fertile, exhibit
learning defects (24, 25), and develop malignancies, albeit at a
low rate over a period of several years. Genetic inactivation of
the p53 tumor suppressor gene augments the disease phenotype
in mouse models of NF1 and leads to a dramatic increase in the
rate of malignancy (14, 15, 26, 27).

Tissue-specific Nf1 gene inactivation using Cre-lox technology
has led to the development of mouse models that more accu-
rately reproduce aspects of the human disease. For example,
Schwann cell-specific inactivation of Nf1 results in the develop-
ment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in all animals
(19, 28). Nf1 inactivation in the developing neural crest using
Pax3- or Wnt1-Cre results uniformly in early neonatal lethality,
with affected animals exhibiting massive overgrowths of periph-
eral nervous tissue, including the dorsal root and sympathetic
ganglia (11, 20). Related investigations have implicated a role for
the heterozygous tumor microenvironment as a major contrib-
utor to the development of disease (19, 28). Tissue-specific
inactivation studies have also identified a critical role for neu-
rofibromin in endothelial cells as Tie2-Cre-mediated Nf1 inac-
tivation reproduces the cardiac abnormalities associated with the
Nf1⫺/⫺ phenotype (11, 20). Nf1 inactivation in blood leads to the
development of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML),
the specific form of leukemia found in NF1 patients (29–31). Nf1
function in mast cells and neurofibromin-mediated modulation
of Ras/Erk signaling downstream of c-Kit have also been impli-
cated in tumor progression (32).

Though mouse and Drosophila models of NF1 have proven to
be informative, additional information will be obtained from
alternative model systems. In particular, vertebrate models that
allow for high-throughput in vivo screens and rapid, cost-
effective phenotypic analysis may facilitate discovery of novel
functions and therapeutic approaches. Hence, we sought to
develop a zebrafish model of NF1 and to use this model system
to elucidate novel developmental functions of neurofibromin.
Here, we describe two closely related zebrafish orthologues: nf1a
and nf1b. Transient knockdown of either gene, or both together,
during embryogenesis results in developmental defects of car-
diac and neural crest structures that closely resemble murine
models and aspects of the human disease. In addition, we identify

Results
Identification of nf1a and nf1b. We used a bioinformatics approach
to identify the zebrafish orthologues of human NF1. Analysis of the
eighth assembly (Zv8) of the zebrafish genome revealed two genes
highly similar to NF1 at the amino acid level (90.4% and 90.7%,
respectively), which we named nf1a and nf1b. These genes are highly
related to one another (87.4% identical and 93.7% similar), with
nf1a and nf1b sharing similar genomic structures and each contain-
ing 57 exons (Fig. 1 A and B). nf1a is located on chromosome 15
(Fig. 1A) and predicts a 311-kDa protein composed of 2,755 aa,
whereas nf1b is located on chromosome 10 (Fig. 1B) and predicts
a 310-kDa protein composed of 2,747 aa.

Comparison to Drosophila, murine, and human neurofibro-
min protein sequences reveals significant conservation in the
GAP and IRA homology domains and also in extensive areas
flanking these regions, suggesting additional functional motifs
that have been conserved across evolution (Fig. S1). A phylo-
genetic tree (Fig. 1C) shows a tight clustering of the zebrafish
neurofibromin orthologues with other mammalian neurofibro-
mins and a divergence from the Drosophila neurofibromin
orthologue. Human/zebrafish synteny maps and bioinformatics
analyses suggest that nf1a and nf1b likely arose via gene dupli-
cation (Fig. 1D). Upstream of the human NF1 gene on chromo-
some 17 are genes encoding WD repeat and SOCS box-
containing 1 (WSB1), kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), and
Galectin-9 (LGALS9), whereas A kinase anchor protein 1
(AKAP1) and RNA-binding protein Musashi homolog 2 (MSI2)
both lie downstream of NF1. Similar genes flank nf1a, whereas
nf1b is flanked only by orthologues of KSR1 and MSI2. The
identification of duplicated genes is common in zebrafish and
reflects the well-described chromosomal doubling event occur-
ring early in teleost evolution (33).

The GenBank EST database identified expressed sequence
tags for both zebrafish nf1 genes in many tissues, including the
heart (Fig. S2 A and Tables S1 and S2), suggesting that neither
gene is likely to be a pseudogene and that they are expressed in
overlapping tissues. We examined the expression of both genes
by whole-mount in situ hybridization between the four-cell stage
and 4 days postfertilization (dpf) and found that both genes are
expressed ubiquitously during early development with later
restriction to regions of the head and anterior central nervous

system (Fig. 2 A1–A7 and B1–B7, and Fig. S2 C1–C7 and
D1–D7). Notably, at 48 h postfertilization (hpf) and 3 dpf, both
genes are expressed in the heart (Fig. 2 A4, B4, A6, and B6, and
Fig. S2 C5, C6, D5, and D6) and in the dorsal vessel (Fig. 2 A3,
B3, A5, and B5, and Fig. S2 C7 and D7). RT-PCR using RNA

and nf1b at the four-cell stage, 24 hpf, 48 hpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf. (A1 and B1)
At the four-cell stage, nf1a and nf1b are expressed throughout the animal
pole of the developing embryo. (A2 and B2) Both genes are expressed broadly
at 24 hpf (Inset), with strong expression along the spinal cord. (A3 and B3) At
48 hpf, expression of nf1a and nf1b is noted in the head and regions of the
anterior trunk (Inset). Spinal cord expression of both genes persists, and
positive staining is observed along the dorsal vessel for nf1a and nf1b. (A4 and
B4) Cardiac expression for both genes is observed at 48 hpf. (A5 and B5)
Expression of nf1a and nf1b become progressively restricted to regions of the
head at 3 dpf (Insets). nf1a and nf1b expression along the dorsal vessel (A5 and
B5) and in the embryonic heart (A6 and B6) persist at 3 dpf. (A7 and B7) At 4
dpf, robust vascular staining is apparent for nf1a and nf1b. (Scale bars: 25 ␮m;

pression, particularly in the vascular endothelium (Fig. S2 B–G),
whereas RNA from one-cell embryos indicate that both genes
are expressed maternally (Fig. S2B). Queries of an expression
database generated from sorted endothelial cells from
Tg(fli1:egfp)y1 zebrafish identifies nf1a and nf1b in both GFP⫹
and GFP⫺ cell populations, consistent with the expression of
these genes in vascular endothelium (34).

Morpholino Knockdown of nf1a and nf1b. We used morpholino
antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) to inhibit expression of nf1a
and nf1b at early stages of development. Effectiveness of gene
knockdown by translation blocking MO was confirmed by West-
ern blot analysis (Fig. S3A). The ability of neurofibromin to
function as a Ras-GAP, thereby down-regulating levels of active
GTP-bound Ras, can result in decreased phosphorylation of
downstream effectors, including Erk/MAPK. Western blots of
3.5-dpf whole-embryo extracts derived from nf1a, nf1b, or nf1a/
nf1b morphants revealed a marked up-regulation of phospho-
Erk in knockdown tissue, whereas levels of total Erk were
unchanged (Fig. S3B). Efficacy of splice-blocking MOs was
assessed by RT- and quantitative PCR using RNA collected from
24-hpf embryos (Fig. S3 C–G).

The phenotypes produced by MO treatment were compared
in a blinded fashion to embryos injected with control MOs. We
observed a marked increase in the intensity and domain of
expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of
Schwann and glial cells, by whole-mount in situ hybridization
(Fig. S4). This finding is consistent with the increase in neural
crest-derived tissue in Nf1⫺/⫺ mice and the presence of neural
crest-derived tumors in NF1 patients. We also examined the
expression of myelin basic protein (mbp), sex-determining region
Y-box 10 (sox10), forkhead box d3 ( foxd3), and crestin, but did
not observe changes. Therefore, the alterations observed in nf1a
and nf1b morphant embryos appear to be restricted to the
Schwann-glial lineages in the neural compartment.

Morpholino Knockdown of nf1a and nf1b Results in Cardiovascular
Defects. nf1a and nf1b morphant embryos displayed gross ab-
normalities of cardiovascular development appreciable to the
blinded observer by 48 hpf. Frequently, blood was seen to move
back and forth from atrium to ventricle in morphants, suggesting
a malfunctioning atrioventricular valve (Movies S1 and S2). At
the resolution afforded to us by histological analysis, we ob-

served no readily apparent structural defects in the atrioven-
tricular valves of morphants despite the observed functional
deficits (Fig. S5). In addition, we observed pooling of blood in
the common cardinal vein and a paucity of blood flow along the
dorsal aorta and posterior cardinal vein. Valvular insufficiency
and reduced blood flow were not seen in control morphants or
wild-type embryos (Movie S3). Overall development of the
embryos was relatively preserved through the first 3 days despite
these cardiac defects. Histological analysis revealed a thinned
ventricular myocardium and large pericardial effusions in MO-
treated embryos (Fig. 3 K and L, and Fig. S6 A, B, F, and G).
Immunohistochemical analysis of 3.5-dpf nf1a, nf1b, and nf1a/
nf1b morphant zebrafish also reveals increases in phospho-Erk
staining (Fig. 3 M and N, and Fig. S6 C–E and H–K). Gross
morphological analysis showed an increased incidence of peri-
cardial effusions beginning at 48 hpf, reflecting cardiac dysfunc-
tion, in nf1a and nf1b morhpants when compared with controls
(Fig. 3 A–G, and Fig. S6 L and M). Nonspecific toxicity arising
from MO exposure as a cause of the observed cardiovascular
defects was unlikely because unrelated control or scrambled
MOs failed to produce similar levels of abnormalities, defects
were observed even at low doses of specific MOs, and similar
defects were observed with several unrelated but specific MOs
directed against nf1a and nf1b. In addition, injection of specific
MOs in p53 mutant embryos also produced similar cardiovas-
cular defects (Fig. 3 H–J), and off-target effects due to MO
exposure are known to be partially mediated through p53
activation (35). Defects in cardiac valve morphogenesis and a
thinning of the ventricular myocardium are also seen in Nf1⫺/⫺
murine embryos.

We performed knockdown experiments using zebrafish em-
bryos in which endothelial cells are marked by expression of a
cytoplasmic enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) to allow
for a more detailed analysis of vascular development. Dramatic
abnormalities of vascular patterning in the intersomitic vessels of
morphant embryos were seen at 48 and 72 hpf (Fig. 4). In nf1a
MO-treated embryos, the leading edge of the sprouting vessels
displayed claw-like projections at 48 hpf (Fig. 4C) and failed to
pattern normally such that the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic
vessel (DLAV) did not form or developed in a rudimentary
fashion (Fig. 4F). This occurred in embryos that were otherwise
normal in overall size and maturity. These defects were also
noted in nf1a/nf1b compound morphants, and were present but

and 72 hpf. (A–C) At 48 hpf, nf1a ATG MO-treated Tg(ﬂi:egfp)y1 (endothelial-
speciﬁc GFP transgenic) zebraﬁsh embryos display gross defects in vascular
development compared with control MO-treated or uninjected samples. Mor-
phant embryos (C) display abnormal claw-like projections at the leading edge
of the developing intersomitic vessels and fail to develop the dorsal longitu-
dinal anastomotic vessel (DLAV) present in both control MO-treated (B) and
uninjected (A) samples. (D–F) At 72 hpf, nf1a ATG morphant embryos display
only rudimentary DLAVs and a general disorganization of the trunk vascula-
ture (F) when compared with control MO-treated (E) or uninjected (D) em-
bryos. (Scale bars: 25 ␮m.)

less severe in nf1b morphants. Vascular patterning defects did
not appear to correlate directly with cardiac defects, as we
observed embryos with vascular abnormalities that did not
display pericardial effusion or valvular insufficiency as assessed
by a to-and-fro movement of blood within the heart (36). Blood
flow within the dorsal aorta and posterior cardinal vein appeared
intact in these embryos (Movie S4).

At 24 hpf, analysis using zebrafish embryos expressing a
nuclear-localized GFP in endothelial cells indicated that mor-
phants displayed a complete (Fig. 5A4) or partial absence of
intersomitic vessels emanating from the dorsal aorta when
compared with stage-matched controls (Fig. 5A3). Overall mor-
phology of morphant and control embryos appeared equivalent
(Fig. 5 A1 and A2), ruling out nonspecific developmental delay.
These defects were apparent following MO-mediated knock-
down of nf1a or nf1b, whereas knockdown of both together had
an additive effect (Fig. 5B). The small percentage of embryos
with defects produced by the 5MP MO may have been due to
low-level knockdown of nf1a. Again, similar defects were ob-
served with several unrelated but specific MOs directed against
nf1a and nf1b (Fig. S7A). Our analysis of morphant embryos at
24 hpf also revealed a caudal vessel defect. Morphant embryos
displayed a cystic expansion in the region of the caudal vein and
exhibited inappropriate anastomoses between the caudal vein
and artery (Fig. S7 D2–D4 and Movie S5) when compared with
controls (Fig. S7D1). Identity of the expanded tissue as vascular
was confirmed by expression of GFP (Fig. S7 D6–D8) and the
observation of a pooling of red blood cells in the expanded
region (Movie S5). This defect was present following knockdown
of nf1a, nf1b, or both together (Fig. S7 C and D).

Additional confirmation of the role of nf1a/nf1b in vascular
development derives from studies using a genetic background
sensitized to vascular insult. Previous studies used MOs directed
against flt4, the zebrafish VEGF receptor-3 orthologue, to
investigate genetic interactions during zebrafish artery develop-
ment (37). Additionally, flt4 morphant zebrafish embryos display
variable defects in segmental artery formation reminiscent of
those identified in our nf1a/nf1b morphants. Endothelial-GFP
expressing zebrafish embryos were injected with flt4 MO alone
and in combination with a MO directed against nf1a, nf1b, or a
combination of both. At low MO doses, 85% of flt4/nf1a, 24% of
flt4/nf1b, and 36% of flt4/nf1a ⫹ nf1b compound morphants
displayed abnormal vascular shunts at 48 hpf compared with only
3–8% of individual flt4, nf1a, or nf1b morphants (Fig. 5C, Fig.

gross morphological analysis at 24 hpf. (Scale bars: 500 ␮m.) Development of
intersomitic vessels is deﬁcient at 24 hpf in nf1a/nf1b combined morphants

background for the detection of vascular defects, was combined with nf1a,

(Movie S7). The shunts occur between the dorsal aorta and the
dorsal
longitudinal anastomotic vessel with retrograde flow
through segmental arteries back into the dorsal aorta or through
intersegmental veins into the posterior cardinal vein. In some
cases, there were interruptions of the dorsal aorta.

Vascular Patterning Defects in Mouse Embryos Lacking Nf1. Although
cardiac defects have been reported in mouse embryos lacking
Nf1, a phenotype that has been attributed to a role for neuro-
fibromin in endothelium (11), abnormalities in vascular pattern-
ing have not been previously identified. Nf1⫺/⫺ mice succumb
during midgestation and exhibit significant peripheral hemor-
rhage that has been hypothesized to be secondary to the
intracardiac defects, although similar hemorrhage is not a com-
mon feature of mouse embryos with congenital heart disease. In
light of our observation of peripheral vascular patterning defects
in nf1 morphant zebrafish embryos, we reevaluated murine Nf1
knockouts by whole-mount platelet/endothelial cell adhesion
molecule-1 (PECAM-1) staining to visualize endothelium at
E10.5–E11.5 time points before the development of overt cardiac
failure or significant endocardial cushion defects. Although no

Nf1⫺/⫺ mice die during midgestation as a result of severe
cardiac failure, and display gross cardiovascular and neural crest
defects. Closer examination of these Nf1-defcient mice reveals
hyperproliferative endocardial cushions, the precursors of the
cardiac valves, which have been shown to result from a cell-
autonomous role for Nf1 in endothelial cells (11). Here, we show
that zebrafish embryos also display cardiovascular and neural
abnormalities following transient knockdown of the orthologous
nf1 genes. These defects resemble those seen in mouse models,
including the presence of pericardial effusions, thinned myocar-
dium, abnormal cardiac valves, and an increase in Schwann-glial
derivatives.

Importantly, the generation of a new vertebrate model of NF1
allowed us to identify a previously unrecognized role for neu-
rofibromin in vascular patterning during early zebrafish and
murine development. The ability to distinguish a primary vas-
cular defect from a phenotype resulting secondary to cardiac
failure is possible in zebrafish because early vascular develop-
ment does not require an intact circulation, and adequate
oxygenation is achieved via passive diffusion (38). In mice, this
distinction is much more difficult to define, emphasizing one of
the advantages of developing a zebrafish model of NF1. It is
worth noting that the degree of peripheral hemorrhage noted in
Nf1 knockout embryos is unusual for mouse models of congen-
ital heart disease and is not seen in embryos with double-outlet
right ventricle, truncus arteriosus, or atrioventricular canal de-
fects despite pericardial effusions indicating heart failure (39).
We hypothesize that a peripheral vascular defect produced by
endothelial dysfunction in Nf1-deficient mouse embryos ac-
counts for the observed degree of hemorrhage. Though the
complexity and severity of vascular patterning defects in mouse
and zebrafish embryos lacking neurofibromin are distinct, we
suggest that they are highly likely to be related, and there is
precedent for similar differences in the vascular manifestation of
genetic mutations in fish and mice (40, 41).

Vascular patterning defects represent a well-recognized com-
ponent of the pleiotropic spectrum of NF1 disease phenotypes
in affected individuals (3). NF1 patients often exhibit a charac-
teristic vascular lesion known as moyamoya, a name that derives
from its appearance as a puff of smoke on computed tomography
scans of the head due to abnormal small-vessel patterning in the
brain (42, 43). Other vascular defects, including hypertension
and renal artery stenosis, have also been documented (3).
Neurofibromin has been shown to modulate the activity of Ras
proto-oncogenes through its GAP-related domain (GRD), and
multiple lines of evidence support a role for Ras signaling in
normal vascular patterning and development. For example,
mouse embryos deficient for p120 GAP activity display vascular
defects such as abnormalities in endothelial cell organization
(44). In addition, mutations in RASA1, the gene encoding p120
GAP, are associated with vascular anomalies in affected indi-
viduals (45, 46). Experiments in chicken and mouse endothelial
tissues have identified a role for H-Ras in angiogenesis and
vascular permeability (47). Studies in zebrafish also support a
role for Ras signaling in vascular development; MO knockdown
of k-ras or overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of k-ras
both result in defective vascular development (48). These data,
taken together with our own, suggest a necessity for tight
regulation of Ras signaling in normal vascular development. The
flt4/(nf1a, nf1b, nf1a ⫹ nf1b) vascular shunting phenotype rep-
resents an inappropriate arteriovenous malformation, which is
also present in the embryos with cystic expansion of the dorsal
vein. Other vascular patterning defects observed in the nf1a/nf1b
morphants may represent distinct functions of neurofibromin in
the vasculature, or may be related by common underlying
mechanisms. The genetic interaction between nf1a/nf1b and flt4
that we show suggests that these molecules may function in a

Fig. 6. Nf1⫺/⫺ mouse embryos display defects in vascular patterning. (A and
C) Whole-mount PECAM-1 staining of E10.5 wild-type (A) and Nf1⫺/⫺ (C)
mouse embryos reveals abnormal vascular patterning in Nf1⫺/⫺ embryos, with
an increased number of vessels and branching (dots at branch points) partic-
ularly evident in the somites (between dashed lines). Low-magniﬁcation insets
show an overall increase in vascular staining in Nf1⫺/⫺ embryos. (E) Quantiﬁ-
cation of vessel branch points over four somites immediately rostral to the
anterior limb buds at E10.5 shows a signiﬁcant increase in Nf1⫹/⫺ and Nf1⫺/⫺
embryos compared with wild type (⫾SD). (B and D) Similar staining of stage-
matched littermates at E11.5 reveals loss of the normal avascular zone around
the developing eye (D) in Nf1⫺/⫺ embryos compared with wild type (B). (F)
Quantiﬁcation of abnormal eye vasculature shows a signiﬁcant increase in the
number of affected Nf1⫺/⫺ embryos compared with wild types (P ⬍ 0.004).

overt differences were appreciated in E11.5 yolk sacs (Fig. S8),
we identified vascular abnormalities in embryos, including an
increase in overall vascularity and a failure of the primitive
vascular plexuses in the somitic region and head to remodel as
seen in wild-type embryos (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that
peripheral hemorrhage commonly noted on Nf1⫺/⫺ mouse em-
bryos may be related to an intrinsic vascular defect similar to that
identified in MO knockdown zebrafish.

Discussion
We report the identification and initial characterization of the
zebrafish orthologues of the human neurofibromatosis gene
NF1. The two zebrafish nf1 genes likely arose from a genome
duplication event and are highly related to one another in
structure, sequence, and expression pattern through early de-
velopment. MO-mediated knockdown of either gene alone
results in developmental defects involving cardiac and neural
crest structures that are even more prominent when both genes
are knocked down in concert, suggesting partial functional
redundancy. Interestingly, the entire spectrum of cardiovascular
defects we have identified, including pericardial effusions and
functional valve abnormalities, segmental vessel defects, and
aberrant arteriovenous shunts, are greater with knockdown of
the nf1a orthologue compared with nf1b, suggesting that nf1a
may play a more prominent role in cardiovascular development.

common molecular pathway, although alternative interpreta-
tions cannot be ruled out.

In an effort to determine the degree to which neurofibromin
function can be ascribed to its activity as a Ras-GAP, we have
previously generated a mouse model
in which the isolated
neurofibromin GRD is expressed in a tissue-restricted manner
upon Cre-mediated activation (20). These studies have shown
that reconstitution of the neurofibromin GRD in endothelial
cells of Nf1⫺/⫺ mice is sufficient to rescue cardiac development
and midgestational lethality. The resulting mice, however, are
abnormal and succumb in the early postnatal period. Analysis of
these animals reveals massive overgrowth of peripheral nervous
tissues that mimic those of the neural crest-specific Nf1-deleted
mice. This finding strongly suggests that additional domains
outside the GRD are important for neural crest growth and
homeostasis. Our development of a zebrafish model of NF1 will
be particularly useful for examining the potential activities of
these domains through in vivo structure-function analyses. En-
hancer and suppressor screens may identify signaling pathways,
in addition to the Ras/MAPK and mTOR pathways, that impact
disease progression. In addition, high-throughput small-
molecule screens will allow for the rapid identification of com-
pounds with the potential for modifying NF1 disease pheno-
types. The generation of stable mutant lines for nf1a and nf1b

serve as a necessary prerequisite to pursue these exciting pos-
sibilities.

Materials and Methods

ing to nf1a, nf1b, ﬂt4, and associated controls were dissolved in water and
