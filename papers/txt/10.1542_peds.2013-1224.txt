Sirolimus Improves Pain in NF1 Patients With Severe
Plexiform Neuroﬁbromas

abstract

Plexiform neuroﬁbromas (PNs) are common and potentially debilitating
complications of neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1). These benign nerve-sheath
tumors are associated with signiﬁcant pain and morbidity because
they compress vital structures. The mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway is a major mediator involved in tumor growth in
NF1. We present 3 cases of patients with NF1, aged 8, 16, and 17 years,
followed for inoperable and symptomatic PNs; patients received sirolimus
for life-threatening and painful neuroﬁbromas after multidisciplinary
consultation. Epidemiologic, clinical, and radiologic data were retro-
spectively collected. The volume of PNs did not differ between baseline
and 12-month follow-up and pain was alleviated, with withdrawal of
analgesics in 2 cases at 6 months, and signiﬁcantly decreased for
the third case. Sirolimus for inoperable symptomatic PNs in patients
with NF1 permitted stabilization of mass and produced unpredictable
and important alleviation of pain in all cases with good tolerance. This
treatment was proposed in extreme cases, in absence of therapeutic
alternatives, after multidisciplinary consensus. The mTOR pathway may
be both a major mediator of NF1 tumor growth and regulator of noci-
ceptor sensitivity. mTOR inhibitors clinically used as anticancer and
immunosuppressant drugs could be a potential treatment of chronic
pain. Pediatrics 2014;133:e1792–e1797

Neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1) is one of the
most common autosomal dominant
disorders, with an incidence of 1 in 2500
to 3000 births.1 The NF1 gene encodes
for a tumor suppressor protein, neu-
roﬁbromin. This protein can down-
regulate cell growth by inhibiting the
Ras proto-oncogene.2,3 Mutation of this
gene in NF1 is associated with in-
creased risk of developing tumors.4
Over the past 10 years, signiﬁcant
advances have been made in under-
standing NF1 molecular mechanisms
underlying speciﬁc disease complica-
tions. New pharmacological approaches
have been developed to target signaling
pathways, such as Ras, angiogenesis,
growth factors, mast cell proliferation,
and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), all involved in NF1.5–7 mTOR is
a serine/threonine kinase that is fre-
quently hyperactivated in cancer, which
promotes tumor progression.8 Recent
studies showed that neuroﬁbromin Ras-
mediated regulation of growth operates
through the mTOR pathway.9,10 The iden-
tiﬁcation of mTOR as a major mediator of
NF1 tumor growth has led to clinical trials
of mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus.11,12
Patients with NF1 are at increased risk
of developing tumors of the central and
peripheral nervous system, including
plexiform neuroﬁbromas (PNs).13 These
benign nerve-sheath tumors are as-
sociated with signiﬁcant morbidity,
mortality, and decreased quality of life
because of disﬁgurement, compression
of vital structures, and often-unremitting
pain. Surgery is the only standard treat-
ment. However, given the location, in-
ﬁltrative nature, high vascularity, and
size of PNs, complete resection is often
not feasible. In this report, we present
3 cases of young patients with NF1 who
received sirolimus for life-threatening
PN as compassionate use.

CASE REPORTS

All 3 patients met the diagnostic criteria
for NF1 established at the National

Institutes of Health Consensus Develop-
ment Conference.4 PNs could not be
surgically removed because of their
location and proximity to vital body
structures. Because of lack of other
treatment options, patients were treated
with sirolimus to shrink growth of
PNs, after a multidisciplinary staff
reviewed their cases. Data were retro-
spectively collected and analyzed. Eval-
uation of the response to sirolimus
therapy was based retrospectively on
a 1-year morphologic study of PN with 3-
dimensional MRI analysis by using ﬁeld
strength of 1.5 T, T1- and T2-weighted,
and on reduction in pain level. Patients
1 and 2 were evaluated each month
during the ﬁrst 3 months and then every
3 months by a dermatologist and a pain
specialist by using a numerical rating
scale (NRS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the
worst pain imaginable). Patient 3 was
evaluated each month by an oncologist
and pain was assessed by using the
faces rating scale.

PATIENT 1

A 17-year-old adolescent boy with spo-
radic NF1 was followed for an extensive
PN. The lesion measured 20 3 13 cm on
MRI in July 2009 and extended from the
true pelvis to porta renis to anterior
sacral foramina (Fig 1). This inoperable
internal neuroﬁbroma caused painful
compression on the gastrointestinal
tract and induced bowel obstructive
symptoms. The maximal pain intensity
was scored 9 of 10 on an NRS. The
severity of symptoms required oral
morphine treatment and emergency
consultations for intravenous mor-
phine to manage acute pain crisis. A 5-
ﬂuorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
tomography–computed
tomography
(5-FDG-PET/CT) scan revealed no signs
of malignant transformation (maximum
standard uptake value 3.2). According to
the severity of clinical symptoms, sirolimus
was initiated in April 2010 at an initial
dosage of 1 mg per day after dis-
cussion by health care providers. The

CASE REPORT

dosage was increased to 3 mg per day
at 3 months and 4 mg per day at 6
months. Sirolimus was well tolerated by
clinical and biological proﬁles. At 6
months, pain was decreased in intensity
and frequency and morphine was
gradually stopped without withdrawal
symptoms. Two short painful episodes
were reportedly relieved by prompt
morphine; sirolimus had been tempo-
rarily discontinued because of sub-
cutaneous NF surgery. At 1 year, there
was no more abdominal pain and no
need for analgesic treatments (NRS 0/
10). MRI revealed no difference from
baseline in volume of PN and 5-FDG-PET/
CT images were unchanged.
Three years after starting sirolimus, the
volume of the PN was stable and the
patient remained pain-free.

PATIENT 2

A 16-year-old adolescent boy with fa-
milial NF1 was followed for painful and
diffuse subcutaneous and internal
neuroﬁbromas. MRI revealed a large PN
involving the brachial plexus (4 3
14 cm). In addition, a retroperitoneal
mass (7 cm) and pelvic mass with dif-
fuse extension into the sciatic nerves
(11 cm) were identiﬁed (Fig 2). 5-FDG-
PET/CT revealed no signs of malignant
transformation. The patient experi-
enced intense neuropathic pain of the 4
limbs (average pain score 8/10 on the
NRS), which was uncontrolled by max-
imal
tolerated doses of pregabalin,
amitriptyline, and tramadol. The pa-
tient had been hospitalized a few
months earlier with coma because of
excess drug consumption. Surgery was
not advised because of the extensive
nature of internal
lesions. After dis-
cussion, sirolimus as compassionate
use was started at 1 mg per day in
December 2010. A dosage of 2 mg per
day was not well tolerated because
of drowsiness. The dosage was ﬁnally
maintained at 1 mg per day. At 6
months, the patient had no more pain,

genotype-phenotype correlations have
been demonstrated for NF1 except in
cases of large NF1 gene deletions.16
Performing genetic testing to conﬁrm
the NF1 diagnosis was not done in our
patients because this was not
the
standard of care at our institution at
the time this retrospective study was
performed. In addition, for the same
reason, genomic data were not avail-
able for the plexiform neuroﬁbroma
tumor specimens before the initiation
of sirolimus. PNs, although benign
nerve-sheath tumors, can be debil-
itating complications of NF1. Sirolimus
was initiated as compassionate use
for inoperable and painful PNs with
signiﬁcant risk of morbidity. At 1 year,
although we could have expected an
enlargement of mass, the volume of
PNs had not changed. Furthermore,
pain had decreased substantially in
all 3 cases, which led to decreasing
and ﬁnally stopping all analgesics.
Stable volume of PN was observed at
2.5 years and the near disappearance
of pain. The analgesic effect of sirolimus
in patients with NF1 has never been
reported and may be directly explained
by inhibition of the mTOR pathway.17,18
Sirolimus inhibits mTOR activity by
phosphorylation of proteins involved
in cell growth control and angiogen-
esis. Previous studies demonstrated
an activation of the mTOR pathway in
NF1, which could be inhibited with
sirolimus.9–11,19 As well, sirolimus
reduced proliferation associated with
loss of neuroﬁbromin expression in
human malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumor cells.12 However, the
lifetime risk of developing malignant
transformation in presence of PN is
20 times higher than in individuals
without internal PN,13 and at year 3,
patient 3 developed a malignant pe-
ripheral nerve sheath tumor that
was not prevented by the use of
sirolimus.

which led to decreasing pregabalin and
amitriptyline. All analgesics were stop-
ped at 1 year, without any relapse in pain.
The average pain was scored 3 of 10 on
the NRS. MRI revealed no difference from
baseline in volume of PNs. 5-FDG-PET/CT
revealed mild hypermetabolism (maxi-
mum standard uptake value 3) without
signs of malignant transformation.
At 2.5 years, patient 2 had stable volume
of PN and the near disappearance of
pain.

PATIENT 3

An 8-year-old girl with a sporadic NF1
had extensive PNs of the right thigh
(107 3 88 3 86 mm) and pelvis (199 3
173 3 79 mm). These lesions com-
pressed adjacent organs, particularly
the rectum, bladder, and right sciatic
nerve inﬁltration and were responsible
for excruciating neuropathic pain. The
pain specialist prescribed several oral
analgesics, which failed to relieve the
pain, including gabapentine at 30 mg/kg
per day, codeine at 0.75 mg/kg per day,
diazepam at 1 mg 3 times daily, ami-
triptyline at 8 mg once daily, and car-
bamazepine at 20 mg/kg per day. Pain
scored an average of 4 of 10 on the
faces rating scale, with peaks of pain
described as being 10 of 10 in intensity.
Because of
the pain, she used a
wheelchair. Surgical management was
considered not possible. After multi-

disciplinary evaluation,
the patient
received imatinib, 260 mg/m2, in 2009
for 6 months. This treatment was not
helpful for control of tumor growth or
pain. To preserve renal function, bi-
lateral ureterostomy with cystectomy
and panhysterectomy was performed
in January 2010. After multidisciplin-
ary discussion, sirolimus was given
orally in April 2010, at a beginning
daily dosage of 0.25 mg/m2 body sur-
face area, 0.2 mg per day, as estab-
lished for patients with tuberous
sclerosis with angiomyolipomas14 and
then gradually increased to achieve
a maximum tolerated dose of 2 mg per
day in December 2011. At 6 months,
pain had completely disappeared,
which allowed for stopping amitrip-
tyline and carbamazepine. At 1 year,
no relapse of pain was observed. MRI
revealed stable volume of the internal
PN as compared with baseline. Sirolimus
was well tolerated on clinical proﬁle.
Slightly increased triglyceride levels
were observed. While stable on sirolimus
for 36 months, transformation of
the PN to a malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumor occurred in May
2013.

DISCUSSION

The National Institutes of Health NF1
diagnostic criteria were used to con-
ﬁrm the diagnosis in our 3 cases.4,15 No

mTOR seems to be involved in pain
processing. The mTOR complex 1
(mTORC1) is implicated in regulating
local protein synthesis in dendrites and

axons and in modulating plasticity and
memory processes.20,21 Furthermore,
mTOR is expressed and constitutively
phosphorylated in myelinated A-ﬁbers

in the peripheral nerve, and afferent
nociceptors are thought to be regulated
by the mTORC1 signaling pathway.21,22
Recently, inhibition of mTOR activity by

intraplantar injection of rapamycin in
mice blocked hypersensitivity induced
by local
injection of capsaicin, as
well as neuropathic pain induced
by spinal nerve ligation.17,22 In addi-
tion,
in a mouse model of neuro-
pathic pain, systemic administration
of the mTORC1 inhibitor temsirolimus
acutely and chronically inhibited the
mTORC1 pathway in sensory axons
and the spinal dorsal horn.23 These
results highlight
the importance of

the mTORC1 pathway as a regulator
of nociceptor sensitivity24,25 and its
potential
indication for therapeutic
intervention in chronic neuropathic
pain.23

CONCLUSIONS

Severe PNs in NF1 are a major cause of
morbidity due to intractable pain. PNs
carry a high risk of malignant trans-
formation and can be life-threatening.

Our clinical observation emphasizes
an unexpected effect of sirolimus on
pain, which contributes to improve
quality of life. The mTOR pathway may be
both a major mediator of NF1 tumor
growth and regulator of nociceptor
sensitivity. The role of
the mTORC1
pathway as a regulator of nociceptor
sensitivity could be discussed. mTOR
inhibitors clinically used as anticancer
and immunosuppressant drugs may be
a potential treatment of severe NF1.
