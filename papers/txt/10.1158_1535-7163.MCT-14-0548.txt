Abstract

Although combined chemoradiotherapy has provided consid-
erable improvements for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),
recurrence and metastasis are still frequent. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway plays a critical role in tumor formation and tumor cell
survival after radiation-induced DNA damage. In the present
study, we evaluated whether inhibition of PI3K/mTOR by two
novel dual inhibitors, GSK2126458 and PKI-587, could suppress
tumor progression and sensitize NPC cells to radiation. Four NPC
cell lines (CNE-1, CNE-2, 5-8F, and 6-10B) were used to analyze
the effects of GSK216458 and PKI-587 on cell proliferation,
migration, invasion, clonogenic survival, amount of residual
g-H2AX foci, cell cycle, and apoptosis after radiation. A 5-8F
xenograft model was used to evaluate the in vivo effects of the
two compounds in combination with ionizing radiation (IR).

Both GSK216458 and PKI-587 effectively inhibited cell prolifer-
ation and motility in NPC cells and suppressed phosphorylation
of Akt, mTOR, S6, and 4EBP1 proteins in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner. Moreover, both compounds sensitized
NPC cells to IR by increasing DNA damage, enhancing G2‚ÄìM cell-
cycle delay, and inducing apoptosis. In vivo, the combination of IR
with GSK2126458 or PKI-587 signiÔ¨Åcantly inhibited tumor
growth. Antitumor effect was correlated with induction of apo-
ptosis and suppression of the phosphorylation of mTOR, Akt, and
4EBP1. These new Ô¨Åndings suggest the usefulness of PI3K/mTOR
dual inhibition for antitumor and radiosensitizing. The combi-
nation of IR with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, GSK2126458 or
PKI-587, might be a promising therapeutic strategy for NPC. Mol

Introduction

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most common cancer
of the head and neck, and it is highly prevalent and endemic in
Southern China and Southeast Asia (1). Currently, patients with
NPC are mainly treated by ionizing radiation (IR) or chemoradia-
tion, and many early-stage patients could be cured. However,
there are still a substantial proportion of patients with NPC who
fail to achieve long-term disease control and die from local

recurrence and metastasis (2). The dismal prognosis of NPC may
due to its radioresistance (3, 4). Therefore, Ô¨Ånding a way of
enhancing the radiosensitivity may provide a more effective
therapeutic strategy and improve the prognosis of NPC.

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is an intracellular signaling path-
way that plays a critical role in tumor formation, and these proteins
are central to the regulation of tumor cell proliferation, metabo-
lism, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and survival (5). The pos-
sible mechanisms by which this pathway regulates NPC prolifer-
ation include mutations in PI3K, PTEN deleted from chromosome
10 (PTEN), and Ras oncogene, as well as EGFR ampliÔ¨Åcation (6‚Äì8).
Previous studies showed that PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is fre-
quently activated in many cancers, including lung, gastric, renal,
and ovarian cancers (9‚Äì12), and inhibition of this pathway could
increase radiosensitivity (8, 13‚Äì18). NPC cell lines and tissues also
overexpressed phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt; refs. 19‚Äì21). Recently,
we reported that Akt expression in NPC cells and biopsies from
patients with NPC could be increased by IR, which is associated
with metastasis, suggesting that the PI3K/mTOR pathway might be
an ideal therapeutic target in NPC (22). Preclinical studies have
demonstrated that targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway by a dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235, sensitized the antitumor
effect of cisplatin in NPC (23). However, there is little data about
the effect of inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling on tumor
progression and radiosensitivity in NPC.

GSK2126458 and PKI-587 are highly selective and potent
small-molecule inhibitors which could effectively suppress both
multiple class I PI3K isoforms and mTOR kinase activity (24, 25).

in patients with solid tumors or

GSK2126458 has been identiÔ¨Åed as a highly potent, orally bio-
available inhibitor of p110a, p110b, p110g, p110d, mTORC1,
and mTORC2. It can induce a signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in the levels of
p-Akt, inhibit growth, and induce G1 phase arrest in breast cancer
(24). Furthermore, GSK2126458 is currently tested in a phase I
clinical
lymphoma
(NCT00972686). PKI-587 is a highly potent dual inhibitor of
PI3Ka, PI3Kg, and mTOR. Preclinical studies have demonstrated
potent inhibitory effects of PKI-587 on a variety of human cancer
cell lines, such as breast, glioma, lung, melanoma, colon, and liver
cancer (25, 26). Because PKI-587 has strong antitumor activity in
vitro and in xenograft models, it is currently being evaluated in a
phase I clinical trial in patients with solid tumors (NCT00940498).
In this study, we investigated the antitumor and radiation-
sensitizing effect of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in NPC both in
vitro and in vivo. To provide better insight into the effect of dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and test whether comparable results
would be obtained, we investigated two dual PI3K/mTOR inhi-
bitors, GSK2126458 and PKI-587. We propose that the combi-
nation of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and IR may lead to impor-
tant clinical beneÔ¨Åts in NPC and provide the basis for further
development of a targeted therapeutic strategy for NPC.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and reagents

Three NPC cell lines (CNE-2, 5-8F, and 6-10B) were kindly
provided by Prof. Yunfei Xia (Sun Yat-sen University Cancer
Center, Guangzhou, P.R. China) in 2013. The CNE-1 and NP69
cell lines were maintained in our laboratory. Human immortal-
ized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP69 was cultured in
Keratinocyte/serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented
with bovine pituitary extract (BD Biosciences). Other human
NPC cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640, supplemented
with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 50 mg/mL streptomycin, and
2 mmol/L glutamine in a humidiÔ¨Åed CO2 incubator at 37
C. All
cells were passaged for less than 3 months before renewal from
frozen, early-passage stocks obtained from the indicated sources.
Cells were tested and authenticated within 3 months before the
start of this study by examining their karyotypes, images, and
speciÔ¨Åc gene expression.



The dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitors, GSK2126458 and PKI-
587, were obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Houston) and dis-
solved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 10 mmol/L.

Cell proliferation assay

Cell proliferation was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthia-
zol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) dye reduction method.
In brief, tumor cells (2  103/100 mL/well) were plated into each
well of 96-well plates in RMPI-1640 with 10% FBS and incubated
for 24 hours. Culture medium containing several concentrations
of GSK2126458 (0‚Äì3 mmol/L) or PKI-587 (0‚Äì3 mmol/L) were
added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 24 to 72 hours.
Next, 50 mL of MTT (2 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each

well, and cells were incubated for 2 hours at 37
C. The medium
containing MTT solution was removed, and the dark blue crystals
were dissolved by adding 100 mL DMSO. The absorbance was
measured with a microplate reader at test and reference wave-
lengths of 550 and 630 nm, respectively. The percentage growth
was determined relative to untreated controls. Each experiment
was performed at least three times, each with triplicate samples.

Antibodies and Western blotting

The primary antibodies used in this study were rabbit anti-
mTOR (2972), phospho-mTOR (5536), Akt (9272), phospho-Akt
(4060), S6 (2217), phospho-S6 (2211), 4EBP1 (9644), phospho-
4EBP1 (2855), c-PARP (9544), p21 (2947), p27kip1 (3688), Cyclin
D1 (2978; 1:1000 each; Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-
g-H2AX (1:1000, ab22551, Abcam), E-Cadherin (610181), and
Vimentin (550513; 1:2000 each; BD Biosciences). Western blot-
ting was performed as previously described (27).

Wound-healing assay

Cells were seeded on 6-well plates at 80% to 90% conÔ¨Çuence.
After 24-hour incubation, cells were wounded by using a 0.2-mL
pipette tip to scratch the subconÔ¨Çuent cell monolayer. Then, the
detached cells were removed by washing with PBS before
GSK2126458 (0.003mmol/L) or PKI-587 (0.03 mmol/L) was
added to the plates. Cells were maintained in serum-free medium
and allowed to migrate for 24 hours. An inverted microscope was
used to photograph the cell migration images at different time
points after wounding (0, 12, and 24 hours), and the speed of
migration was acquired by dividing the length of the gap at
different time points. Motic Images Advanced 3.2 software was
used to analyze the relative surface distance traveled by the leading
edge. Three replicates each of two independent experiments were
performed.

Cell migration and invasion assay

Cell migration and invasion assays were evaluated in Trans-
well chambers (Corning Costar), and cell invasion was evalu-
ated by adding Matrigel (BD Bioscience) to the chambers.
Before the assay, cells were serum-starved for 24 hours. The
top and bottom Transwell chambers were separated by an 8-
mm-pore Ô¨Ålter that had been coated with collagen (30 mg/Ô¨Ålter).
For the migration assay, 1  105 tumor cells were plated in the
top chamber with 0.1% BSA. For the invasion assay, cells were
seeded on Ô¨Ålters coated with 20 to 50 mg/cm2 of reconstituted
Matrigel basement membranes (BD Biosciences). Culture
medium containing GSK2126548 (0.003 mmol/L) or PKI-587
(0.03 mmol/L) was added to the bottom chamber. After incu-
bation for 24 hours at 37
C, cotton swabs were used to remove
the cells that had not migrated or invaded from the top surface
of the Ô¨Ålters. The cells that had migrated or invaded to the
bottom surface were Ô¨Åxed in 100% methanol and stained with
0.5% crystal violet. Migration or invasion cells were quantitated
by counting cells in six randomly selected Ô¨Åelds on each Ô¨Ålter
under a microscope at 200 magniÔ¨Åcation and graphed as the
mean of three independent experiments.



Clonogenic survival assays

Clonogenic survival assays were performed as previously
described (27). Treatment with GSK2126458 (0.003 mmol/L) or
PKI-587 (0.03 mmol/L) was 1 hour before cells exposed to different
doses of IR (0‚Äì8 Gy) and washed away 24 hours after IR.

g-H2AX assay

Cells were plated in chamber slides, incubated for 24 hours,
and pretreated with either GSK2126458 (0.003 mmol/L) or PKI-
587 (0.03 mmol/L) 1 hour before IR (4 Gy), and the number of
residual foci was determined at 24 hours after IR. Cells were Ô¨Åxed
in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with a primary antibody
against g-H2AX (Abcam). Then, the primary antibody was washed

off, and a secondary antibody conjugated to FITC was applied to
the slides. DNA damage was visualized with a Ô¨Çuorescence
microscope (Olympus BX51). For each group, the g-H2AX foci
were counted in at least 50 cells.

Cell cycle and apoptosis

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with GSK2126458
(0.003 mmol/L) or PKI-587 (0.03 mmol/L) for 1 hour before IR
(4 Gy) and were harvested at 24 hours after IR. Cell-cycle distri-
bution was analyzed by propidium iodide (PI) staining and Ô¨Çow
cytometry. After 24 hours of IR, cells were collected, gently washed
with cold PBS containing 2% FBS, Ô¨Åxed in 70% cold ethanol, and
stored at  20

C overnight. Then, cells were pelleted, washed, and
stained with PI/ribonuclease staining buffer (BD Biosciences) for
15 minutes at room temperature. Apoptosis was measured with the
Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences) according
to the manufacturer's protocols. Analysis was performed on the
FACS Calibur using Cell Quest software (BD FACS Aria). All
experiments were performed at least three times.

Xenograft studies

All the animal experiments were carried out in strict accordance
with the principles and procedures approved by the Committee
on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Southern Medical Uni-
versity (Guangzhou, People's Republic of China). Suspensions of
5  106/0.2 mL 5-8F cells were injected subcutaneously into the
right hindlimbs of 5- to 7-week-old female BALB/c-nu/nu nude
mice. When tumor volumes reached 200 mm3, mice were ran-
domly assigned to control and treated groups (5 mice per group).
The treated groups received 300 mg/kg GSK2126458, 25 mg/kg
PKI-587, IR, 300 mg/kg GSK2126458 combined with IR, or 25 mg/
kg PKI-587 combined with IR. The doses of GSK2126458 and PKI-
587 used in vivo were based on the instructions from Selleck
Chemicals and the results from a preliminary experiment.
GSK2126458 was administered by intragastric administration
once daily for 5 consecutive days each week and PKI-587 was
administered by intravenous injection via tail vein once per 5 days
according to the instructions from Selleck Chemicals. Mice in the
IR groups were irradiated with 2 Gy every other day for four
treatments. In combination therapy, GSK2126458 or PKI-587 was
administered 2 hours before IR exposure. Tumor sizes were
calculated every 2 days using the formula: (length  width2)/2.
Tumor regrowth delay was expressed as the time in days for
xenografts treated with GSK2126458, PKI-587, or radiation to
grow from 200 to 1,000 mm3 in volume minus the time in days
for untreated tumors to reach the same size.

IHC and TUNEL assays

IHC staining was performed using tissues (5 mm thick)
harvested from the 5-8F xenografts. Tissue sections were Ô¨Åxed
overnight in 4% formaldehyde and then embedded in parafÔ¨Ån
for
IHC. After deparafÔ¨Ånization and hydration, parafÔ¨Ån-
embedded sections were pretreated for 20 minutes with 10
mmol/L sodium citrate buffer in a microwave for antigen
retrieval. Next, the tissue sections were incubated overnight at

4
C with antibodies against p-mTOR (2976, 1:100 dilution), p-
Akt (3837, 1:100 dilution), p-4EBP1 (2855, 1:100 dilution),
and Ki67 (9027, 1:600 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology).
The sections were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated secondary antibodies (SP-9000; Zhongshan Gold
Bridge) for 1 hour. Finally, slides were counterstained with

hematoxylin and eosin and observed and photographed with a
microscope-mounted camera system. At least three random
Ô¨Åelds were examined in each section.

The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase‚Äìmediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using TdT-
mediated TUNEL method, performed according to manufac-
turer's instructions of Apoptosis Detection System (Promega).

Statistical analysis

All data are expressed as the mean  SDs of experiments
repeated at least three times. SigniÔ¨Åcant differences between the
means were measured by two-tailed unpaired Student t test or
one-way ANOVA. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.

Results
GSK2126458 and PKI-587 inhibit NPC cell proliferation by
blocking PI3K/mTOR signaling

We Ô¨Årst examined the expression levels of total and phos-
phorylated mTOR, Akt, S6, and 4EBP1 in four NPC cell lines
and an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell
line
(NP69). Western blotting showed strong expression of phos-
phorylated mTOR, Akt, S6, and 4EBP1 in NPC cells, whereas
only weak expression of these proteins were detected in NP69
(Fig. 1A), indicating that a high level of activation of the PI3K/
mTOR pathway is characteristic of NPC cells. Next, we evaluated
the effect of GSK2126458 and PKI-587 on the proliferation of
NPC cells. The structures of these two compounds were shown
in Supplementary Fig. S1. As shown in Fig. 1B and C,
GSK2126458 and PKI-587 decreased the viability of NPC cells
at low nanomolar concentrations and in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner, and all four NPC cell
lines were
sensitive to GSK2126458 and PKI-587, especially CNE-2 and
5-8F cells. Furthermore, we determined whether GSK2126458
and PKI-587 inhibited proliferation of NPC cells via modulat-
ing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 1D and E,
GSK2126458 and PKI-587 inhibited phosphorylation of
mTOR, Akt, S6, and 4EBP1, leading to increased cleaved-PARP
in NPC cell
lines in a concentration- and time-dependent
manner. These effects were shown at concentrations of 0.003
to 0.01 mmol/L and 0.03 to 0.1 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1E and
Supplementary Fig. S2), and started within 1 hour of exposure
and persisted for at least 24 hours (Fig. 1D). These results
demonstrated that PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, both GSK2126458
and PKI-587, effectively inhibited proliferation of NPC cells by
blocking the PI3K/mTOR/S6/4EBP1 signaling pathway. Because
administration of 0.003 mmol/L GSK2126458 and 0.03 mmol/L
PKI-587 could signiÔ¨Åcantly inhibit the signaling pathway with
little effect on cell viability after 24 hours, those concentrations
of inhibitors were chosen for additional experiments.

GSK2126458 and PKI-587 inhibit migration and invasion of
NPC cells

To determine whether these two inhibitors could affect migra-
tion and invasion of NPC cells, we performed wound-healing and
migration assays with GSK2126458 and PKI-587 treatment. As
shown in Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3A, these two com-
pounds signiÔ¨Åcantly decreased the speed of wound healing.
Moreover, the number of cells migrating through the transwell
chamber polycarbonate membrane in the GSK2126458 and PKI-
587 treated groups was markedly less than that in the control

group (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3B). Treatment with
GSK2126458 or PKI-587 also substantially impaired ability of
cells to invade the Ô¨Ålters (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S3C).
For epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, the
level of E-cadherin was increased and the level of Vimentin was
reduced in CNE-2 and 5-8F cells 24 hours after treatment with
GSK2126458 or PKI-587 (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these results
suggest that the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, GSK2126458 and
PKI-587, could effectively inhibit the migration and invasion of
NPC cells, which may be associated with reduced EMT phenotypic
expression.

Targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway with GSK2126458 or
PKI-587 increases the radiosensitivity of NPC cells

Because Akt has been implicated in cell survival responses after
IR, we hypothesized that the combination of IR with PI3K/mTOR
blockade would increase the radiosensitivity of NPC cells

(28‚Äì30). As expected, the combination of IR with either of these
two compounds signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced survival fraction post-IR in
NPC cells (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S4A and Supplemen-
tary Table). We selected 0.003 mmol/L of GSK2126458 and 0.03
mmol/L of PKI-587 in combination with IR because these con-
centrations signiÔ¨Åcantly inhibited the signaling pathway (Fig. 1E)
but had little effect on cell viability after 24 hours (Fig. 1C).
Further investigation indicated that GSK2126458 or PKI-587
could signiÔ¨Åcantly suppress the activation of PI3K/mTOR signal-
ing, whereas IR alone trends to slightly enhance the phosphor-
ylation of Akt, mTOR, and S6. However, combination of IR with
either of these two inhibitors inhibited phosphorylation of PI3K
and mTOR, causing reduced phosphorylation of S6 and 4EBP1 in
NPC cell lines (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4B). These data
strongly suggested that GSK2126458 and PKI-587 could increase
the radiosensitivity of NPC cells by inhibiting the PI3K/mTOR
signaling pathway.

Radiosensitization induced by the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
is accompanied by persistence of g-H2AX foci

To better understand the molecular mechanism of the radio-
sensitizing role of GSK2126458 or PKI-587, we investigated the
effects of GSK2126458 and PKI-587 on the DNA damage
response by measuring the number of g-H2AX foci post-IR.
Treatment with GSK2126458 or PKI-587 alone has little effect
on g-H2AX foci. However, GSK2126458 or PKI-587 in combina-
tion with IR led to a dramatic persistence of g-H2AX foci and
protein at 24 hours post-IR compared with IR alone (Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Fig. S5), indicating that radiosensitization of
these inhibitors is accompanied by the persistence of g-H2AX
expression.

The combination of IR and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors induces
cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in NPC cells

To investigate whether these two PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
radiosensitized NPC cells via redistribution of cell cycle, we
performed cell-cycle assay on NPC cells exposed to IR and/or
the inhibitors. Treatment with GSK2126458 or PKI-587 alone
led to an increased percentage of cells in G1 phase, whereas IR
alone led to a G2‚ÄìM arrest. Strikingly, the combination of IR
with GSK2126458 (0.003 mmol/L) or PKI-587 (0.03 mmol/L)
induced a further arrest in the G2‚ÄìM phase, which highlights
the potential radiosensitizing capability of these reagents (Fig.
5A and Supplementary Fig. S6A). Further investigation indi-
cated that the level of cyclin D1 was decreased 24 hours after
treatment with GSK2126458 or PKI-587 (Supplementary Fig.
S6B). Meanwhile the expression of p21 and p27 were increased
24 hours post-IR (Supplementary Fig. S6B). The combination

of IR with GSK2126458 or PKI-587 further increased the level
of p21 and p27, accompanied with dramatic decrease of cyclin
D1 (Supplementary Fig. S6B).

In addition,

treatment with IR (17.1%), GSK2126458
(10.6%), or PKI-587 (9.2%) alone could induce apoptosis in
5-8F cells when compared with untreated cells (7.7%). Strik-
ingly, the combination of either GSK2126458 or PKI-587 with
IR could induce apoptosis rate of up to 46.4% and 46.9%,
respectively. Similar results were obtained in CNE-2 cells (Fig.
5B and C). These data indicate that GSK2126458- or PKI-587‚Äì
mediated radiosensitization may be associated with increased
cell apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that the
radiosensitization effects of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
GSK1216458 and PKI-587 were primarily due to inhibition of
DNA repair or augmentation of damage by cycle arrest and
induction of apoptosis.

Combination of dual inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and radiation
therapy is an effective treatment for NPC in vivo

To assess the antitumor effects of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibi-
tors in combination with radiation therapy in vivo, we used the
5-8F xenografted model, which is a well-established model of
NPC using one of the NPC cell lines from our in vitro experi-
ments. As shown in Fig. 6A, GSK2126458 or PKI-587 alone
had a modest antitumor activity and that the IR showed better
inhibition of tumor growth. The combination of IR with
GSK2126458 or PKI-587 resulted in >50% reduction in xeno-
graft volume and tumor regrowth delay when compared with
IR alone (P < 0.05; Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S7A and
S7B).

PI3K/mTOR Inhibition Radiosensitizes NPC

of g-H2AX foci formation in GSK2126458 (0.003 mmol/L), PKI-587 (0.03 mmol/L), IR alone, and their combination groups. Micrographs were taken at 400

To conÔ¨Årm that PI3K/mTOR inhibitor suppresses PI3K/Akt
signaling in vivo, we assessed the expression of phosphorylated
Akt, mTOR, and 4EBP1 in the xenograft tumors. Pathologic
examination of sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin
revealed no signiÔ¨Åcant morphologic abnormalities in any
group. However, GSK2126458 or PKI-587 inhibited phosphor-
ylated Akt, mTOR, and 4EBP1. Consistent with in vitro Ô¨Åndings,
we observed dramatically lower
levels of phosphorylated
mTOR, Akt, and 4EBP1 in tumors from the inhibitor combined
with IR treatment groups (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, IR alone
slightly reduced the phosphorylation of these proteins in vivo.
Western blotting revealed that high levels of phosphorylated
Akt and 4EBP1 were detected in control groups and IR-treated
groups, but lower levels of these two proteins were detected in
tumors treated with either GSK2126458 or PKI-587. The lowest
levels of these two proteins were observed in both inhibitors
combined with IR-treated tumors (Fig. 6C). These data showed
the efÔ¨Åcacy of GSK2126458 and PKI-587 as dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors in vivo.

Consistent with our in vitro Ô¨Åndings, we detected signiÔ¨Åcantly
fewer proliferating cells (Ki67-positive) and more apoptotic cells
(TUNEL-positive) in the inhibitor combined with IR-treated tumors
when compared with either treatment alone (Fig. 6B and D).

Taken together, our in vivo results demonstrated that treatment
with GSK2126458 or PKI-587 alone slightly inhibits tumor
growth, whereas the combination of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition
and IR markedly suppressed tumor progression. This antitumor
effect
is associated with PI3K/Akt pathway inhibition and
apoptosis.

Discussion

The PI3K/Akt pathway is an essential survival factor in the set of
signal transduction cascades that regulate cell survival and apo-
ptosis. Aberrant upregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
occurs commonly in NPC (31‚Äì33). In this study, our results
showed that the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, GSK2126458 and
PKI-587, could suppress the PI3K/mTOR activity, thereby inhibit-
ing NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while induc-
ing apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that the novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, GSK2126458 and PKI-
587, could enhance the radiosensitivity of NPC both in vitro and
in vivo.

Studies of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway have mainly focused
on its role in cell survival, and these proteins are generally
described to work in parallel with the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway,

which drives cell proliferation (12). However, this is an over-
simpliÔ¨Åed division of functions because the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway has been involved in the most important mechanisms
of radioresistance, including intrinsic radioresistance, tumor-cell
proliferation, and hypoxia (34). We have reported that radiation-
inducible PTEN expression radiosensitizes hepatocellular carci-
noma cells, indicating the importance of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt
pathway in radioresistance (35). In this study, our data further
indicated that PI3K/mTOR inhibition could sensitize NPC cells to
radiation by inducing apoptosis, DNA damage, and cell-cycle
arrest. The radiation experiments in the current study were per-
formed under fully oxygenated conditions. Recent studies have
indicated that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors enhance the radiosen-
sitivity of prostate (13) and breast (36) cancer cells under nor-
moxic and hypoxic conditions. Future studies will address wheth-
er these two compounds have an effect on the radiosensitivity of
NPC cells under hypoxic conditions.

In this study, GSK2126458 or PKI-587 reduced the levels of
phosphorylated Akt, mTOR, S6, and 4EBP1 in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner, consistent with other reports
in NPC (23, 37, 38). In addition, we found that very low con-
centrations of GSK2126458 and PKI-587 could effectively inhibit
the migration and invasion of NPC cells, which may be associated
with reduced EMT phenotypic expression, indicating the high
efÔ¨Åcacy of these compounds.

Our data showed that treatment with GSK2126458 or PKI-587
alone induced G1 arrest, IR alone resulted in growth arrest in the
G2‚ÄìM phase, and the combination of IR with either GSK2126458
or PKI-587 markedly prolonged G2‚ÄìM arrest in NPC cells. This

Ô¨Ånding is consistent with a previous report on another PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235 (13). Combining the dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor and IR induced an elevated level of DNA damage, and
this could explain the G2‚ÄìM arrest because G2‚ÄìM phase arrest is a
hallmark of DNA damage (39). Furthermore, the level of cyclin
D1, which is a vital protein, required for the G1‚ÄìS transition, was
decreased 24 hours after treatment with GSK2126458 or PKI-587,
supporting the observations on cell-cycle changes. The expression
of p21 and p27, both of which are associated with suppressing
cell-cycle progression, were increased 24 hours post-IR. The com-
bination of IR with GSK2126458 or PKI-587 further increased the
level of p21 and p27, accompanied with dramatic decrease of
cyclin D1. P21 is reported to be involved in DNA damage repair
after exposure to irradiation. Studies indicated that p21 interacts
with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This p21/
PCNA interaction could inhibit the process of DNA synthesis,
which is a major process in DNA damage repair, leading to an
arrest in the G2‚ÄìM phase (40‚Äì42). Moreover, we found that lower
concentration of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors alone slightly
induced apoptosis. However, the combination of inhibitors and
IR exerts potent proapoptotic properties. The apoptosis may be
caused by increased DNA damage when IR is combined with
GSK2126458 or PKI-587 (43).

We and other investigators have shown that IR increased the
expression and activation of Akt in NPC (22, 44). Therefore,
aberrantly activated Akt may decrease radiosensitivity as a self-
protective feedback loop in tumor cells. In this study, our data
showed that IR alone trends to enhance phosphorylation of Akt/
mTOR signaling proteins in vitro, which was consistent with

previous reports and further indicated the usefulness of PI3K/
mTOR inhibition to radiosensitivity. Interestingly, our in vivo data
showed that the levels of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation in the
tumors in the IR group were lower than those in control tumors.
This is still reasonable because, although IR may increase Akt/
mTOR activation and thereby decrease radiosensitivity, tumors
were eventually inhibited, accompanied by Akt/mTOR inhibi-
tion. Therefore, we supposed that IR-induced Akt/mTOR activa-
tion could be maintained for a short period, after which Akt/
mTOR activation decreased. This hypothesis will be examined in
future studies. On the other hand, although GSK2126458 or PKI-
587 alone could not markedly reduce tumor load in 5-8F xeno-
grafts in the doses used in this study, when combined with IR, they
displayed dramatic antitumor effects, suggesting that the combi-
nation of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and IR is an effective
antitumor strategy for NPC. In addition, our results also con-
Ô¨Årmed that combination of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and IR
produced lower levels of phosphorylation of mTOR and Akt in the
5-8F xenografts compared with either treatment alone. These data
suggested that if IR-induced Akt/mTOR activation was inhibited,
radioresistance might be prevented.

In summary, our results show that targeting PI3K/mTOR sig-
naling in NPC not only has antitumor effect, but also improves the
efÔ¨Åcacy of radiotherapy. The radiosensitizing effect of the dual

PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, GSK2126458 or PKI-587, may be caused
by persistent residual DNA damage and by inducing cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis. These Ô¨Åndings suggest that a combination of
IR and GSK2126458 or PKI-587 may be a useful therapeutic
strategy against NPC. Further evaluation of IR in combination
with GSK2126458 or PKI-587 in clinical trials is warranted to
improve the outcomes of patients with NPC.
