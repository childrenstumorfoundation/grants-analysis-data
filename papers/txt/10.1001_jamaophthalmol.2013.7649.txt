IMPORTANCE Monitoring young children with optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) for visual
deterioration can be difficult owing to age-related noncompliance. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) measures of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness have been
proposed as a surrogate marker of vision but this technique is also limited by patient
cooperation.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether measures of circumpapillary RNFL thickness, acquired
with handheld OCT (HH-OCT) during sedation, can differentiate between young children with
and without vision loss from OPGs.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional analysis of a prospective
observational study was conducted at a tertiary-care children’s hospital. Children with an
OPG (sporadic or secondary to neurofibromatosis type 1) who were cooperative for visual
acuity testing, but required sedation to complete magnetic resonance imaging, underwent
HH-OCT imaging of the circumpapillary RNFL while sedated.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Area under the curve of the receiver operating
characteristic, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value
of the average and quadrant-specific RNFL thicknesses.

RESULTS Thirty-three children (64 eyes) met inclusion criteria (median age, 4.8 years; range,
1.8-12.6 years). In children with vision loss (abnormal visual acuity and/or visual field), RNFL
thickness was decreased in all quadrants compared with the normal-vision group (P < .001 for
all comparisons). Using abnormal criteria of less than 5% and less than 1%, the area under the
curve was highest for the average RNFL thickness (0.96 and 0.97, respectively) compared
with specific anatomic quadrants. The highest discrimination and predictive values were
demonstrated for participants with 2 or more quadrants meeting less than 5%
(sensitivity = 93.3; specificity = 97.9; positive predictive value = 93.3; and negative predictive
value = 97.9) and less than 1% (sensitivity = 93.3; specificity = 100; positive predictive
value = 100; and negative predictive value = 98.0) criteria.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Measures of RNFL thickness acquired with HH-OCT during
sedation can differentiate between young children with and without vision loss from OPGs.
For young children who do not cooperate with vision testing, HH-OCT measures may be a
surrogate marker of vision. Longitudinal studies are needed to delineate the temporal
relationship between RNFL decline and vision loss.

Handheld OCT in Young Children With OPGs

L ow-grade gliomas are the most common central ner-

vous system tumor in children.1 Low-grade gliomas
that involve the pregeniculate afferent visual pathway
are labeled as optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) and histologi-
cally are grade 1 pilocytic or, less commonly, grade 2 fibril-
lary astrocytomas. Optic pathway gliomas are intrinsic to
the axons of the visual pathway and not amenable to surgi-
cal resection.2 They are often sporadic but may arise in as
many as 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1
(NF1), a multisystem genetic disorder occurring in approxi-
mately 1:4000 births.3 Although children with OPGs have
a low mortality rate, with a 5-year survivorship of greater
than 75%,1 they have frequent visual morbidity with perma-
nent visual acuity (VA) loss ranging from mild (ie, 20/40) to
complete blindness.2,4

The management of young children with OPGs can
be complex. Vision loss takes place in many, but not all,
of those with sporadic OPGs and in roughly half of children
with NF1-related OPGs.5 Therefore, in an attempt to
avoid unnecessary chemotherapy, treatment of OPGs is
often only initiated once new or progressive VA loss has
been detected. Most OPGs cause VA and/or visual field (VF)
loss between 1 and 8 years of age.6 Accurately measuring
VA/VF in these young children is highly dependent on their
cooperation; this can be especially difficult in those with
NF1 due to associated cognitive and behavioral problems.7,8
Unfortunately, functional tests, such as visual evoked
potentials,9-13 or changes in imaging features (ie, tumor size
or contrast enhancement) have no temporal relationship
to VA/VF loss.4,6,14 The inability to assess young children
for visual deterioration puts them at greater risk to
experience significant and permanent visual loss before
treatment is initiated. To better guide therapy, a reliable
quantitative biomarker of vision that does not rely on
patient cooperation is needed in young children with
OPGs.6

For more than a decade, the relationship between
VF loss and circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)
thickness, as measured by optical coherence tomography
(OCT), has been firmly established in adults with glau-
coma.15-17 However, the mechanism of axonal degeneration
causing RNFL thinning in glaucoma is clearly different from
that implicated in OPGs.

Two studies have used time-domain OCT to examine
circumpapillary RNFL thickness in older children with
OPGs.18,19 Most participants in both studies were older than
8 years of age, when NF1-related OPGs typically are no lon-
ger symptomatic. Even in some of these older children,
accurate and reliable OCT acquisition could not be accom-
plished owing to poor cooperation.19 Recently, a number of
investigators have used a spectral-domain handheld OCT
(HH-OCT; Bioptigen) device to image the retina and optic
nerve of infants and young children with a variety of
conditions.20-25

The aim of this study was to determine whether mea-
sures of circumpapillary RNFL thickness, acquired with
HH-OCT during sedation, can differentiate between young
children with and without vision loss from OPGs.

Methods

Patients
ChildrenwithOPGsandcontrolparticipantswereidentifieddur-
ing their routine clinical visits to the neuro-ophthalmology or
ophthalmology clinics at Children’s National Medical Center.
Written informed consent from the parent/guardian and writ-
ten assent from the child, when applicable, were obtained be-
fore study enrollment. The study adhered to the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional
reviewboardoftheChildren’sNationalMedicalCenter.Alldata
collected were Health Insurance Portability and Accountabil-
ity Act compliant.

Patients with OPGs had to be diagnosed as having an NF1-
related OPG using established National Institutes of Health cri-
teria or biopsy-proven sporadic OPG. Patients with OPGs and
control participants meeting the following inclusion criteria
were enrolled: (1) ability to perform age-appropriate VA test-
ing; (2) undergoing magnetic resonance image (MRI) under se-
dation as part of their routine clinical care; (3) absence of oph-
thalmologic or neurologic disease that could possibly affect
optic nerve function or VA independently of OPG status (eg,
history of suppression or pattern distortion amblyopia, glau-
coma, elevated intracranial pressure, ventriculoperitoneal
shunting,cataracts,orretinopathyofprematurity);and(4)will-
ingness to receive mydriatic eye drops prior to MRI. Control
participants received a comprehensive neuro-ophthalmo-
logic examination, were required to have normal VA for age,
and could forgo sedated MRI. Children with NF1 whose brain
MRI exhibited a normal visual pathway (ie, no OPG) were in-
cluded in the control group because their RNFL measures were
not different than those of healthy control participants with-
out NF1.19

All participants received a $10 gift card for their participa-
tion. Participants who were unable to cooperate with VA test-
ing were not included in the study because we would not be
able to assess the relationship between RNFL thickness and
VA. Children with ophthalmologic or neurologic disease that
could possibly affect optic nerve function or VA also were ex-
cluded to minimize the impact of non-OPG–related vision loss
on RNFL. For instance, children with vision loss from amblyo-
pia or optic atrophy secondary to hydrocephalus could con-
found our interpretation of the relationship between RNFL
thickness and OPG-related vision loss.

Vision Testing
All participants underwent a complete ophthalmologic exami-
nation within 2 weeks before or after their MRI. Best-
corrected VA testing was performed using age-appropriate
methods (eg, Teller grating acuity cards using an established
protocol26 or recognition acuity testing with computer-based
HOTV optotypes). Visual acuity loss was calculated using age-
based norms and considered abnormal when the result was
greater than or equal to 0.2 logMAR below normal for age. Chil-
dren who were unable to reliably complete grating or recog-
nition VA testing were not included in the analysis. Visual field
testing was performed by confrontation or Goldmann kinetic

perimetry.WhenVFdefectswerereliablydetectedinanyquad-
rant (ie, single or multiple quadrants), the participant’s VF was
defined as abnormal. Our participants’ young age and fre-
quency of associated behavioral problems prevented reliable
completion of automated perimetry and thus limited our abil-
ity to quantify VF deficits; therefore, VF abnormalities were
categorized as either present or absent.

Clinical Characteristics
Clinicalcharacteristicswerecollectedatstudyenrollmentusing
a standardized form that included age, sex, race, ethnicity, di-
agnosis of NF1, history of chemotherapy, and location of OPG
on MRI (determined by a pediatric neuroradiologist). The lo-
cation of OPGs was classified as (1) absent; (2) isolated optic
nerve; (3) optic chiasm with or without optic nerve involve-
ment; or (4) optic tracts with or without involvement of the
chiasmoropticnerves.Bothpatienteyeswereclassifiedashav-
ing OPG when the OPG was present in the optic chiasm and/or
optic tracts. For participants with a unilateral optic nerve
glioma, the unaffected contralateral optic nerve was classi-
fied as having no OPG. When available, both participant eyes
contributed to the analysis because each eye can be affected
differently by the OPG.

Image Acquisition With Handheld OCT
One hour before undergoing MRI, all participants received
mydriatic eye drops (1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenyleph-
rine hydrochloride). All participants with OPGs underwent
sedation induction by inhaled nitrous oxide followed by
inhaled sevoflurane. Once adequately sedated and intrave-
nous access had been achieved, all children were given a
continuous infusion of propofol to maintain sedation. No
patient required mechanical ventilation using this sedation
protocol. Once the propofol infusion began, HH-OCT
imaging commenced using a high-resolution HH device
acquiring 36 000 A-scans per second with a 3.5-μm tissue
resolution and a 2.17-mm scan depth (Bioptigen). The
operator was positioned at the head of the bed, and eyelids
were moved away from the pupil by the operator’s fingers.
The HH-OCT was placed over the patient’s eye and posi-
tioned until optimal image quality was achieved. The work-
ing distance between the HH-OCT probe and the cornea was
based on the child’s axial length and adjusted according to
previous recommendations.20 If the working distance was
suboptimal, producing clipping or vignetting of images, the
working distance could be adjusted manually during the
imaging session by altering the reference arm length.20
Movement of the HH-OCT probe was minimized by the
operator gently bracing his or her hand on the patient’s fore-
head. To optimize image quality, the horizontal and vertical
B-scan images were displayed in real time and were
adjusted to achieve optimal alignment to position the optic
nerve head in the center of the acquisition. For children
with refractive error, the focus of the HH-OCT bore was
instantly adjusted while viewing the live horizontal and ver-
tical B-scan images. Once correct alignment and focus were
achieved, the imaging was initiated by pressing a foot pedal
that acquired a 6 mm × 6 mm rectangular scan centered on

the optic nerve head using 1000 A-scans across 100 B-scans.
Each acquisition was completed in 3 seconds. Given the
relatively small differences in axial length among our par-
ticipants, the scan dimensions and acquisition parameters
were not adjusted for individual patients. Owing to an
evolving imaging protocol, 1 participant was imaged using a
6 mm × 6 mm 300 A-scans per 300 B-scans protocol. Once
image acquisition was complete, a horizontal B-scan and an
en face volume intensity projection image were displayed so
the operator could assess the quality and alignment of the
image. Poor image quality from decreased image signal,
image clipping, increased speckle noise, and motion artifact
were qualitatively assessed by the operator during the
imaging session. If the image quality was unacceptable, the
acquisition could be restarted using the foot pedal. In many
cases, the entire imaging session of both optic nerves could
be completed in less than 60 seconds. When the operator
was unsure whether the image quality was sufficient, he or
she acquired additional images, potentially extending the
imaging session an additional 1 to 2 minutes.

Handheld OCT Analysis
Raw OCT data were exported and analyzed using custom-
made software designed to measure circumpapillary RNFL
thickness using a segmentation algorithm modified from a pre-
viously reported algorithm.27 The optic nerve head margin was
detectedautomaticallyordrawnmanuallyiftheautomaticdisc
margin detection failed. A 3.45-mm circle was then placed over
the geometric center of the optic nerve head. The RNFL thick-
ness measurements were sampled from 1024 A-scans around
the3.45-mmcircle.The1024sampleswereequallydividedinto
4 quadrants (ie, 256 samples per quadrant).

Statistical Analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized by
standard descriptive statistics (eg, means and standard devia-
tions for continuous variables, such as age, and percentages
forcategoricalvariablessuchassex).TheShapiro-Wilktestwas
usedtodeterminethenormalityofthemeanglobalRNFLthick-
ness (microns). Between-group t tests were used to compare
average and quadrant-specific RNFL thicknesses between par-
ticipants with OPG with normal and abnormal vision, as well
as between participants with OPG with normal vision and con-
trol participants.

Receiver operating characteristic analysis, sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
valueweredeterminedbycomparingtheparticipantswithOPG
with normal vision with those with abnormal vision. The cri-
terion for abnormal RNFL thickness was determined as the
lower fifth and first percentile in the normal-vision OPG group.
To examine the relationship between the magnitude of VA
loss (logMAR) and RNFL thickness, while considering the in-
fluence of other clinical variables, we used a generalized es-
timating equation approach to variance estimation to ac-
count for the correlation between eyes of patients. This linear
regression model determined the unadjusted and adjusted as-
sociations of RNFL thickness, age, diagnosis (NF1 or sporadic
OPG), location of the OPG, and history of chemotherapy treat-

lyzed using commercially available software (Stata version 11;
StataCorp).

Results
Thirty-three children with OPGs (n = 25 NF1 related and n = 8
sporadic) were included for a total of 64 study eyes. Two pa-
tients contributed only 1 study eye owing to severe vision loss
and optic atrophy in their contralateral eye with failure of im-
age acquisition or segmentation. Participants were equally dis-
tributed across sex (n = 18 female) but were primarily white
(n = 26) compared with Asian (n = 3) and African American
(n = 3). The median age was 4.8 years (range, 1.8-12.6 years),
with 28 of 33 children (84.8%) being 6 years of age and younger.
Fifteen OPG participant eyes had abnormal vision; 1 eye had
abnormal VA only, 7 eyes had abnormal VF only, and 7 eyes had
both abnormal VA and VF. Forty-nine OPG participant eyes had
normal VA and VF. Optic pathway gliomas were isolated to the
optic nerve (n = 15 eyes), involved the optic chiasm (n = 25
eyes), or involved the optic tracts (n = 17 eyes). Fifteen par-
ticipants received treatment with chemotherapy before or dur-
ing the study. No participant experienced worsening of vi-

The linear regression model using the generalized esti-
mating equation approach demonstrated that mean RNFL

ticipant eyes were not included owing to amblyopia of the con-
tralateral eye, inadequate mydriasis resulting in failure of HH-
OCT acquisition, or the inability to cooperate with testing. The
median age among control participants was 8.7 years (range,
1.7-16.7 years) with 7 of 20 (35%) children being female.

Participants with OPG with normal vision demonstrated
greater RNFL thickness measures in each of the 4 anatomic
quadrants compared with those with vision loss (P < .001 for
all comparisons, Table 1). There was no statistical difference
in RNFL thickness between patients with OPG with normal vi-
sion and control participants (P > .05 for all comparisons,
Table 1).

Table 2 lists the receiver operating characteristic and de-
tection analysis for patients with OPG with 1 or more quad-
rants below the fifth or first percentiles. Analyzing the overall
mean RNFL thickness yielded the highest area under the curve
at both the fifth and first percentiles compared with indi-
vidual quadrants. Using the inferior quadrant as the gold stan-
dard, there was no statistical difference in the area under the
curve among the other 3 quadrants at both the less than 5%
and less than 1% cutoff (P > .05). Table 3 lists the sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
value using the criteria of 1 or more and 2 or more abnormal
quadrants.

Discussion
AnaccurateassessmentofVAandVFisimperativewhenmoni-
toring young children with OPGs because treatment deci-
sions are based on identifying new or progressive vision loss.
Unfortunately, many young children with OPGs have trouble
completing quantitative VA and VF testing.5,29 Our study dem-
onstrates that HH-OCT measures of RNFL thickness can ac-
curately differentiate between young children with and with-
out vision loss secondary to OPGs. The area under the curve,
sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were greatest
when examining the cumulative number of abnormal quad-
rants, although the superior and inferior quadrants per-
formed well. The ability to discriminate between those with
and without vision loss improved when using a criterion of 2
or more abnormal quadrants. The linear regression model also
found a strong relationship between the magnitude of VA loss
and decline in RNFL thickness, suggesting the latter holds the
potential to be a surrogate marker of vision.

Using HH-OCT during sedation in this medically vulner-
able patient population is beneficial for a number of reasons.
It is likely that young children who cannot cooperate with VA
testing are unable to cooperate with conventional OCT de-

vices, whereas HH-OCT permits longitudinal acquisitions from
infancy through adulthood. The portability and speed of HH-
OCT obviate the need for additional sedation during clini-
cally mandated procedures (eg, MRI). The ability to acquire
high-resolution spectral-domain OCT in young children is par-
ticularly relevant to those with OPGs because most become
symptomatic and are treated during early childhood.

The current study extended the findings of the prior time-
domain OCT studies13,14 in 2 important ways. First, most of the
participants in the current study were younger than 6 years
old—the age when most OPGs become symptomatic—
compared with the time-domain OCT studies13,14 whose par-
ticipantswithNF1wereenrolledwellbeyondanagewhenNF1-
related OPGs become symptomatic. Next, by performing
receiver operating characteristic and discrimination analy-
ses, the clinical usefulness of HH-OCT is justified. The nega-
tive predictive values of greater than 97% confirm that those
children with normal RNFL thickness indeed had normal vi-
sion. This finding is relevant to a child who cannot cooperate
with VA testing but whose normal HH-OCT RNFL measures
could provide reassurance that the vision is indeed normal.
The RNFL values in the current study using HH-OCT were
greater in patients with OPG with vision loss when compared
with our prior study using time-domain OCT.14 In our study
using HH-OCT, young children with normal vision had a higher
averageRNFL(mean = 125μm)thanolderchildrenimagedwith
time-domain OCT (mean = 101 μm). Additionally, those pa-
tients with isolated vision loss had an average RNFL thick-
ness of 75 μm using HH-OCT compared with the older pa-
tients with the same type of vision loss whose time-domain

Handheld OCT in Young Children With OPGs

OCT RNFL thickness measures were approximately 65 μm.14
There are multiple factors that could account for the discrep-
ancy between RNFL thickness measures in these 2 studies. The
HH-OCT is a much higher resolution device (3.5 μm) com-
pared with the time-domain OCT (12 μm). In addition, each de-
vice uses a different computer software algorithm to seg-
ment the images and measure the RNFL. Lastly, the children
in the previously published study underwent OCT imaging
many years after their OPG caused vision loss.14 If the RNFL
thicknessmeasuresbetweendeviceswerenearequivalent,this
discrepancy suggests that axonal degeneration could con-
tinuewellbeyondthetimewhenOPGsarebelievedtobesymp-
tomatic (ie, after 8 years of age).

A number of important limitations should be considered
wheninterpretingthedatafromourstudy.Althoughtypicalfor
this patient population, the percentage of participants with
VA/VF loss was relatively low and likely weakened our statis-
tical power despite our robust results. We used a cross-
sectionaldesign,therebylimitingourabilitytoestablishacausal
relationship between RNFL thickness and visual function. Ul-
timately, a multicenter longitudinal study is needed to deter-
minethetemporalrelationshipbetweenadeclineinRNFLthick-
ness and vision loss. Next, we only enrolled individuals who
wereabletocompleteVAtesting.Althoughthosewhowereun-
abletocompleteVAtestingmaybenefitmostfromHH-OCT,this
inclusion criterion was necessary for the current study to es-
tablishtherelationshipbetweenRNFLthicknessandvisionloss.
We imaged children across an age range over which axial
lengths vary considerably, thereby influencing the HH-OCT
sampling. Although we adhered to the recommendations of
Maldonado et al20 to adjust the reference arm and working dis-
tance based on patient age, there is a possibility that children
with different axial lengths had different image sampling rates.
We specifically chose the 6 mm × 6 mm image dimension for
all patients to ensure the acquisitions, even when not exactly
centered, would be sufficient to analyze the data from the
3.45-mm circle positioned around the optic nerve head. Given
the paucity of data quantifying RNFL thickness in young chil-
dren using HH-OCT, it is difficult to determine the magnitude

that sampling difference may have had on our results. Fortu-
nately, the difference in RNFL thickness between partici-
pants with normal and abnormal vision is quite robust, likely
decreasing the influence of under or over sampling.

At this time, we do not recommend using HH-OCT mea-
sures of RNFL thickness to influence clinical care decisions in
children with OPGs. For research purposes, acquiring these
measures at the same frequency as their clinically indicated
MRI will likely provide the most insight into the structure-
function relationship between RNFL thickness and vision. If
future research demonstrates that longitudinal changes in
RNFL thickness are closely coupled to functional changes, it
is conceivable that HH-OCT could reduce the need and/or fre-
quency of MRIs. Performing HH-OCT instead of MRI would be
beneficial in significantly reducing the length of sedation, visit
duration, and total cost. Outside of the risks of sedation, re-
peated HH-OCT imaging sessions are safe and fall well within
standard recommendations.30,31 Despite the potential ben-
efits of HH-OCT, it should never replace a thorough ophthal-
mologic examination by a clinician experienced in caring for
children with OPGs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study demonstrated the ability of RNFL
thickness measures, acquired with high-resolution HH-OCT in
sedated children, to differentiate between young children with
and without vision loss secondary to OPGs. The ability to ac-
quire high-resolution spectral-domain OCT images using an
HH device in sedated children ultimately may be helpful in
young children who cannot cooperate with vision testing or
traditional OCT imaging. Until longitudinal multicenter stud-
ies can better delineate the temporal relationship between
RNFL decline and vision loss, OCT results should not be used
to make clinical decisions. It is our hope that RNFL thickness
eventually may serve as a reliable and objective surrogate
marker of vision that may allow for early detection and treat-
ment of young children with OPGs.
