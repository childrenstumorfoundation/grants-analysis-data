ABSTRACT.  This  study  aimed  to  characterize  the  clinical  features 
of  a  Chinese  pedigree  with  neurofibromatosis  type  1  (NF1)  and  to 
identify  mutations  in  the  NF1  gene.  In  this  three-generation  family 
containing 8 members, 5 had been diagnosed with NF1 and the others 
were  asymptomatic. All  members  of  the  family  underwent  complete 
medical  examinations.  Molecular  genetic  analyses  were  performed 
on all subjects included in the study. All exons of NF1 were amplified 
by  polymerase  chain  reaction,  sequenced,  and  compared  with  a 
reference database. Possible changes in function of the protein induced 
by  amino  acid  variants  were  predicted  by  bioinformatic  analysis.  In 
this family, the 5 patients presented different clinical phenotypes, but 
all  manifested  typical  café-au-lait  macules.  One  novel  frame-shift

mutation,  c.702_703delGT,  in  exon  7  of  NF1  was  identified  in  all 
affected  family  members,  but  not  in  the  unaffected  family  members 
or in 102 normal controls. This mutation generates a premature stop 
codon at amino acid position 720. Additionally, a synonymous mutation 
c.702 G>A was found in 3 family members, including 2 affected and 
1  normal  individuals.  In  conclusion,  our  study  suggests  that  a  novel 
c.702_703delGT frame-shift mutation in NF1 is likely to be responsible 
for the pathogenesis of NF1 in this family. To the best of our knowledge, 
it is the first time that a c.702_703delGT mutation has been identified in 
a family with neurofibromatosis type 1.

INTRODUCTION

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; OMIM#162200), also known as von Recklinghausen 
disease, is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders in humans (Huson et al., 
1989). It occurs in about 1:3500 individuals (Riccardi, 1992; Rasmussen and Friedman, 2000). 
Neurofibromas, which arise from peripheral nerve sheaths, are the key characteristics of NF1 
(Von Deimling et al., 2000), and café-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, and Lisch nodules 
of the iris are also common (Huson and Hughes, 1994; Gutmann et al., 1997; Szudek et al., 
2000). Café-au-lait macules and neurofibromas are frequently present from birth and increase 
in number with age. Skinfold freckling often appears next. Lisch nodules usually only occur 
in adults. The NF1 gene was first associated with NF1 in 1990 and is located on chromosome 
17q11.2, spanning 350 kbp of genomic DNA and containing 60 exons that encode the 2818 
amino acid protein neurofibromin (Cawthon et al., 1990; Viskochil et al., 1990; Wallace et al., 
1990). The NF1 mutation rate is among the highest observed in human genes, with estimates 
ranging from 1/7800 to 1/23,000 gametes (Huson et al., 1989; Clementi et al., 1990; Littler 
and Morton, 1990; Riccardi, 1992; Takano et al., 1992; Li et al., 1995). To date, more than 800 
independent mutations in the NF1 gene among different ethnic groups have been described 
to be associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (Heim et al., 1995; Origone et al., 2002; Cai et 
al., 2005; Bausch et al., 2007; Upadhyaya et al., 1997, 2008; Bottillo et al., 2009; Messiaen et 
al., 2011). About half of NF1 individuals have a positive family history (Clementi et al., 1990; 
Takano et al., 1992; North, 1993). In this study, alterations in the NF1 gene were analyzed in 
a three-generation family containing 8 members, and a novel frame-shift mutation was found.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Family recruitment and clinical examination

A three-generation pedigree with NF1 (Figure 1) was recruited from Chengdu, Sich-
uan Province in China. No consanguineous marriages were noticed in the family. All members 
of this family enrolled in the study underwent complete neurological and ophthalmologic ex-
aminations, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system (3.0T; 
SIEMENS, Berlin, Germany) and slit-lamp microscopy.

The  study  was  prospectively  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Medical  Ethics  Com-
mittees of both West China Hospital of Sichuan University and Shenzhen Eye Hospital of 
Jinan University. Written informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki before blood samples were taken for analysis (see attachment for details). Three 
minors were enrolled in this study for whom written informed consent was obtained from a 
guardians on their behalf (see attachment for details). Neurofibromatosis type 1 was diagnosed 
according to criteria created by the National Institute of Health (NIH) (Anonymous, 1988; 
Gutmann et al., 1997; Huson and Hughes, 1994). Two or more of the following criteria are 
required for positive diagnosis: 1) 6 or more café-au-lait macules >5 mm in maximal diameter 
in prepubescent individuals or >15 mm in maximal diameter after puberty; 2) 2+ neurofibro-
mas of any type or 1 plexiform neurofibroma; 3) freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions; 
4) an optic pathway tumor; 5) 2+ Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas); 6) a distinctive osseous le-
sion, such as sphenoid wing dysplasia or thinning of the cortex of long bones (with or without 
pseudarthrosis); or 7) a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) with NF1 diagnosed by 
the above criteria.

Mutation screening and sequence analysis of the NF1 gene

Informed  consent  was  obtained  from  all  family  members  before  peripheral  blood 
samples were collected (see above). Genomic DNA was extracted from 0.2-mL blood sam-
ples  with  a  Qiamp  Blood  Kit  (Qiagen,  Hilden,  Germany)  following  manufacturer  instruc-
tions. DNA integrity was evaluated using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. All exons of NF1

were amplified from genomic DNA of each participant by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
using the forward and reverse primers (Table 1). PCR was performed using 30-µL reaction 
mixtures, each containing 1 μg genomic DNA, 1X PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM per 
dNTP component, 0.05 U Taq DNA polymerase, 0.3 μM forward primer, and 0.3 μM reverse 
primer. Cycling conditions included an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 2 min, followed 
by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 20 s, annealing at 48°-54°C for 30 s, and extension at 
72°C for 2 min, followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. The amplified products 
were purified using a cycle-pure kit (OMEGA; Bio-Tek, Doraville, GA, USA) and sequenced 
on an ABI 3730XL automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). 
Nucleotide sequences were compared pairwise with the published NF1 sequences. Mutations 
were named according to the nomenclature recommended by the Human Genomic Variation 
Society (HGVS, http://www.hgvs.org/).

Bioinformatic analysis

The ClustalW tool (http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html) was used to align neuro-

fibromin protein sequences among 8 different species.

RESULTS

Clinical findings of the pedigree

The proband (III-2) presented neurofibromas of the right orbit and abdomen, dozens of 
café-au-lait macules and axillary freckling, and was diagnosed with NF1 at the age of 3 years 
(Figure 2). Orbital CT revealed a subcutaneous soft tissue mass of the right eyelid and sphenoid 
wing dysplasia. Even though MRI demonstrated many high-T2-signal-intensity brain lesions, 
the patient did not have dyskinesia or sensory disturbance. This patient underwent surgical exci-
sion of orbital neurofibroma, and biopsy demonstrated plexiform neurofibroma. The proband’s 
grandmother (I-2) was diagnosed with NF1 at the age of 35 years. During examination, nearly 
100 subcutaneous neurofibromas were found scattered over her whole body, with a diameter that 
varied widely from 2 to 6 cm. This patient also presented sphenoid wing dysplasia and scattered 
café-au-lait macules. The mother of the proband (II-2) had hundreds of café-au-lait macules, iris 
hamartomas, and freckling in the axillary and inguinal regions. Patient II-4’s clinic manifestation 
was similar to her mother’s (I-2), but the size of subcutaneous neurofibromas was much smaller. 
III-3 was an 8-year-old boy, on whom only dozens of café-au-lait macules were found on his 
trunk and four limbs. No abnormalities were found in the rest of the family numbers.

NF1 mutation identification and analysis

Sequence analysis of NF1 revealed a novel frame-shift mutation, c.702_703delGT, in 
exon 7 of all 5 patients but not in any of the asymptomatic members of this family or the 102 
normal controls. The c.702_703delGT mutation cosegregated with disease within this family 
(Figure 3). One synonymous mutation, c.702 G>A, in exon 7 of NF1 was also identified in 
3 family members, including 2 affected family members (I-2, III-2) and 1 normal individual 
(III-1) (data not shown).

Bioinformatic analysis

The deletion of a guanine and thymine in codon 702-703 of NF1 exon 7 caused frame 
shift and introduced a premature stop signal at codon 720, which resulted in the termination of 
the amino acid sequence starting at position 234 of neurofibromin. The amino acid sequence 
around leucine in 234 was highly conserved for NF1, based on an analysis of orthologs from 
8 different species by using an internet ClustalW tool (Figure 4).

5402

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common autosomal dominant disorder with equal 
gender incidence (Huson et al., 1989). The presentation of most disease manifestations is age-
dependent and its penetrance is thought to approach 100% by age 20 (Boyd et al., 2009). Sig-
nificant advances in the understanding of NF1 stemmed from the discovery of the NF1 gene 
(Cawthon et al., 1990; Viskochil et al., 1990; Wallace et al., 1990). Neurofibromin, the NF1 
gene protein product, has an RAS-GTPase activating protein-related domain that can inactive 
p21-RAS by activating the intrinsic GTPase of p21-RAS-GTP to hydrolyze GTP to GDP (Xu 
et al., 1990; Golubic et al., 1992). RAS is a key component of many growth factor signaling 
pathways, indicating that neurofibromin serves as a regulator of signals for cell proliferation and 
differentiation, and in the absence of neurofibromin, it will drive uncontrolled cell proliferation 
(Viskochil, 1999). Therefore, NF1 is thought to act as a tumor suppressor gene. To date, many 
types of mutations have been identified, such as chromosome abnormalities, insertions, dele-
tions, point mutations, 3'-untranslated region mutations, stop mutations, and splicing mutations 
(Boyd et al., 2009; Rasmussen and Friedman, 2000). However, no true “hotspots” have been 
found in NF1. In this Chinese pedigree, a frame-shift mutation (c.702_703delGT) in exon 7 
was identified in all affected patients, but not in any normal family member or healthy control. 
This c.702_703delGT NF1 mutation produced a premature stop codon at position 720, which 
resulted in a truncated protein of 240-amino acid residues instead of full-length neurofibromin. 
The frame-shift mutation occurred at the first half of the gene in a region that is highly conserved 
for NF1 based on analysis of orthologs from 8 different species, including Homo sapiens, Pan 
paniscus, Equus caballus, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, Macaca mulatta, Oryctolagus cuniculus, 
Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 4). Such a high degree of conservation 
argues for a functional importance of the relevant amino acid sequence. However, the NF1 pro-
tein may not exist at all in these affected patients based on nonsense-mediated mRNA decay 
(Muhlrad and Parker, 1994; Hentze and Kulozik, 1999; Wagner and Lykke-Andersen, 2002). 
Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is a surveillance mechanism by which cells recognize and 
degrade mRNAs containing premature translation termination codons. Therefore, this genetic 
variant appears to be the causative mutation for the disease in this family.

To date, no obvious corresponding relationships between particular NF1 mutations and 
resulting clinical manifestations have been identified. Our study also showed this absence of a 
close genotype-phenotype relationship, as patients in this pedigree presented different sizes of 
subcutaneous neurofibromas and other clinical manifestations. This feature suggests that other 
factors, including modifying genes, environmental influences, and stochastic factors, are likely 
involved in determining clinical manifestations (Rasmussen and Friedman, 2000).

In conclusion, the c.702_703delGT mutation in NF1 in this pedigree appears to be the 
cause of NF1 in this family. This is the first time that this frame-shift mutation was found and 
this study adds a novel mutation to the existing spectrum of NF1 mutations in patients with 
NF1 and provides further evidence that the loss or diminished function of the neurofibromin 
leads to neurofibromatosis type 1.
