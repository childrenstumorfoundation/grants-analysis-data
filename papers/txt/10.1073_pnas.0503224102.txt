The NF1 tumor suppressor critically regulates
TSC2 and mTOR

Loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene
underlie the familial cancer syndrome neuroﬁbromatosis type I
(NF1). The NF1-encoded protein, neuroﬁbromin, functions as a
Ras-GTPase activating protein (RasGAP). Accordingly, deregulation
of Ras is thought to contribute to NF1 development. However, the
critical effector pathways involved in disease pathogenesis are still
unknown. We show here that the mTOR pathway is tightly regu-
lated by neuroﬁbromin. mTOR is constitutively activated in both
NF1-deﬁcient primary cells and human tumors in the absence of
growth factors. This aberrant activation depends on Ras and PI3
kinase, and is mediated by the phosphorylation and inactivation of
the TSC2-encoded protein tuberin by AKT. Importantly, tumor cell
lines derived from NF1 patients, and a genetically engineered cell
system that requires Nf1-deﬁciency for transformation, are highly
sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, while we
show that the activation of endogenous Ras leads to constitutive
mTOR signaling in this disease state, we also demonstrate that in
normal cells Ras is differentially required for mTOR signaling in
response to various growth factors. Thus, these ﬁndings identify
the NF1 tumor suppressor as an indispensable regulator of TSC2
and mTOR. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that Ras
plays a critical role in the activation of mTOR in both normal and
tumorigenic settings. Finally, these data suggest that rapamycin, or
its derivatives, may represent a viable therapy for NF1.

NF1 is a prevalent familial cancer syndrome affecting 1 in

3,500 individuals worldwide (1). The hallmark feature of the
disease is the development of benign and malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas and MPNSTs, respec-
tively). However, NF1 patients can also exhibit cognitive deficits,
hamartomatous lesions of the iris, and bone deformations and
are predisposed to developing myeloid malignancies, gliomas,
and pheochromocytomas (1, 2).

Although loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 gene result in
the deregulation of Ras (3–7), the specific effector pathways
responsible for disease pathogenesis have not been defined.
Interestingly, NF1 belongs to a group of disorders known as the
phakomatoses (8). This family of diseases exhibits several com-
mon features, including the development of hamartomas [lesions
not classically defined as benign tumors but rather extraneous
masses of well differentiated tissue indigenous to the site of their
development (9)]. Recently, many of the genes responsible for
these diseases, such as PTEN (Cowden disease), LKB1 (Peutz–
Jeghers syndrome), and TSC1 and TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis
complex), have been linked in a common biochemical pathway
(10, 11). Inactivation of all of these genes in primary cells results
in a deregulation of TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling (12–
17). Furthermore, in some cases the cognate human tumor cells
appear to be highly sensitive to TOR inhibitors (rapamycin or
rapamycin derivatives) (12, 13). We therefore sought to deter-
mine whether the TOR pathway might also be critically dereg-
ulated in NF1, in part, to identify a potential therapeutic target
for this devastating disorder.

TOR is an evolutionarily conserved serine兾threonine protein
kinase that regulates cell growth and proliferation in yeast, flies,
and mammals (11). Mammalian TOR (mTOR) has been shown
to be a critical sensor of nutrients, growth factors, and cellular
energy state and integrates signals from each of these pathways
to control a variety of cellular processes (11, 18, 19). Growth
factors activate mTOR via a PI3 kinase-dependent mechanism,
whereas nutrients (amino acids) affect this pathway further
downstream, at the level of tuberin and兾or mTOR itself (11).
Because neurofibromin can negatively regulate the Ras兾PI3
kinase pathway, we hypothesized that the mTOR pathway might
also be deregulated in NF1-deficient cells.

In this article, we show that mTOR is constitutively activated
in Nf1-deficient primary cells. This aberrant activation depends
on Ras and PI3 kinase, which inactivate the TSC2 gene product
tuberin via AKT. Cells derived from NF1 patient tumors simi-
larly exhibit a constitutive phosphorylation of tuberin and an
aberrant activation of mTOR, whereas patient-matched NF1⫹/⫺
cells do not. Importantly, NF1-deficient malignant human tumor
cell lines are exquisitely sensitive to rapamycin. We further
explored the requirement for Ras activation in the normal
regulation of mTOR and found that Ras differentially contrib-
utes to mTOR activation in response to growth factors. Specif-
ically, suppression of Ras activity significantly attenuated mTOR
activation in response to L-␣-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and
insulin but had little or no effect on mTOR activation in response
to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Thus, these findings
identify the NF1 tumor suppressor as a previously uncharacter-
ized component of the mTOR pathway. Furthermore, they
demonstrate that physiological
levels of Ras-GTP critically
modulate mTOR activation in both normal and tumorigenic
settings. Moreover, they suggest the potential utility of rapamy-
cin derivatives in treating NF1 tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Immunoblots. MEFs and NIH 3T3 cells were
grown in DMEM supplemented with FCS or calf serum, respec-
tively. Littermate matched MEFs or NIH 3T3 cells were plated
in serum-free DMEM at a density of 1.0 ⫻ 106 cells per 10-cm
plate. After 18 h, 200 nM insulin, 6 ␮M LPA, or 20 ng兾ml PDGF
was added. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with DMSO,
20 nM rapamycin (Calbiochem), and 200 nM Wortmannin
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min. For amino acid withdrawal studies,
cells were washed and media was replaced with Dulbecco’s PBS
for the indicated times. After stimulation, cells were lysed in 1%
SDS boiling lysis buffer. Neurofibroma-derived patient-matched
NF1⫹/⫺ and NF1⫺/⫺ Schwann cells were isolated and cultured as
previously described in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
0.5 ␮M forskolin (NF1⫹/⫺ cells only), 2.5 ␮g兾ml insulin, 0.5 mM

seeded at a concentration of 2.5 ⫻ 105 cells per 6-cm plate in
DMEM containing 0.1% serum without forskolin, insulin, or
heregulin and lysed as described above. Identical results were
obtained in Schwann cell experiments that were acutely per-
formed in the presence or absence of forskolin. Human MPNST
cell lines were generated from NF1 patients as described in ref.
22. Clarified lysates were normalized for protein levels and
analyzed by Western blotting with the following antibodies:
phospho-p70S6K (T-389), phospho-tuberin (S-939), phospho-
tuberin (T-1462), phospho-Akt (S-473), tuberin (C-20) from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and protein kinase B␣兾AKT1, actin,
and ␤-tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich.

Retroviruses, Lentiviruses, and Transfections. Primary MEFs or
NIH3T3 cells were infected with retrovirus expressing empty
vector, human NF1 GAP-related domain (GRD) (MSCV-GRD-
pac), a dominant-negative p53 (pBabe-hygro-p53DD), or pLPC-
E1A12S and selected with the appropriate antibiotic. For len-
tiviral production, HEK293T cells were transfected with the ⌬8.2
lentiviral construct (encoding gag, pol, rev), VSVG, and either
empty pKO vector or the pKO vector containing the following
sequence transcribing short-hairpin RNAs specific to NF1:
5⬘-TTATAAATAGCCTGGAAAAGG-3⬘. Virus-containing
medium was then used to infect HEK293 cells. Approximately
8–10 h later, infected cells were transiently transfected (Fu-
GENE, Roche) with 0.5 ␮g of pCDNA3-Flag vector or 0.5 ␮g of
pCDNA-Flag encoding C-terminally tagged wild-type tuberin,
the AKT-phosphorylation site mutant tuberin S939A兾T1462A
(both generous gifts from Brendan Manning, Harvard School of
Public Health, Boston), or pCDNA-Flag-NF1-GRD (7). All
infected cells were cotransfected with 0.5 ␮g of rat pRK7-HA-
p70S6K (also from Brendan Manning).

Ras Activation Analysis. NIH3T3 cells were plated in DMEM
containing 3% serum at a density of 1.0 ⫻ 106 cells per 10-cm
plate. After 18 h, cell lysates were normalized, and Ras-GTP was
detected by using a Ras-activation assay per the manufacturer’s
protocol (Upstate Biotechnology).

Immunoprecipitations. HEK293 lysates were prepared in 1.0 ml
of lysis buffer [20 mM Tris, pH 7.5兾150 mM NaCl兾1 mM

along with total cell extracts (10% of immunoprecipitation

the indicated antibodies.

MPNST Proliferation Studies. MPNSTs were seeded at 6.5 ⫻ 104
cells per 6-cm well in normal growth medium containing rapa-
mycin (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 nM) or an equal volume of vector
(DMSO). After 7 days, cells were trypsinized, and live cells were
counted on triplicate plates by using trypan blue exclusion.

Soft Agar Assays. Nf1⫺/⫺ and Nf1⫹/⫹ MEFs were infected with
pLPC-E1A12S-puro and pBabe-p53DD-Hygro. Then, 1.0 ⫻ 104
selected MEFs were suspended in DMEM containing 0.34%
agarose containing either rapamycin (0.1, 1.0, 10, 20, or 50 nM)
or equal volumes of DMSO. Cells were seeded onto a 0.5% agar
base. Four to 6 weeks after the initial seed, colony growth was
assayed by photographing and counting 10 random fields of view
per sample, in triplicate plates or wells. Colony size was assessed
by using IMAGEJ V.1.32J software (http:兾兾rsb.info.nih.gov兾ij).
Results
Because neurofibromin can negatively regulate the Ras兾PI3
kinase pathway, we hypothesized that the mTOR pathway might
also be deregulated in NF1-deficient cells.

The mTOR pathway is aberrantly regulated in Nf1⫺/⫺ MEFs. (A)

cated. (B) Western blot analysis of primary Nf1⫹/⫹ and Nf1⫺/⫺ MEFs deprived

The most commonly used in vivo readout of mTOR activation
is the phosphorylation of a well characterized substrate, S6
kinase (S6K1), at T-389. Phosphorylation at this site depends on
mTOR and is required for maximal S6K1 activation. Serum-
starved wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhib-
ited little activation of AKT or S6K1 (Fig. 1A). However, AKT
was aberrantly activated in serum-deprived Nf1-null MEFs.
Notably, S6K1 was also hyperphosphorylated in these cells in the
absence of any growth factors. The aberrant activation of S6K1
was inhibited by rapamycin, demonstrating its dependence on
mTOR. We also examined whether amino acid deprivation
would inhibit mTOR activation in Nf1-deficient cells. Consistent
with the observation that nutrients integrate into the mTOR
pathway downstream of PI3 kinase activation, amino acid with-
drawal resulted in the appropriate termination of the mTOR
signal in both wild-type and Nf1-deficient cells (Fig. 1B). Thus,
neurofibromin deficiency specifically results in the deregulation
of the mTOR pathway in response to growth factor deprivation.
Because neurofibromin is a RasGAP, we investigated whether
the aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway in Nf1-deficient
cells depended on the inappropriate activation of Ras. Notably,
we and others have previously shown that Ras-GTP levels are
deregulated in Nf1-deficient cells (5–7, 23). We therefore sought
to determine whether expression of only the catalytic GRD of
neurofibromin would be sufficient to suppress the observed
defect in S6K1 activation. This fragment has previously been
reported to rescue specific defects associated with Nf1-deficiency
and dramatically suppressed Ras activation (Fig. 2A Left) (23).
Moreover, it restored the level of phospho-S6K1 in Nf1-deficient
cells to levels equivalent to those observed in wild-type cells
under the same conditions (Fig. 2 A Right). These results indicate
that the hyperactivation of this pathway in Nf1-deficient cells
depends on the absence of its RasGAP activity, rather than an
additional uncharacterized function of neurofibromin.

Although the overexpression of an oncogenic Ras allele can
induce S6K1 activation (24), the extent to which Ras normally
participates in regulating mTOR in the context of growth factor
signaling has been debated. Notably, growth factor receptors can
activate PI3 kinase via Ras-dependent and independent mech-

levels in wild-type cells, this reagent was also used to determine
whether Ras activation is required for maximal activation of the
mTOR pathway in response to various growth factors. Impor-
tantly, the GRD significantly attenuated AKT activation and
blunted S6K1 activation in response to LPA in wild-type cells
(Fig. 2B). It also inhibited S6K1 phosphorylation in response to
insulin. Finally, the GRD had no effect on PDGF-induced
mTOR activation, consistent with previous reports (25). Inter-
estingly, in response to LPA and insulin the GRD appeared to
have the most dramatic effect on AKT and S6K1 at later time
points, rather than immediately after growth factor treatment.
This finding may suggest that Ras-independent mechanisms of
PI3 kinase activation are important for the initial activation of
this pathway, whereas Ras is required for a more sustained
activation. This model is consistent with the fact that Ras-
independent activation of PI3 kinase occurs more proximal to
receptor activation than Ras-dependent activation of its effec-
tors, in both receptor tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled
receptor signaling. Regardless, these data indicate that Ras
activation is differentially required for maximal activation of the
mTOR pathway in response to growth factors.
To determine whether the inappropriate activation of mTOR
in Nf1-deficient cells depended on the Ras兾PI3 kinase effector
pathway, we examined S6K1 phosphorylation in Nf1-deficient
cells in the presence of the PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin. We
found that wortmannin dramatically reduced AKT activation
and S6K1 phosphorylation in serum-deprived Nf1-deficient cells
(Fig. 3A). The primary target of AKT in this pathway is thought
to be tuberin, which in response to insulin is phosphorylated at
two distinct sites, T-1462 and S-939, by this kinase (26–28). AKT
phosphorylation of tuberin has been shown to inactivate the
TSC1兾TSC2 complex, resulting in the subsequent activation of
Rheb and mTOR, through an unknown mechanism (29–32).
Importantly, in Nf1-deficient serum-starved cells tuberin was
constitutively phosphorylated at T-1462 and S-939, in contrast to
wild-type cells where phosphorylation was minimal under these
conditions (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation at these sites was also
suppressed in the presence of wortmannin (Fig. 3A). Finally, a
mutant TSC2 gene, encoding alanine substitutions at T-1462 and
S-939, suppressed mTOR activation in Nf1-deficient cells
(Fig. 3B).

To determine whether NF1-deficient tumors from NF1 pa-
tients similarly exhibit an aberrant activation of the mTOR
pathway, we examined this pathway in NF1⫹/⫺ and NF1⫺/⫺
Schwann cells derived from human neurofibromas. Neurofibro-
mas are known to be extremely heterogenous lesions (1). Based
on genetic studies of human tumors as well as mouse modeling
data, it is believed that neurofibromas develop in NF1 patients
as a result of ‘‘second hit’’ mutations in Schwann cells or
Schwann cell precursors, which then act as a seed population to
recruit other cells (NF1⫹/⫺ Schwann cells, fibroblasts, mast cells,
and perineurial cells) into a developing lesion (20, 33–37).
Methods for isolating Schwann cells and then further separating
NF1⫹/⫺ Schwann cells from NF1⫺/⫺ Schwann cells have been
well described (20, 21). We obtained matched NF1⫹/⫺ and
NF1⫺/⫺ Schwann cells from one cutaneous and one plexiform
neurofibroma. In both cases S6K1, AKT, and tuberin phosphor-
ylation was significantly higher in the NF1-null cells as compared
with the matched NF1⫹/⫺ cells (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, S6K1
phosphorylation was blocked by wortmannin, indicating that the
aberrant activation of the PI3 kinase pathway underlies the
activation of mTOR in these tumor cells (Fig. 4B).

It is commonly believed that tumors become dependent on the
dysregulation of a specific signaling pathway and are therefore
hypersensitive to its down-regulation (38, 39). To determine
whether NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors have
become dependent on hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway,
we tested the effects of rapamycin on tumors from NF1 patients.

anisms, the redundancy of which has been a conundrum in the
field. Nevertheless, the Ras-independent PI3 kinase pathway is
assumed to be the primary mTOR activation signal, and Ras is
generally excluded from discussions of this pathway entirely (10,
11). This exclusion may partially be attributed to earlier studies
suggesting that Ras was not required for mTOR activation in
response to PDGF (25). However, it is plausible that different
growth factors might preferentially engage one pathway versus
the other. Furthermore, in vivo where growth factors are likely
to be limiting, both pathways may be required to elicit maximal
mTOR activation and a subsequent biological response. In any
case, the requirement for physiological levels of Ras activation
in regulating the mTOR pathway has not been thoroughly
elucidated.

The observation that neurofibromin-deficiency results in con-
stitutive mTOR activation indicates that the activation of en-
dogenous Ras can stimulate this pathway. Because expression of
the GRD of neurofibromin dramatically inhibited Ras-GTP

prevalent, ⬎10 times more prevalent than most other phakoma-
totic disorders, and even more common than TSC, a disease for
which the effects of rapamycin are currently being assessed in
clinical trials.

We also found that tuberin mediates the effects of NF1-
deficiency on mTOR. Although AKT has been shown to be
activated in Nf1-deficient cells, the critical pathogenic targets of this
kinase in NF1-associated tumors were unknown (41). We have
demonstrated that tuberin is a target of AKT in human tumors
derived from NF1 patients. Furthermore, inactivation of tuberin by
AKT is absolutely required for mTOR activation in Nf1-deficient
cells. These data identify NF1 as a new player in the cascade of
tumor suppressors and oncogenes involved in mTOR activation.
We have previously shown that neurofibromin is rapidly degraded
in response to growth factors, and that its reappearance is required
to appropriately terminate the Ras signal in wild-type cells (7).
Therefore, it is likely that neurofibromin plays an active role in
appropriately regulating this signal in response to growth factors. In
any case, these data demonstrate that neurofibromin is indispens-
able for the appropriate suppression of the mTOR signal in the
absence of mitogenic stimuli.

In addition, although the activation of mTOR in response to
growth factors was known to be PI3 kinase-dependent, the extent
to which Ras participates in this process was unknown. By using
Nf1-deficient cells we were able to uniquely determine that the
activation of endogenous Ras, via the loss of neurofibromin,
results in pathogenic levels of mTOR activation. Furthermore,
we also showed that in wild-type cells, Ras activation is required
for maximal mTOR activation in response to LPA and insulin.
Although this may be a subtle point, the amplitude and duration
of Ras effector pathways has been shown to be critical for
specifying biological responses (42). Therefore, it is possible that
threshold levels of mTOR activation are not achieved in the
absence of a Ras signal, which may have important biological
consequences in certain settings. Interestingly, Ras activation
does not appear to be required in response to PDGF, indicating
a differential role for this pathway in response to different
growth factors.

Finally, rapamycin derivatives have been suggested as poten-
tial therapeutic agents for a variety of cancers (43, 44). In
particular, it has been suggested that these drugs may be useful
in combination with other small-molecule inhibitors (43). The
basis for this suggestion is that multiple genes are mutated in
tumors; therefore, inhibition of more than one pathway may be
required for a therapeutic effect. On this basis neurofibromatosis
type I may represent a uniquely treatable disease. Notably,
benign symptoms, such as neurofibromas, can be quite severe.
However, they are likely to occur from the mutation of a single
gene: NF1. Therefore it is possible that rapamycin derivatives
may represent a single-hit therapy for these lesions, either by
preventing tumor development and兾or promoting their regres-
sion. Thus, these agents may represent one of the first viable
therapies for this untreatable and devastating tumor-type. How-
ever, this benefit is likely to extend beyond peripheral nerve
sheath tumors to include other NF1 symptoms. Recently, the
mTOR pathway has been shown to be activated in a high
percentage of acute myeloid leukemias (in patients that do not
have NF1) (45). Furthermore, these patients appear to respond
to rapamycin, suggesting that the aberrant activation of mTOR
is also critical for the development of this tumor type. These
observations,
in conjunction with our data demonstrating a
direct connection between NF1 and mTOR, support the possi-
bility that these agents will also be useful in treating NF1-
associated myeloid malignancies.

As an independent means of assessing the effects of rapamycin
on the tumorigenic properties of NF1-deficient cells, we estab-
lished a genetically engineered cell system. Cellular transforma-
tion is known to require multiple genetic events affecting the Rb,
p53, and Ras pathways (40). In MEFs, the combined expression
of a dominant-negative p53 gene and the E1A oncogene, which
binds and inactivates Rb family members, is not sufficient to
promote growth in soft agar. However, we found that in the
absence of Nf1, cells expressing these genes did form colonies in
soft agar (Fig. 5A). Importantly, rapamycin dramatically sup-
pressed colony growth at low concentrations in this system as
well (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results suggest that NF1-
deficient tumor cell lines are exquisitely sensitive to rapamycin
and suggest the potential therapeutic utility of rapamycin or its
derivatives in treating PNS tumors in NF1 patients.

Discussion
In this article we have shown that the mTOR pathway is critically
deregulated in NF1-deficient primary cells and human tumors.
Importantly, PNS tumors derived from NF1 patients are highly
sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, suggesting that it or
its derivatives might be useful therapeutically. To date there is no
effective treatment or cure for NF1. The hallmark neurofibro-
mas, even when benign, can be painful, debilitating, and can
grow large enough to encompass an entire body region (1). In
addition to a high tumor burden encumbered by some patients,
many cannot be surgically resected because of underlying nerve
involvement. Furthermore, lesions that are surgically reduced
typically regrow. Therefore, the evidence that mTOR deregu-
lation participates in NF1-related tumorigenesis may represent a
therapeutic breakthrough for this disease. Notably, NF1 is quite
