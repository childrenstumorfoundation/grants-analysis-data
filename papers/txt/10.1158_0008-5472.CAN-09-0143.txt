Abstract
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) develop
in ∼10% of neurofibromatosis type-1 patients and are a major
contributing factor to neurofibromatosis-1 patient mortality
and morbidity. MPNSTs are multidrug resistant, and thus
long-term patient survival rates are poor after standard doxo-
rubicin or multiagent chemotherapies. We show that the hya-
luronan receptor CD44 forms complexes with multidrug
transporters, BCRP (ABCG2) and P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), in
the plasma membrane of human MPNST cells. Small hyaluro-
nan oligosaccharides antagonize hyaluronan-CD44–mediated
processes and inhibit hyaluronan production. Treatment of
MPNST cells with the hyaluronan oligomers causes disassem-
bly of CD44-transporter complexes and induces internaliza-
tion of CD44, BCRP, and P-glycoprotein. Consequently, the
oligomers suppress drug transporter activity and increase
sensitivity to doxorubicin treatment in culture. In vivo, sys-
temic administration of hyaluronan oligomers inhibits
growth of MPNST xenografts. Moreover, the oligomers and
doxorubicin act synergistically in vivo, in that combined sub-
optimal doses induce tumor regression to a greater extent
than the additive effects of each agent alone. These findings
indicate that constitutive hyaluronan-CD44 interactions con-
tribute to drug transporter localization and function at the
plasma membrane, and that attenuating hyaluronan-CD44 in-
teractions sensitizes MPNSTs to doxorubicin in vitro and
in vivo. These results also show the potential efficacy of hya-
luronan oligomers, which are nontoxic and nonimmunogenic,
as an adjuvant for chemotherapy in MPNST patients. [Cancer

Introduction

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, neu-
ro-cutaneous disorder with an estimated incidence of 1:2,500 to
1:3,000 people worldwide (1, 2). The absence of neurofibromin in
NF1 causes an array of clinical manifestations, including tumors
such as gliomas, neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, and ma-
lignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). MPNSTs arise in
∼10% of patients with NF1 and are a major contributing factor to
NF1 patient mortality and morbidity. MPNSTs are believed to arise

either spontaneously or from preexisting neurofibromas, which are
benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors composed primarily of
Schwann cells and fibroblasts. In contrast, MPNSTs are rapidly
growing, spindle-cell sarcomas that infiltrate surrounding tissues
and frequently metastasize to the lungs, lymph nodes, and liver.
Moreover, MPNSTs are characteristically resistant to therapy. Sur-
gical resection, local radiotherapy, and doxorubicin or multiagent
chemotherapy are mainstays of MPNST treatment, but long-term
survival rates are poor (3, 4).

Cancer cells exhibit multiple mechanisms of resistance to che-
motherapeutic agents, including enhanced drug efflux via the ATP-
binding cassette (ABC) family transporters (5–8). Hyaluronan, a
large extracellular glycosaminoglycan that is enriched in a variety
of tumors, including MPNSTs (9, 10), has been shown to influence
chemoresistance (11, 12). Interactions of hyaluronan with its major
cell surface receptor, CD44, increase resistance to numerous drugs
(13–18) and stimulate expression of the drug transporters, breast
cancer resistance protein/ABCG2 (BCRP; ref. 19), and P-glycopro-
tein/ABCB1 (Pgp; ref. 14). Moreover, CD44 interacts with Pgp in
tumor cell membranes (20, 21).

Disruption of constitutive hyaluronan-CD44 interactions sup-
presses multidrug resistance and malignant cell properties at sev-
eral different levels (e.g., through inactivation of receptor tyrosine
kinases, cell survival signaling pathways, and drug transporters;
ref. 12). In our previous studies, we have used several antagonists
of hyaluronan-CD44 interactions to probe their function in these
activities. For example, small hyaluronan oligosaccharides (o-HA)
compete with polymeric hyaluronan for binding to receptors such
as CD44 (22). Whereas polymeric hyaluronan binds to CD44 multi-
valently and with high affinity, o-HA containing 6 to 18 sugar re-
sidues bind monovalently and with low affinity (23). Prolonged
treatment of cancer cells with these o-HA inhibits drug transporter
expression and sensitizes the cells to drugs, including doxorubicin,
Taxol, vincristine, and methotrexate (13, 14, 18, 19). o-HA also in-
hibit hyaluronan production (24), presumably through interference
with interactions within the hyaluronan synthase apparatus, which
is also located at the plasma membrane (25).

In the present study, we examine interactions of CD44 with
BCRP and Pgp in the membrane of MPNST cells and the influence
of o-HA on transporter localization and function in these cells. We
find that CD44 associates with BCRP and Pgp at the plasma mem-
brane, and that treatment of MPNST cells with o-HA induces com-
plex disassembly and internalization of CD44, BCRP, and Pgp from
the membrane into the cytoplasm. Consequently, o-HA treatment
decreases doxorubicin resistance, inhibits efflux of the Pgp sub-
strate FURA 2-AM, and suppresses hyaluronan secretion. More-
over, using an MPNST xenograft model in nude mice, we show
that o-HA induce tumor regression and sensitize the tumors to

doxorubicin treatment in a synergistic manner. Together, these da-
ta indicate that constitutive, cell-autonomous interactions
between hyaluronan and CD44 contribute to ABC-family trans-
porter localization and function in vitro and in vivo, showing the
potential efficacy of o-HA as adjuvant therapy for drug-resistant
MPNSTs.

Materials and Methods

Cells and reagents. ST88-14 human MPNST cells were obtained from
Dr. Larry Sherman (Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR).
Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Atlas Biologicals. DMEM and
Ham's F12 were purchased from Sigma. Growth factor–reduced Matrigel
matrix was purchased from BD Biosciences. The following antibodies were
obtained for these studies: BCRP clone BXP-21 (Kamiya Biomedical Com-
pany), HCAM (DF1485; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FITC-tagged CD44 (Ce-
darlane Laboratories), Pgp (Calbiochem), β-actin (Sigma), goat anti-mouse
horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and goat anti-rabbit HRP (Chemicon). Alexa
Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 555, and Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibodies and
Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin were purchased from Invitrogen. DRAQ5 nuclear
stain was obtained from Biostatus Limited. Western blotting detection re-
agent (ECL) was purchased from Pierce. Cell proliferation assay reagent,
WST-1, was obtained from Takara Bio, Inc. FITC-labeled o-HA and hyalur-
onan polymer were generously donated by Anika Therapeutics. Unlabeled
hyaluronan oligosaccharides used in this study were a mixed fraction of
average molecular weight ∼2.5 × 103, composed of 2 to 10 disaccharide
units, that were fractionated from testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma, type
1-S) digests of hyaluronan polymer (Sigma, sodium salt); fractionation
was by trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by serial dialysis, using
membranes of Amicon Ultra Ultracel 5,000 MWCO (Millipore) and Spectra/
Por Membrane 1,000 MWCO (Spectrum Laboratories). All other chemicals
were of reagent grade or higher.

Cell culture. ST88-14 MPNST cells were cultured in DMEM/Ham's F12
with 2.38 g/L HEPES, 2 g/L sodium bicarbonate, and 10% FBS, pH 7.4, and
maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2-95% air incubator. For prepa-
ration of lysates, cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes 48 h before treatment
with o-HA. For preparation of confocal microscopy slides, cells were seeded
at low density in eight-well multichamber culture slides (BD Biosciences)
48 h before o-HA treatment.

Hyaluronan, WST, and FURA 2-AM assays. Hyaluronan levels were
assayed in conditioned medium by an ELISA-like assay (26). WST assay
was done according to the manufacturer's protocol. FURA 2-AM efflux
was measured as described (27): MPNST cells were seeded in 96-well plates
and incubated for 48 h before the experiment to a final density of ∼70%
confluence. Cell were treated −/+ 100 μg/mL o-HA in feed medium contain-
ing 2.5 μmol/L FURA 2-AM. Following a 2-h incubation, plates were read
(excitation, 340 nm; emission, 500 nm) in an FLx800 Microplate Fluores-
cence Reader (Biotek Instruments, Inc.) from the top and bottom to deter-
mine FURA 2-AM levels in the conditioned medium and cell layer,
respectively.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Following a 1-h in-
cubation with or without o-HA treatment, whole-cell lysates were prepared
for immunoprecipitation or direct immunoblotting as previously described
(28), and aliquots containing 50 or 500 μg of protein were solubilized in
SDS sample buffer for immunoblotting or used in immunoprecipitation,
respectively. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with the Catch and Re-
lease immunoprecipitation kit according to the manufacturer's specifica-
tions (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by immunoblot analysis as
previously described (28).

Confocal microscopy. Cells were plated, fixed, permeabilized, blocked
for nonspecific binding, incubated with the indicated antibodies, and
washed as previously described (28). Cells were then incubated with Alexa
Fluor secondary antibodies and Draq5 nuclear stain or Alexa Fluor phalloi-
din for 2 h. Slides were processed as described (28) and viewed on a Leica

MPNST xenografts. Following trypsinization and a PBS wash, 250,000
MPNST cells suspended in a 1:1 ratio of PBS to Matrigel (0.5 mL) were in-
jected s.c. into the flank of congenitally athymic nude mice (20–25 g
FOXn1nu strain) with a 23-gauge needle via a 0.5-cc syringe. Tumor growth
was measured in two dimensions with digital calipers every 48 h, and treat-
ment was begun when tumors exceeded 40 mm2. I.p. treatments in a con-
stant volume of 200 μL PBS buffer were delivered every 48 h via a 28-gauge
needle and 0.5-cc syringe for a course of 16 d.

Results

Suppression of drug resistance in MPNST cells by hyaluro-
nan oligomers. Complementary to our previous findings with oth-
er types of cancer cells (13, 14, 19), we show here that o-HA decrease
resistance to doxorubicin in MPNST cells (Fig. 1). One mechanism
whereby hyaluronan might influence drug resistance is through ef-
fects on multidrug transporter activity. Therefore, we measured the
effect of o-HA on efflux of FURA 2-AM, a fluorescent substrate for
Pgp. In cells expressing ABC transporters, intact FURA 2-AM is rap-
idly transported out of the cell, whereas it is cleaved to FURA 2 and
accumulates in the cytosol in the absence of ABC transporters (27,
29). Thus, transporter activity is inversely proportional to accumu-
lation of cytosolic FURA 2 fluorescence. We found that o-HA
treatment caused an increase in intracellular fluorescence and a
reduction of fluorescence in the medium of cultured MPNST cells
(Fig. 2), indicating that the oligomers inhibit Pgp transporter
activity.

As stated above, it is known that o-HA compete for interaction
between polymeric hyaluronan and its receptors (22, 23). However,
recent results indicate that o-HA also inhibit hyaluronan produc-
tion or secretion (24) and that hyaluronan may be secreted
through multidrug transporters (30). Therefore, we examined the
effect of o-HA on the level of hyaluronan secreted by MPNST cells.
The o-HA reduced secreted hyaluronan in a dose-dependent fash-
ion, with almost complete inhibition at 10 to 100 μg/mL (Fig. 3),
amounts found previously to inhibit drug resistance and signaling
events downstream of hyaluronan-CD44 interactions (13, 14, 19).

previous study showed that monocarboxylate transporters prefer-
entially associate with variant forms of CD44 (28). In addition, the
greater effects of o-HA seen in the CD44 immunoprecipitations
compared with the BCRP or Pgp immunoprecipitations are most
likely due to different antibody sensitivities, implying that disas-
sembly of the complexes is not complete under the conditions
used. This conclusion is supported by the confocal microscopy re-
sults presented below.

Internalization of CD44 and multidrug transporters by
treatment of MPNST cells with hyaluronan oligomers. To fur-
ther explore interactions between CD44 and BCRP or Pgp, we ex-
amined the localization of each protein by confocal microscopy. In
Fig. 5, we show that CD44 is colocalized with BCRP (Fig. 5A, a) and
Pgp (Fig. 5B, a) at the plasma membrane of MPNST cells (coloca-
lization: yellow signal). For comparison, image e of Fig. 5A and B
shows BCRP or Pgp alone, and image c of Fig. 5A and B shows
CD44 alone at the cell membrane. These results, together with
those in the previous section, indicate that CD44 interacts directly
or indirectly with BCRP and Pgp at the plasma membrane of
MPNST cells.

The immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that treatment
with o-HA may decrease interactions between CD44 and drug
transporters. Thus, we examined the influence of o-HA on the lo-
calization of CD44, BCRP, and Pgp. After treatment of MPNST cells
with o-HA for 1 h, followed by fixation and processing for confocal
microscopy, we found that each of these three plasma membrane
components became localized in the cytoplasm and that internal-
ization was accompanied by a significant but not complete loss of
colocalization of CD44 and the ABC transporters in the cell mem-
brane (Fig. 5A and B—b, d, and f). Quantitative pixel analyses re-
vealed ∼3-fold more colocalization of CD44 and BCRP over the
whole cell and 60-fold more colocalization in the plasma mem-
brane of untreated cells when compared with o-HA–treated cells.
Similarly, we found 25-fold more colocalization of CD44 and Pgp
over the whole cell and 400-fold more colocalization in the plasma
membrane of untreated cells than in o-HA–treated cells.

Methods. Columns, mean of triplicate wells; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, significant

These results led us to examine the effects of o-HA on ABC trans-
porters in MPNST cells more closely.

CD44-multidrug transporter interactions in MPNST cells.
We chose to study the effects of o-HA on CD44 interactions with
two transporters (i.e., BCRP and Pgp) because we showed that pro-
longed (24 hours) o-HA treatment decreases their expression
(13, 14, 19) and because Pgp has been shown to interact with
CD44 by other investigators (20, 21). In addition, chemotherapeutic
drugs currently used in treatment of MPNSTs are substrates of
these transporters.

First, we analyzed lysates of MPNST cells for the presence of
CD44, BCRP, and Pgp. As expected from previous publications
(10, 31), MPNST cells express high levels of standard CD44
(∼85 kDa) and lower but significant levels of variant CD44 isoforms
(>105 kDa; Fig. 4A). The MPNST cells also express both BCRP and
Pgp (Fig. 4A). The levels of expression of CD44, BCRP, and Pgp are
not significantly affected by treatment with o-HA for 1 h (Fig. 4A).
We then sought evidence for interactions between CD44 and the
transporters by performing immunoprecipitations from lysates of
the MPNST cells. Using antibody against CD44 for immunoprecip-
itation and subsequent immunoblotting with antibodies against
BCRP and Pgp, we found both transporters in the CD44 immuno-
precipitates (Fig. 4B). We also performed immunoprecipitations
with antibodies against BCRP (Fig. 4C) and Pgp (Fig. 4D), both of
which pulled down CD44. As previous work in our lab has shown
that signaling complexes containing CD44 and receptor tyrosine
kinases (32, 33) or monocarboxylate transporters (28) are dissoci-
ated by treatment of cells with antagonists of hyaluronan-CD44 in-
teraction, we determined whether o-HA also affect interactions
between CD44 and BCRP or Pgp. Treatment of MPNST cells with
o-HA for 1 h decreased the amounts of BCRP and Pgp that ap-
peared in the complexes immunoprecipitated with CD44 antibody
(Fig. 4B). Complementary immunoprecipitations with BCRP (Fig.
4C) or Pgp (Fig. 4D) also showed a modest but consistent decrease
in the amount of CD44 complexed with these transporters after
treatment of the cells with o-HA for 1 h. As noted previously
(28), we have found that the “pan”-CD44 antibody used for immu-
noprecipitation is somewhat inefficient and variable in its ability to
pull down variant forms of CD44, even though it recognizes them
clearly in immunoblots. This may explain some of the variability
observed in these immunoprecipitations, especially because our

To confirm that internalization of CD44 in response to treat-
ment with o-HA was an active cellular process, we treated live cells
with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated CD44 antibody in the absence or
presence of o-HA for an hour before fixation. Following fixation, we
also stained actin filaments with phalloidin. As in the previous ex-
periments wherein CD44 antibody staining was done after fixation
(Fig. 5A and B), we observed that CD44 became localized within
the cytoplasm following oligomer treatment (Fig. 5C, b and d ver-
sus a and c). Image a of Fig. 5C also shows colocalization of CD44
with phalloidin-stained cortical actin.

As a control for nonspecific charge effects of o-HA, we compared
treatment of living cells with FITC-tagged o-HA versus FITC-
tagged hyaluronan polymer, followed by fixation and staining for
CD44 and the nucleus (Fig. 5D). FITC-tagged o-HA treatment for
1 h induced internalization of CD44 (Fig. 5D, h), whereas treatment
with FITC-tagged hyaluronan polymer for 1 h gave results that
were indistinguishable from the FITC control (Fig. 5D, i versus
g). Interestingly, FITC-tagged o-HA was internalized to a perinuc-
lear region of the cytoplasm (Fig. 5D, e) in association with CD44
(Fig. 5D, b and h; note perinuclear yellow signal in b). In contrast,
FITC-tagged hyaluronan polymer remained primarily at the cell

(50 μg/lane) reveals strong expression of standard CD44 (S; ∼85 kDa) and lower
levels of splice variants (V; >105 kDa). The MPNST cells express both BCRP
and Pgp. Expression of these proteins was not affected significantly by o-HA
treatment. B to D, immunoprecipitations (IP) were carried out with antibodies
against CD44 (B), BCRP (C), or Pgp (D) from lysates of MPNST cells treated −/+
o-HA. Western blot analysis of BCRP, Pgp, and CD44 was done, as indicated
(arrows, positions of BCRP and Pgp bands). BCRP and Pgp were observed in
the CD44 immunoprecipitate; CD44 was observed in both BCRP and Pgp
immunoprecipitates. Treatment with o-HA caused a consistent decrease in the
coimmunoprecipitated components. Representative blots of three or more

Synergistic induction of MPNST xenograft regression by sys-
temic administration of hyaluronan oligomers and doxorubi-
cin. To explore the ability of o-HA to affect MPNST growth in vivo,
we established s.c. MPNST xenografts in the flanks of nude mice.
Initial experiments revealed that a single intratumoral (i.t.) injec-
tion of o-HA, at doses as low as 0.5 mg/kg, suppressed tumor
growth (data now shown). Subsequently, using i.p. injections, we
compared the effects on MPNST growth of various concentrations
of o-HA alone, doxorubicin alone, and o-HA in combination with
doxorubicin, delivered every 48 hours for 2 weeks. In Fig. 6A, we
show that a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of o-HA suppresses tumor growth
and that 5 mg/kg causes tumor regression. However, doses higher
than 5 mg/kg [i.e., 50 mg/kg (not shown) and 250 mg/kg (Fig. 6A)]
did not seem to increase tumor regression significantly beyond
that obtained with 5 mg/kg. In Fig. 6B, we show that a dose of
1 mg/kg doxorubicin results in a small degree of tumor regression,
and that increasing the dose to 5 mg/kg has little additional effect.
Finally, in Fig. 6C, we show that combined suboptimal doses of
o-HA (0.5 mg/kg) and doxorubicin (1 mg/kg) result in significant
tumor regression, exceeding the additive effects of each agent
alone or the individual effects of a 10-fold greater dose of o-HA
alone or 5-fold greater dose of doxorubicin alone. These results, to-
gether with our in vitro data, strongly point toward a synergistic
effect wherein o-HA sensitizes MPNST cells to doxorubicin by de-
creasing drug efflux.

Discussion

In this study, we have found that CD44 associates with the drug
transporters, BCRP and Pgp, in the plasma membrane of MPNST
cells. We also showed that an antagonist of hyaluronan-CD44 in-
teractions (i.e., o-HA) induces disassembly of these complexes,
inhibits transporter function, and decreases resistance to doxoru-
bicin in MPNST cells in vitro and in vivo.

Previous studies by other laboratories have shown interrela-
tionships between CD44 and Pgp. Using confocal microscopic co-
localization and fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies in
NIH-3T3 cells, Pgp and CD44 were found to interact within plas-
ma membrane lipid microdomains (34). In addition, coimmuno-
precipitation of Pgp and CD44 has been shown with carcinoma
and melanoma cells (20, 21). In this study, we have shown by
coimmunoprecipitations and confocal microscopy that both
BCRP and Pgp are in close association with CD44 in the plasma
membrane of MPNST cells. We have previously shown that com-
plexes containing CD44 in association with ERBB2 and other sig-
naling moieties are present in lipid microdomains within the
plasma membrane of carcinoma cells, and that stimulation of hya-
luronan production induces assembly of these complexes (32).
Other investigators have documented analogous relationships of
hyaluronan-CD44 interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases
(35–38) and the Na+-H+ exchanger 1 (39). We have recently shown
a similar relationship with the monocarboxylate (lactate) transpor-
ters, MCT1 and MCT4 (28). These findings indicate that CD44 inter-
acts with a wide range of plasma membrane components and
facilitates their functions.

In the current study, we have shown that o-HA inhibit cellular ef-
flux of FURA 2-AM, a substrate for the ABC-transporter, Pgp, and
induce internalization of BCRP and Pgp into the cytoplasm. In par-
allel, the o-HA inhibit hyaluronan production, suggesting that o-HA

488–conjugated o-HA resulted in internalization of both CD44 (h) and Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated o-HA (e) and their colocalization (b) in the cytoplasm. Arrows, plasma

may act, at least in part, by interfering with plasma membrane–as-
sociated hyaluronan synthase activity and/or reducing hyaluronan
extrusion. Of interest in this regard is the observation that hyaluro-
nan might be secreted through multidrug transporters in vertebrate
cells (30, 40). These findings support a close relationship between
hyaluronan production or secretion and the activity of ABC family
drug transporters. Moreover, it is possible that inhibition of hyalur-
onan synthesis would decrease the level of CD44 occupancy and
thus induce or promote the events described herein. In previous
studies, we showed that both o-HA and CD44 siRNA inhibit drug
resistance (14). However, whereas o-HA reproducibly inhibit hyalur-
onan production, CD44 siRNA does not (24, 33), suggesting that the
effect on hyaluronan production is not necessary for inhibition of
drug resistance. On the other hand, we find that o-HA remain asso-
ciated with CD44 during its internalization (Fig. 5D). Thus, as previ-
ously proposed (11), o-HA most likely act by displacement of
endogenous hyaluronan polymer from CD44, replacing the endoge-
nous multivalent hyaluronan polymer-CD44 interaction with a
monovalent interaction between o-HA and CD44. Nevertheless, it

is still possible that inhibition of synthesis amplifies the effects of
the o-HA, and this possibility is being investigated.

Multivalent interactions between hyaluronan and CD44 may be
necessary for stabilization of transporter interactions within the
plasma membrane, and disruption of these interactions may then
lead to endocytosis. In this regard, we previously found that in-
hibition of endogenous hyaluronan-receptor interactions, using
o-HA, soluble hyaluronan-binding proteins, or siRNA against
CD44, results in disassembly and inactivation of receptor tyrosine
kinase-CD44 complexes (32, 33). Recent work shows that o-HA also
cause rapid internalization of the receptor tyrosine kinases, ERBB2
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).4 In similar fashion,
we have shown that o-HA induce disassembly of CD44-lactate trans-
porter complexes and internalization of both CD44 and the trans-
porters (28). It is possible that o-HA prevent the initial assembly

Hyaluronan Oligomers Chemosensitize Malignant NF-1 Tumors

of these complexes, rather than inducing disassembly and internal-
ization, and that the loss of transporters and other signaling compo-
nents from the cell surface is due to turnover. However, this
alternative seems unlikely because the effects of the oligomers on
internalization and function of drug transporters in the present
study take place within an hour; similar results were obtained with
lactate transporters (28). Current work is directed toward determin-
ing the fate of the transporters after treatment of the cells with o-HA.
These findings imply that hyaluronan-CD44 interactions stabi-
lize many plasma membrane complexes and that a common mech-
anism may be involved. It is unclear as yet whether stabilization of
a particular complex is due to unique interactions with a subpop-
ulation of variant CD44, effects on organization of membrane com-

partments such as lipid rafts, or influences of various components
within a hyaluronan-dependent pericellular matrix. Nevertheless,
our results herein indicate that CD44 resides in close molecular
vicinity to BCRP and Pgp, and that constitutive hyaluronan-CD44
interaction stabilizes these transporters and modulates their func-
tion in the plasma membrane.

Finally, by establishing a human MPNST xenograft model in
nude mice, we have been able to study the effects of o-HA on tu-
mor growth and drug resistance in vivo. Preliminary data indicated
that i.t. injection of o-HA results in significant inhibition of growth,
as found previously for several tumor types using i.t. or local Alzet
pump administration (19, 41, 42). However, we found in this study
that systemic delivery of o-HA, through i.p. injection, has a similar

MPNST xenografts were established in the
flank of nude mice and grown to an area
of 40 mm2. I.p. injections of various
concentrations of o-HA (A), doxorubicin (B),
or a combination of suboptimal doses of
both o-HA and doxorubicin (C) were
delivered every 48 h for 2 wk after growth to
40 mm2. Data are shown as fold changes
after the beginning of treatment. The
combination of suboptimal doses of o-HA
and doxorubicin (C) results in greater
inhibition of tumor growth than either
component individually or their additive
effects. Scatter plots compare the effects
of o-HA, doxorubicin, and o-HA plus
doxorubicin at 48-h increments over the
course of 2 wk. Bar graphs compare the

effect. Indeed, repeated doses of 500 μg/kg resulted in growth sup-
pression, and doses of 5 mg/kg or more resulted in tumor regres-
sion over a 2-week period. Importantly, systemic injection of
suboptimal doses of both o-HA (500 μg/kg) and doxorubicin
(1 mg/kg) caused MPNST tumor regression to a degree greater
than the additive effects of each reagent alone, and indicated a syn-
ergistic effect of the two agents.

In summary, our findings support a model in which constitutive
hyaluronan-CD44 interaction stabilizes transporter interactions
and activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in enhanced
multidrug resistance. Our preclinical study with MPNST xenografts
indicates that treatment with o-HA, which are nontoxic and nonim-
munogenic, may be a novel and effective adjuvant to chemotherapy
in MPNST patients.
