Over 60 bromodomains belonging to proteins with very differ-
ent functions have been identified in humans. Several of them
interact with acetylated lysine residues, leading to the recruit-
ment and stabilization of protein complexes. The bromodo-
main and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins contain tandem
bromodomains which bind to acetylated histones and are
thereby implicated in a number of DNA-centered processes, in-
cluding the regulation of gene expression. The recent identifi-
cation of inhibitors of BET and non-BET bromodomains is one
of the few examples in which effective blockade of a protein–
protein interaction can be achieved with a small molecule. This

has led to major strides in the understanding of the function
of bromodomain-containing proteins and their involvement in
diseases such as cancer and inflammation. Indeed, BET bromo-
domain inhibitors are now being clinically evaluated for the
treatment of hematological tumors and have also been tested
in clinical trials for the relatively rare BRD-NUT midline carcino-
ma. This review gives an overview of the newest developments
in the field, with a focus on the biology of selected bromodo-
main proteins on the one hand, and on reported pharmacolog-
ical
including recent examples from

1. Introduction

Mammalian cells contain approximately two meters of linear
DNA which need to be packed in the nucleus. This is achieved
by association of the DNA with basic histone proteins to form
highly condensed chromatin.[1] Nucleosomes represent
the
basic subunit of chromatin and are essentially composed of
histone octamers formed of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 dimers
around which a DNA stretch of approximately 147 base pairs
forming 1.7 left-handed turns is wrapped.[2] Nucleosomes are
spaced by about 80 base pairs of linker DNA coated by histone
H1.[3]

Numerous direct DNA–protein interactions take place in the
nucleosome, with little specificity for the DNA sequence itself.
Histones, however, may undergo multiple reversible, covalent
post-translational modifications, mainly at their protruding N-
terminal tails, which strongly impact their interactions with
DNA and other histones.[4] The histone state affects all DNA-
centered processes, including genome architecture and integri-
ty, replication, repair, and gene transcription control.[5] Histone
modifications are very complex and include acetylation and
phosphorylation, which decrease the overall charge and there-
by loosen the association with DNA. Additional modifications
such as methylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, biotinylation,
citrullination, ribosylation, and crotonylation have also been
described.[6] Each can occur alone or in combination, and most
correlate with the overall chromatin state. Not all combinations
take place simultaneously, as some amino acids may undergo
several modifications (e.g.,
lysine residues can be acetylated,
methylated, or ubiquitylated) and some marks are present in
different forms (lysine mono-, di-, and trimethylation; arginine
symmetric and asymmetric dimethylation). Moreover, these
modifications may be short-lived, occur sequentially or
in
a context-specific manner. Some of this information can be
transmitted to daughter cells and is essential for epigenetic in-
heritance, for instance, for the maintenance of differentiated
states.[7] The importance of the histone code is further docu-
mented by the fact that a number of pathologies,
including

cancer, are linked to a deregulation of this information storage
system.[8]

The enzymes responsible for the addition of histone post-
translational modifications are collectively known as writers, of
which the most studied are the histone acetyltransferases
(HAT), histone methyltransferases (HMT), and kinases. Enzymes
that remove these marks are called erasers and include histone
deacetylases (HDAC), demethylases, and phosphatases. Impor-
tantly, the histone deacetylase inhibitors vorinostat and romi-
depsin have been approved for the treatment of cutaneous
T cell
lymphoma, whereas valproic acid is used in neurology
and psychiatry, underscoring the importance of histone acety-
lation status in various pathologies.[9] Histone methylation pat-
terns have also been linked to disease, mainly cancer. Recently,
the first histone methyltransferase inhibitors EPZ-6438 (target-
ing EZH2) and EPZ-5676 (targeting DOT1L) have shown effica-
cy in preclinical tumor models, which led to the initiation of
clinical studies.[10] Altogether, these recent advances show that
aberrations in histone post-translational modifications are
linked to several pathologies and that several of the enzymes
involved represent tractable drug targets.

Readers of histone marks often serve as platforms for the re-
cruitment of a number of partners, thus forming large com-
plexes with various cellular functions.[11] The interactions be-
tween reader proteins and histone marks are very specific and
are further influenced by neighboring histone modifications,
hence the concept of a histone code.[4a] Numerous studies indi-
cate that individual local variations may have a dramatic effect
on the binding of reader proteins, which in turn impacts the
molecular outcome of the corresponding interactions.[12]

Blocking protein–protein interactions is generally challeng-
ing, and few examples of small molecules that can achieve this
while maintaining appropriate pharmacokinetic properties
have been reported. This is why the druggability of reader pro-
teins has originally been considered low. However, the situa-
tion has dramatically changed following the discovery of small-
molecule inhibitors of bromodomains, which are readers of his-
tone acetylation marks.[13]

acetylation marks which, together with neighboring amino
acids, mediate binding selectivity, bromodomain-containing
proteins engage in a variety of biological functions.[15] They are
highly conserved from humans to yeast, indicating a fundamen-
tal role in cellular processes. In line with this, deletion of bro-
modomain protein-encoding genes often results in early em-
bryonic death or severe malformations. A total of 61 bromodo-
mains found in 46 different proteins has been identified in the
human proteome.[16] They form eight subfamilies with very dif-
ferent functions, and several of them have been implicated in
human diseases, mainly cancer and inflammation.[17]

The understanding of the biology of bromodomain proteins
has been facilitated by the recent identification of specific,
small-molecule inhibitors. Bromodomains usually possess deep
hydrophobic pockets with a small, tight binding site for the
acetyllysine moiety. In addition, water molecules present at the
bottom of the pocket have a significant impact on druggabili-
ty. The interaction between bromodomains and acetylated pro-
teins is also generally weak (low micromolar to millimolar KD
values), increasing the likelihood that potent inhibitors can be
found.[17] Druggability assessment shows that the BET sub-
group scores high within the bromodomain family,[18] which is
confirmed by the identification of several potent small-mole-
cule inhibitors with different scaffolds.[13] More recently, the
first potent inhibitors of other bromodomain proteins such as
cAMP response element binding protein-1 binding protein
(CREBBP), E1A-associated protein p300 (EP300) and bromodo-
main adjacent to zinc finger domain (BAZ) have been reported.
In this review, we outline new findings related to the biology
of bromodomain proteins with a focus on those that may play
an important role in cancer. We also review the pharmacologi-
cal inhibitors that have recently been described for several of
them and discuss their potential
impact on future disease
treatment.

2. Biology

2.1. BET subfamily

BET proteins are related to the Drosophila fsh gene, which
plays a major role in fly development. They derive their name
from the presence of two related tandem bromodomains
named BD1 and BD2, and of a unique extra-terminal region in
the C-terminal moiety. BET proteins are found in the cell nu-
cleus, where they bind via their two bromodomains to acety-
lated proteins, including histones H3 and H4. Detailed investi-
gations revealed important differences in the binding preferen-
ces of individual BET proteins to acetylated histone motifs.[16]
BET proteins also possess regions weakly reminiscent of kinase
motifs, hence their additional classification as atypical kinas-
es.[19] They are ubiquitously expressed (except the BRDT form,
see below) and play essential roles in epigenetic memory and
in maintaining chromatin architecture. They regulate cell-cycle
progression by controlling gene transcription. Interactions with
various viral proteins have furthermore been reported. Four
BET members are found in humans: BRD4, which acts as a mi-
totic bookmark and transcription facilitator; BRD3, which binds

BRD4 interacts with different transcription factors to regulate
downstream gene expression. It binds to acetylated RelA, thus
leading to stabilization of nuclear NF-kB and expression regula-
tion of genes involved in inflammatory processes.[31] Associa-
tion with the N-terminal region of the retinoid acid receptor a
for regulation of a discrete set of genes,[32] and with p53 lead-
ing to regulation of p21 expression, have also been ob-
served.[33]
In addition, BRD4 interacts with several chromatin
modifiers,
including the histone methyltransferase NSD3 and
the hydroxylase JMJD6.[34] BRD4 is an important regulator of
the expression of genes involved in S-phase progression. BRD4
target genes such as c-Myc, c-Fos, aurora B, cyclin D1, and cy-
clin D2 are all involved in cell-cycle control.[29, 33, 35] It was shown
very recently that BRD4 has an essential role in regulating
LMO2, which is involved in erythroid differentiation.[36] Interest-
ingly, blocking BRD4 function often results in only a transient
down-regulation of target genes, and normal
levels are ob-
served at 24 h or later. Recent data show that the short BRD4
isoform also participates in DNA damage signaling.[23] It inter-
acts with the condensin complex and attenuates H2AX phos-
phorylation, thus modulating the response to DNA damage. Fi-
nally, BRD4 is also implicated in the regulation of the apolipo-
protein A1 (ApoA1) gene,[37] thereby modulating the levels of
high-density lipoproteins, which are involved in the pathology
of arteriosclerosis.[38]

Different regions essential for BRD4 function have been de-
scribed (Figure 1). Both bromodomains are required for recog-

to acetylated GATA1 and regulates erythroid target genes;
BRD2, a regulator of body energy balance; and BRDT, which is
expressed selectively in the testis and is essential for spermato-
genic gene expression. The unique function of each BET pro-
tein is furthermore evidenced by the very different phenotypes
of knock-out animals. BRD4-deficient mice die shortly after im-
plantation, whereas heterozygous animals exhibit
severe
growth defects due to decreased cell proliferation.[20] BRD2-de-
ficient mice die early during embryogenesis.[21] Surprisingly, hy-
pomorphic animals with a mutated BRD2 promoter develop
severe obesity, however with low blood glucose levels and ele-
vated glucose tolerance.[22] BRDT knock-out mice are viable,
but have major defects in spermatogenesis and are sub-fertile.
Data on BRD3-deficient mice have not been published yet. The
recent
inhibitors (see below) has
helped tremendously in the deeper understanding of the BET

BRD4 is the best-studied member of the BET family. There are
three isoforms expressed in humans: one long isoform of 1362
residues, and two shorter isoforms (722 and 796 residues) that
differ by a unique 75-residue coding exon at the C terminus.[23]
The corresponding gene maps
region
19p13.1. BRD4 is involved in epigenetic memory as a bookmark
that remains attached to chromosomes during cell division
and allows rapid reactivation of
target genes immediately after
mitosis completion.[24] The 722-
residue short isoform of BRD4 in-
teracts directly with the acetylat-
ed cyclin T1 subunit of the posi-
tive transcription elongation fac-
tor b (P-TEFb). However, pre-
dominantly via its P-TEFb inter-
acting domain (PID), the BRD4
long isoform binds to the P-TEFb
complex, releasing HEXIM1 and
7SK snRNA from the complex,
thus leading to the formation of
an active form.[25] The active
complex stimulates transcription
elongation by phosphorylation of the C-terminal end of RNA
polymerase II by cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9). BRD4 fur-
thermore interacts with the mediator complex, the replication
factor C,
and signal-induced proliferation-associated pro-
tein 1,[26] as well as with a number of viral proteins.[27] Genome-
wide studies indicate that BRD4 binding correlates with gene
expression and that beside promoter regions,
intergenic and
intragenic regions are also recognized.[28] BRD4 binding sites
are also concentrated in large super-enhancer regions charac-
teristic of oncogenic drivers.[29] Recent studies with the Droso-
phila homologue indicate that the short isoform is responsible
for transcriptional regulation, whereas the long isoform co-lo-
calizes with insulator proteins and is important for chromatin
architecture.[30]

nition of acetylated histones and other proteins. Concerning
the interaction with the P-TEFb complex, it was found that the
BD2 region binds to tri-acetylated cyclin T and that the ex-
treme C-terminal region containing the essential PID makes
contact with CDK9 and cyclin T1.[39]
Importantly, the PID is
absent in the short BRD4 isoforms.[25b] Interaction with replica-
tion factor C and signal-induced proliferation-associated pro-
tein 1 necessitates BRD4 BD2.[26b] A 12-residue-long region

al proteins involved in epigenetic modifications,
including
NSD3 and JMJD6.[34] Studies with the yeast orthologues show
that this region interacts with the general transcription factor
TFIID.[43] The serine-rich SEED motif is found next to the extra-
terminal region and is needed for binding of BRD2 to tran-
scription factors of the E2F family.[44] The large proline-rich
region is located in the C-terminal moiety and plays a role in
mesenchymal transition.[45] Recently, two regions involved in
the interaction with p53 were identified: the basic residue-en-
riched interaction domain BID and the acidic phosphorylation-
dependent interaction domain PDID, which contains several
putative phosphorylation sites.[33] Point mutations introduced
into each bromodomain allowed the identification of individual
amino acids implicated in BRD4 function. Biochemical and cel-
lular assays show that N140 and N433 in the first and second
bromodomain, respectively, which form hydrogen bonds with
acetyllysine, as well as Y139 and Y432, are essential for chro-
matin interaction.[46] A putative ATP binding site has been de-
scribed,
in line with the potential kinase activity of BET pro-
teins.[19]

The understanding of the function of BRD4 was much im-
proved by the identification of potent BET-selective inhibitors
such as (+)-JQ1 ((+)-1) and I-BET762 (2) (Figure 2).[47] Crystal
structures show these inhibitors to mimic the acetyllysine

phoma,[35e] and multiple myeloma.[35b] Furthermore, a role in
solid tumors such as neuroblastoma,[53] glioblastoma,[54]
lung
cancer,[55] and melanoma[21] has been reported. The oncogenic
role of BRD4 is due, at least in part, to its role in regulating the
expression of a number of genes involved in the cell cycle, in-
cluding c-Myc and cyclin D1.[35d,e, 56] Apoptosis is furthermore
observed in cells treated with an inhibitor; however, higher
doses are required.[51b, 56]

Clinical studies have recently been initiated with different
BET inhibitors to evaluate their effect on NMC and hematologi-
cal tumors. Another pathology in which BRD4 is implicated is
inflammation, as evidenced by the protective role of the BET
inhibitor I-BET762 (2) against endotoxic shock and sepsis.[47b]
Another BET inhibitor named MS 417, which is structurally
almost identical to (+)-1 (having a methyl ester instead of
a tert-butyl ester moiety), decreased the expression of pro-in-
flammatory genes in tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa)-treated
kidney cells.[57] Recently, a role of BRD4 in cardiac hypertrophy
has also been proposed.[58] Finally, hijacking of BRD4 activity is
essential for the life cycle of a number of viruses,
including
herpes, papilloma, and the murine leukemia viruses.[59] These
viruses take advantage of the retention of BRD4 to the host
mitotic chromosomes for their propagation during cell divi-
sion.

2.1.2. BRD3

BRD3 is a 726-residue protein encoded by a gene lo-
cated at chromosome position 9q34. It was originally
reported to bind to genome regions that are hyper-
acetylated.[60] It interacts with GATA1, a transcription
role in hematopoiesis.[61]
factor with an essential
Binding of BRD3 to GATA1 is observed both at active
and inactive gene regions, and independent of the
acetylation status of histones. The interaction re-
quires acetylation of GATA1 and can be abrogated by
a point mutation in the first bromodomain of BRD3,
demonstrating the high selectivity of this protein–
protein interaction. Like other BET proteins, BRD3 in-
teracts with a number of viral proteins.[62]

group and to engage in similar interactions with individual
amino acids.[47a, 48] The studies also demonstrate that BRD4 is
implicated in a number of diseases. Chromosomal transloca-
tion leading to the expression of a fusion between BRD4 (or
BRD3) and the nuclear protein in testis (NUT) causes a rare
form of cancer known as NUT midline carcinoma (NMC).[49] Pa-
tient-derived NMC tumors are inhibited by BET-selective com-
pounds in in vivo xenograft models.[47a, 50] BRD4 also plays a cru-
cial role in a number of hematological tumors, including acute
myeloid lymphoma,[51] acute lymphoblastic leukemia,[52]
lym-

BRD2 was originally identified under the name RING3
as a mitogen-activated nuclear kinase.[63] There are
three main isoforms of 836, 801, and 754 residues,
and the corresponding gene maps near the major
histocompatibility complex genes at 6p21.3.[64] It is present in
several multiprotein transcriptional complexes that associate
with hyperacetylated chromatin regions and are involved in
cell-cycle progression.[60] In line with this, transgenic mice that
overexpress BRD2 in the lymphoid compartment develop lym-
phoma and leukemia.[65] Preferential binding of BRD2 to acety-
lated H4 and H2A.Z histones has been reported.[66] BRD2 inter-
acts with E2F transcription factors through a serine-rich
region.[44] BRD2-containing complexes regulate a number of
genes involved in cell proliferation including cyclin A and cy-

clin D1,[60, 67] and also androgen receptor (AR) target genes.[66]
An implication in the inflammatory response of macrophages
via direct binding to regulatory regions of cytokine genes has
furthermore been evidenced.[68] BRD2 is also involved in neuro-
nal differentiation via the E2F1 pathway.[69] A role in epilepsy
has been proposed, based on linkage studies and mice
models.[70] However, another study did not show a link be-
tween BRD2 and photosensitive epilepsy.[71] As mentioned
above, BRD2 hypomorphic mouse models are severely obese,
but are protected from glucose intolerance and insulin resist-
ance.[22, 72] This may be linked to epigenetically deregulated ex-
pression of genes involved in energy metabolism. An interac-
tion between BRD2 and proteins from different viruses includ-
ing the mouse herpes and human immunodeficiency viruses
has also been reported.[62, 73]

2.1.4. BRDT

The gene encoding the 947-residue-long BRDT protein maps
to chromosome region 1p22.1.[74] It is specifically expressed in
testis and plays an essential role in compacting the sperm
genome.[75] It binds to hyperacetylated H4 via its tandem bro-
modomains and is involved in the chromatin remodeling that
takes place during spermiogenesis.[76] It controls meiotic divi-
sions and post-meiotic repackaging of the genome.[77] In addi-
tion, BRDT regulates spermatogenic gene expression by acti-
vating or repressing a number of essential genes. Ablation of
the BRDT BD1 region leads to disrupted spermiogenesis and
sterility in mice.[78]
Interestingly, a number of RNA-splicing
genes are deregulated in the round spermatids of these ani-
mals. Together with the observed interaction between BRDT
and proteins involved in transcript maturation, this indicates
that beside the regulation of transcription, BRDT plays an addi-
tional role in mRNA alternative splicing.[78, 79] The crystal struc-
ture of BRDT BD1 reveals that it cooperatively recognizes two
histone acetylation marks.[80] This may also be true for other
bromodomains, suggesting that combinatorial readout of his-
tone marks may be a general feature of acetylation readers.

2.2. Non-BET bromodomain proteins

2.2.1. ATAD2

ATAD2 (also known as ANCCA) is a highly conserved protein
that belongs to the structurally highly diverse “ATPase associat-
ed with diverse cellular activities” family.[81] The ATPase region
is necessary for protein multimerization,[82] but little more is
known about its function. The C-terminally located bromodo-
main binds to several acetylated lysines on histones, including
H3K14ac[83] and H4K5ac,[82] allowing interaction with chromatin
and transcriptional regulation of target genes.

ATAD2 regulates the function of several transcription factors.
It is a co-activator of the AR, thus stimulating the expression of
a number of androgen target genes in prostate cancer cells.[84]
ATAD2 expression is itself stimulated by androgens,[85] and this
is mediated by an AR binding site located in the distal enhanc-
er region and by an E2F1 binding site in the promoter region

www.chemmedchem.org

of the ATAD2 gene, leading to cooperative activation by andro-
gens.[84a]
In addition, ATAD2 regulates the expression of the
H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2, which is one of the most
strongly up-regulated genes in prostate cancer.[85] Similar to
androgens, estrogens also stimulate ATAD2 expression, and
ATAD2 is a co-activator of the estrogen receptor (ER), which is
essential for the recruitment of further co-activators and for
histone hyperacetylation at estrogen target genes.[86] ATAD2
also binds to the c-Myc protein to stimulate its activity.[87] Co-
amplification of the ATAD2 and c-Myc genes which co-localize
to the 8q24.12 locus and concomitant overexpression have
been reported in several tumor types. This leads to the stimu-
lation of downstream genes related to cell proliferation and re-
sistance to apoptotic response,[87, 88] thereby implying an im-
portant function in tumor growth.

A role of ATAD2 in cancer is furthermore substantiated by
knock-down experiments. ATAD2 silencing in vitro is followed
by cell proliferation arrest,[84b] elevated sensitivity to cell-dam-
aging agents, and increased apoptosis.[82] Conversely, ATAD2
overexpression leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and loss
of a normal apoptotic cell response. In line with this, ATAD2 is
highly expressed in different tumors,
including lung, breast,
and endometrial cancer.[81, 82, 88, 89] In smokers, a driver function
for ATAD2 in lung cancer has been postulated.[88a] The related
ATAD2B form is also overexpressed in tumors,[90] but little is
known about its precise function.

Altogether,

role of
ATAD2 in reprogramming the genome toward a malignant
phenotype.[81] It alters chromatin dynamics, gene transcription
programs and the apoptotic response, thereby contributing to
multiple oncogenic processes. Selective inhibitors would fur-
ther help in the understanding of the biological function of
ATAD2, but have not yet been described.

2.2.2. PCAF

The p300/CBP-associated factor PCAF (also named KAT2B) pos-
sesses a lysine acetyltransferase function and contains a bromo-
domain, thereby combining a writer and reader function in
chromatin modification. It is part of a larger HAT complex with
an unusual catalytic mechanism.[91]
It modifies histone H3,
mainly at position K9, and histone H4,[92] thus regulating the
expression of numerous genes, including p21[93] and insulin.[94]
A role in controlling the expression of ribosomal genes and
miRNAs has also been reported.[95] The PCAF bromodomain
binds to the same acetyllysine position that is targeted by the
HAT region for acetylation.[96] By this, PCAF is poised to spread
the acetyl mark to neighboring histones, thereby reinforcing
transcriptional activation by a feed-forward mechanism.[97]

Beside histones, PCAF acetylates a number of transcription
factors including c-Myc,[98] b-catenin,[99] FOXO1,[100] Fli1,[101] and
p53,[102] with different outcomes. It also acetylates p27, thus af-
fecting the stability of this cell-cycle inhibitor.[103]

PCAF possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, enabling it to
ubiquitylate Hdm2[104] and Gli1.[105] Hdm2 participates in the
regulation of p53 levels, giving PCAF an additional, albeit indi-
rect, involvement in p53-mediated cell-cycle regulation.

PCAF overexpression is observed in central nervous system
tumors,[106] but conversely, decrease expression is observed in
esophageal[107] and gastrointestinal[108] cancers. A role of PCAF
in cell proliferation and invasion, and in drug resistance has
been reported in urothelial cancer cells.[109] Also, the overex-
pression of PCAF increases drug resistance of cisplatin-resistant
cells, via stimulation of E2F1 expression.[110] Inhibition of PCAF
acetyltransferase activity using high concentrations of isothia-
zolone ultimately leads to a decrease in proliferation of colon
and liver cancer cells.[111] Blocking bromodomain-mediated in-
teraction with chromatin and transcription factors has the po-
tential to block PCAF function as well. This has been success-
fully shown with arylpropane-diamine compounds for prevent-
ing interaction with the acetylated HIV Tat protein.[112]

2.2.3. CREBBP and EP300

CREBBP (KAT3A) and EP300 (also named p300 and KAT3B) are
general transcriptional co-activators with lysine acetyltransfer-
ase activity. They are highly homologous, share a similar
domain organization, and possess partly overlapping functions.
Both proteins are characterized by several zinc finger domains,
a bromodomain followed by a plant homology domain (PHD)
and a HAT domain, and a CREB binding domain.[113] They bind
to multiple partner proteins, mainly transcription factors and
other co-activators (reviewed by Wang et al.[113b]) and also to
several acetyllysines in histones.[96, 114] Binding preferences for
acetylated histones are different between CREBBP and EP300,
as observed in peptide binding assays.[16] CREBBP and EP300
play essential roles in histone acetylation, mainly at histone H3
positions K18 and K27.[114] Genome-wide studies show that
CREBBP and EP300 bind to active gene regions with high his-
tone acetylation but also to repressed regions, suggesting that
these proteins may mediate the switch between both chroma-
tin states.[115] A model for EP300 auto-acetylation and substrate
acetylation, based on the crystal structure of the catalytic core,
has recently been proposed.[116] CREBBP and EP300 are impor-
tant in DNA replication and repair, and also for regulation of
cell growth and genomic stability.[117] They are involved in the
control of genes from a number of signaling pathways.[118]

Depending on the context, CREBBP and EP300 may act as
oncogenes or tumor suppressors.[113b, 119] Their deregulation has
been associated with tumor growth. For instance, chromoso-
mal translocations giving rise to gene fusions between MOZ or
MLL and CREBBP or EP300 and including their respective bro-
modomains are reported in leukemias and lymphomas.[113b, 120]
In vitro experiments show that CREBP/EP300 is involved in cell-
cycle regulation[121] and in senescence.[122] As co-activators of
transcription factors such as c-Myc and AR, they may be impli-
cated in various
including prostate and colon
cancer.[123] Recently, an activating role of EP300 on T regulatory
cell function linked to tumor immunity has been evidenced.[124]
Finally, an implication in drug resistance has been reported.[125]
A role as tumor suppressor is suggested by several observa-
tions.[114] Patients with the Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome have
germline mutations of CREBBP or EP300 and an increased inci-
dence of hematological tumors.[126] Truncating EP300 muta-

colon, and pancreatic cancer.[127] It was also reported that het-
erologous CREBBP-deficient mice develop hematologic malig-
nancies.[128]

reviews, see Wang
et al.,[113b] Dekker and Haisma,[119b] and Heery and Fischer[129]).
Suppression of histone acetylation and of cell proliferation was
observed after treatment with various HAT inhibitors and in
vivo efficacy reported in breast cancer xenografts after treat-
ment with one compound.[130] Since then, and with the knowl-
edge that chromatin binding domains can be successfully tar-
geted for small-molecule inhibition, inhibitors of the bromodo-
mains of CREBBP and EP300 have been generated (see below).

2.2.4. BAZ family

Four members form the BAZ protein family: BAZ1A, BAZ1B,
BAZ2A, and BAZ2B.[131] They contain a PHD finger located near
a bromodomain in their C-terminal moiety, as well as a WAKZ
motif and several additional conserved regions. The presence
of a WAC motif in BAZ1A and BAZ1B, and of a ZB2 motif in
BAZ2A and BAZ2B led to a further sub-classification. The distri-
bution of BAZ transcripts is ubiquitous, however, with consid-
erable differences in expression levels.

BAZ1 proteins are found in chromatin-remodeling com-
plexes. BAZ1A (hACF1) is a component of the ACF nucleo-
some-remodeling complex which is involved in the chromatin
assembly process and in the regulation of nucleosome spac-
ing.[132] The ACF complex furthermore interacts with KU70 and
is needed for DNA double-strand break repair and for G2M
damage checkpoint.[133] BAZ1B (WSTF) was originally identified
due to its implication in the development disorder pathology
named Williams syndrome.[134] Indeed, some of the defects re-
ported in Williams syndrome are found in BAZ1B-deficient
mice.[135] BAZ1B belongs to a chromatin-remodeling complex
that mediates the activity of the vitamin D receptor.[135] BAZ1B
also has tyrosine kinase activity toward H2A.X and is involved
in the DNA damage response.[136] Additional
functions of
BAZ1B in chromatin assembly, RNA polymerase I and III gene
regulation or DNA repair, depending on the protein complex
to which it belongs, have been described.[137]

BAZ2 proteins may be involved in deregulated miRNA path-
ways in cancers of the prostate and ovary,[138] as well as in
chronic lymphocytic leukemia.[139] BAZ2A (also called TIP5 and
TTF5) is a component of the nucleolar remodeling complex
NoRC.[140] The ATPase SNF2h and BAZ2A are the main compo-
nents of this complex, which is essential for the silencing of
rRNA expression.
Interaction of NoRC with the DNA regions
coding for rRNA modifies the local histone marks and increases
DNA methylation, thus leading to transcriptional shutdown.
Binding of the BAZ2A bromodomain to acetylated nucleo-
somes and cooperation with the neighboring PHD finger
which binds to other chromatin modifiers including DNMTs,
HDAC1 and SNF2h, are necessary for NoRC function.[141] Differ-
ent BAZ2A regions play a role in nuclear matrix association, nu-

cleolar targeting, and DNA binding.[142] In addition, the NoRC
complex is implicated in the upkeep of high-order chromatin
structure at telomere and centromere regions of chromo-
somes.[140a] In line with this, silencing of BAZ2A expression is
followed by increased recombination between telomere re-
peats and chromosomal translocations.[143] Very little is known
about BAZ2B, although the histone binding preferences of the
bromodomain have recently been described.[144] A recent
genome-wide association study showed the BAZ2B locus is as-
sociated with sudden cardiac death.[145]

2.2.5. TRIM24, TRIM28, and TRIM33

TRIM24 (TIF-1a), TRIM28 (KAP1, TIF-1b), and TRIM33 (TIF-1g)
belong to the TIF1 family which is characterized by an N-termi-
nal tripartite motif, a nuclear receptor interaction box, and a C-
terminal PHD-bromodomain region.[146] The tripartite motif
comprises a RING finger domain also found in other E3 ligases,
followed by one or two B-boxes and a coiled-coil region. PHD
is a common motif in chromatin-associated proteins, and is
often a site of histone binding or other protein–protein inter-
actions. TRIM24, TRIM28, and TRIM33 mainly act as transcrip-
tional repressors, a function which requires the PHD-bromodo-
main as well as the E3 ligase functions. A tumor-suppressor
role in liver cancer has been reported, based on a knock-out
mouse model.[147] Homodimers as well as heterodimers and
heterotrimers of various TRIM proteins have been puri-
fied.[147, 148]

TRIM24 contains a bromodomain with the characteristic ace-
contacts
tyllysine
H3K23ac.[149] The neighboring PHD region interacts with un-
modified H3K4me0 within the same nucleosome, making the
two domains a single histone H3 binding module. TRIM24
overexpression contributes to faulty cell-cycle regulation and
uncontrolled cell proliferation. It binds to the ER and the AR,
leading to transcription stimulation of estrogen- or androgen-
dependent genes.[149, 150] TRIM24 is believed to recruit the ER
following an interaction with acetylated, unmethylated chro-
matin. Subsequently, estrogen-dependent genes are up-regu-
lated, enhancing cell proliferation and tumor progression. Ele-
vated levels of TRIM24 are associated with poor prognosis in
breast cancer.[149, 151] High TRIM24 expression is furthermore ob-
served in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,[152] acute
myeloid leukemia,[152] non-small-cell lung cancer,[153] and spora-
dic colorectal cancers. In addition, TRIM24 negatively regulates
p53 stability through ubiquitylation.[154] Knock-down of TRIM24
expression leads to apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and/or de-
creased cell proliferation likely by these and perhaps other
mechanisms in several tumor types.[152–154] On the other hand,
studies performed with knock-out mice suggest that TRIM24
acts as a tumor suppressor in the liver in the context of retino-
ic acid signaling.[147, 155] Indeed, a ligand-dependent interaction
of TRIM24 with the retinoic acid receptor has been shown.[156]
Interestingly, sexual dimorphic expression of the TRIM24 gene
was observed in mouse liver,[157] possibly linked to its regula-
tion by the female-specific liver transcription factor CUX2.[158]

www.chemmedchem.org

TRIM28 is found in a number of chromatin-remodeling com-
plexes, but does not directly bind to DNA.[159] Its atypical bro-
modomain shows no interaction with acetylated histones. It is
known to interact with KRAB-ZNF proteins, a very large family
of zinc finger proteins that regulate numerous cellular process-

genes without affecting their expression levels.[160] Several
studies indicate that TRIM28 acts as a transcription regulator,
mostly as a repressor. Following binding of TRIM28 to promot-
er regions, RNA polymerase II is removed, and active chromatin
marks are erased while a repressive H3K9me3 mark is written.
This necessitates sumoylation at several lysine residues of the
bromodomain mediated by the neighboring PHD region.[161]
TRIM28 negatively regulates IRF7 by sumoylation.[162] In addi-

phorylation by ATM, and may suppress DNA recombination.
Overexpression of TRIM28 in gastric cancer has been report-
ed.[163] Conversely, a tumor suppressor role in early lung cancer
has been postulated.[164]

TRIM33 binds to chromatin preferentially at unmodified
H3K4, methylated H3K9, and acetylated H3K18 and H3K23.[165]
After sumoylation at specific lysine residues,
it ubiquitylates
SMAD4 to repress its activity.[166] TRIM33 is reported to have
tumor suppressor functions and has roles in DNA repair.[167] It
is also involved in hematopoiesis by controlling the expression
of erythroid genes.[168]

3. Bromodomain inhibitors

3.1. BET inhibitors

3.1.1. Introduction

Since 2010, most of the work on developing small-molecule
bromodomain inhibitors has focused on the BET family of bro-
modomains.
In addition to the diseases discussed, potential
use of (+)-JQ1 ((+)-1) as a male contraceptive has been postu-
lated.[169]

I-BET762[170] (2, Figure 2) from GlaxoSmithKline (for the treat-
ment of NMC) as well as OTX015[171] (for the treatment of hem-
atological malignancies; structure not yet disclosed) from On-
coEthix (in-licensed from Mitsubishi Pharmaceuticals) and CPI-
0610[172] from Constellation Pharmaceuticals (for the treatment
of lymphomas; structure not yet disclosed) have entered clini-
cal trials, underscoring the therapeutic potential of this class of
inhibitors. The first BET bromodomain inhibitors were pub-
simultaneously by Filippakopoulos et al.[47a]
lished almost
(I-BET762, 2). Since
((+)-JQ1,
then, a number of different chemotypes have been described
as BET-selective bromodomain inhibitors, and are discussed in
greater detail in the following sections along with recent de-
velopments from the patent literature. A representative selec-
tion of reported inhibitors can be classified into the following
structurally diverse main classes: triazolodiazepines[47a,b, 48b] 1–3
and structurally related compounds (triazolotriazepines[46b] 5,
isoxazoloazepines[173] 4, and triazolodihydrodiazepines[174] 6;

(+)-1) and Nicodeme et al.[47b]

macokinetic properties required for in vivo efficacy were fur-
ther optimized by structure–activity relationship (SAR) investi-
gations, leading to compound 2 (Figure 2) with an improved
EC50 value of 700 nm in the reporter gene assay.[48b] SAR investi-
gations revealed the importance of the benzodiazepine core
and of the correct stereochemistry at the benzodiazepine 4-po-
sition for a high activity. All active analogues contained an aryl
group at the benzodiazepine 6-position, and a variety of
groups were tolerated at the 4-position, making this a useful
moiety for the modification of physicochemical and pharmaco-
kinetic properties. However, the molecular target was still un-
known and could not be identified by a screen against a panel
of known drug targets such as kinases, ion channels, nuclear
receptors, or G-protein-coupled receptors. Following a chemo-
proteomic approach, the cellular targets of compounds 2 and
3 were identified.[48b] Lysates from HepG2 human liver carcino-
ma cells were passed over an affinity matrix of the active ana-
logue 2 as well as a control matrix with an inactive analogue.
After extensive washing, a defined pattern of proteins was
identified by affinity chromatog-
raphy. These were retained on
the active matrix, but were
absent on the control matrix.
LC–MS/MS analysis revealed the
BET
proteins
BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 as molec-
ular targets of 2, and the poten-
cy of 2 was confirmed in a fluo-

No affinity for other bromodo-
mains was observed for com-
pound 2 by ITC.[48b] It was shown
that 2 suppressed the expression
of key pro-inflammatory genes
in an in vivo mouse model.[48b] In
it was demonstrated
addition,
that compound 2 inhibited cell growth in a panel of tumor cell
lines.[48b] As described very recently, I-BET762 (2) shows a good
preclinical profile,
including high in vitro permeability
(167 nm s 1), high solubility in physiologically relevant media
(> 3 mg mL 1), low potential to inhibit the major human cyto-
chrome P450 isoforms in vitro (IC50 > 33 mm), and low in vitro
clearance
(CLi <
1.7 mL min 1 g 1 liver; all species including humans).[47c, 182] The
pharmacokinetic profiles observed in mouse, dog, and primate,
and predicted in humans,
led to the selection of this com-
pound for further characterization.[47c, 182] In vivo studies dem-
onstrated the efficacy of 2 in several tumor and immune-in-
flammatory models so that I-BET762 (2) recently progressed
into the clinical development phase for oncology indica-
tions.[47c, 170, 182]

chemotypes

Methyltriazolodiazepine 3 (Figure 2) was one of the first selec-
tive BET bromodomain ligands and was discovered by using
a phenotypic screen to identify stimulators of ApoA1 expres-
sion, the up-regulation of which is associated with protection
from atherosclerosis progression and anti-inflammatory ef-
fects.[47b, 48b] Compound 3 was identified in a luciferase report-
er-based screen and showed an EC50 value of 440 nm for the
induction of the ApoA1 reporter gene. The potency and phar-

Amide formation with an l-aspartate derivative and
subsequent deprotection of the Fmoc group under
standard conditions yielded amine 24, which was cy-
clized under mild conditions to form the diazepine
core 25. Conditions for the formation of the triazole
ring were optimized to decrease racemization at this
late stage of the synthesis. Compound 25 was trans-
formed into a phosphorylimidate at low temperature
to activate the amide for nucleophilic attack by
acetic hydrazide. The initially obtained enantiomeric
purity (90 % ee) was increased to > 99 % by prepara-
tive chiral HPLC.

X-ray crystal structures of (+)-1 and 2 in complex
with BRD4(BD1) revealed nearly identical interactions,
with the methyltriazole moiety binding to the acetyl-
lysine (KAc) binding site of the protein (see Figure 5
for a simplified representation).[47a,b, 187] This binding
site comprises three distinct pockets, each forming
key interactions with the endogenous ligands. The 3-
methyl-1,2,4-triazole of (+)-1 and 2 acts as an acetyl-
lysine mimic, binding to the KAc binding pocket,
which is conserved in the majority of the bromodomains.[48b]
The methyl group of the triazole ring binds to a small hydro-
phobic pocket that is responsible for recognition of the acetyl
methyl group of the native acetyllysine ligand. The two adja-
cent nitrogen atoms of the 1,2,4-triazole ring mimic the car-
boxyl group of acetyllysine by one hydrogen bond interaction
with the side chain NH2 group of a conserved asparagine resi-
due (N140 in BRD4(BD1)) and another water-mediated hydro-
gen bond interaction with the hydroxy group of a conserved
tyrosine residue (Y97 in BRD4(BD1); Figure 5).

Compound 2 forms an additional hydrogen bond between
its amide NH and the carbonyl oxygen atom of N140 (Fig-
ure 5 b).[48b] The fused aromatic ring of the triazolodiazepine

amide 20 with phosphorus pentasulfide, was reacted with hy-
drazine followed by acetyl chloride to form an intermediate
acetylhydrazone, which was finally cyclized to triazole 21 in
acetic acid. Saponification and amide formation under stan-
dard conditions afforded enantiopure 2.

Another triazolodiazepine (+)-1 was reported as a BET bro-
modomain-selective ligand.[47a] It is structurally related to com-
pounds from a patent application filed by Mitsubishi Pharma-
ceuticals in which the inhibition of binding between an acety-
lated histone and bromodomain-containing protein BRD4 is
described.[183] By applying molecular modeling studies based
on the apo-crystal structure of the first bromodomain of BRD4,
Filippakopoulos et al. designed the thienotriazolodiazepine
(+)-1 as a prototype ligand.[47a] The bulky tert-butyl ester was
incorporated to avoid strong interactions with other known
benzodiazepine binding proteins. Similar to 2, only the S enan-
tiomer (+)-1 was active, as confirmed by ITC (KD = 49 nm,
(IC50 = 77 nm,
BRD4(BD1))
BRD4(BD1)). The selectivity of compound (+)-1 for the BET
bromodomain family was confirmed by differential scanning
fluorimetry. Compound (+)-1 showed antiproliferative effects
in various tumor cell lines, and in vivo activity was demonstrat-
ed in mice bearing xenograft models of NMC. Further studies
describe the efficacy of (+)-1 in mouse models of metabolic
disease[184] and of acute myeloid leukemia.[185] A potential appli-
cation for male contraception was also discussed.[169a] Very re-
cently, Shimamura et al. provided experimental evidence that
(+)-JQ1 ((+)-1) exerts antitumor efficacy in a subset of non-
small-cell lung cancer cells harboring the KRAS mutation.[186]

scored the importance of the 3-methyl substituent of the tria-

BRD4(BD1). Aminoisoxazole 30 made similar hydrogen bond-
ing contacts within the KAc binding pocket, as already de-
scribed for the methyl-1,2,4-triazole moiety of (+)-1 and 2. A
similar 3,5-dimethylisoxazole motif was reported earlier as
a KAc mimic, and is discussed in greater detail in the following
section.[51a, 175c,e] Replacement of the methyltriazole in (+)-1
with the newly identified methylisoxazole led to compounds
with biochemical and cellular activities similar to that of (+)-1

rected into a lipophilic pocket called the ZA channel, which is
not occupied by the native histone peptide. The 4-chlorophen-
yl group of (+)-1 or 2 interacts with another hydrophobic
region called the WPF shelf. All members of the BET family
share this conserved motif, and it is believed that occupying
this region is critical for good binding affinities as well as for
gaining selectivity over non-BET bromodomains.[48b]

3.1.3. Identification of structural motifs acting as
acetyllysine (KAc) mimics

Since the discovery of triazolodiazepines (+)-1 and 2, much
effort has been invested in identifying new chemotypes as se-
lective BET bromodomain inhibitors. One frequently applied
strategy was the identification of an alternative acetyllysine-
mimicking moiety binding to the conserved KAc binding
pocket of the bromodomain by a fragment-based drug discov-
ery approach and a subsequent structure-based optimization
program. In this way, several fragments were identified as ace-
tyllysine mimics, shown in Figure 10.[187]

Similar to the known 3-methyl-1,2,4-triazole (Figure 10 a), the
3,5-dimethylisoxazole[51a, 175c,e] (Figure 10 b), the 3-methyl-3,4-di-
hydroquinazolinone[176a, 177a] (Figure 10 c), the N-acetyl-2-methyl-
tetrahydroquinoline[176] (Figure 10 d), and the 2-thiazolidinone
(Figure 10 e) moieties share the same essential
features re-
quired for binding to the KAc binding pocket: a hydrogen-
bonding functionality to interact with the conserved aspara-
gine and tyrosine (water-mediated) residues and a small alkyl
substituent binding to a small hydrophobic pocket that is re-
sponsible for recognition of the KAc acetyl methyl group
(except for the 2-thiazolidinone fragment, Figure 10 e). In the
case of the 3-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolinone moiety (Fig-
ure 10 c) an additional hydrogen bond interaction is formed
between the urea NH proton and the carbonyl function of the
asparagine amide.
In the following section, the fragment-
based discovery of several KAc mimics and their optimization
to improve potency and pharmacokinetic properties is re-
viewed. At this point, most work has been done on com-
pounds bearing a 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety.

3.1.4. 3,5-Dimethylisoxazoles

The 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety has been independently
identified as KAc mimic by Bamborough et al.,[175e] Hewings
et al.,[175c] and Dawson et al.[51a] Hewings et al. found 3,5-dime-
thylisoxazoles as a KAc bioisostere from an X-ray crystal struc-
ture of compound 63 (Figure 11) bound to BRD4(BD1).[175c]

www.chemmedchem.org

Figure 11. Starting point 63 and optimized 3,5-dimethylisoxazolo com-
pounds 64 and 8 reported by Hewings et al. as BET bromodomain inhibi-
tors.[175c,d]

They identified the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety as a KAc
mimic with the isoxazole oxygen atom forming a hydrogen
bond with the amide NH2 of asparagine residue N140 and the
isoxazole nitrogen atom forming a water-mediated hydrogen
bond with tyrosine residue Y97 (Figure 10 a). The ethylene
glycol substituent of 63 was observed to be directed into the
hydrophobic WPF shelf, which is occupied by a 4-chlorophenyl
substituent in the case of (+)-1 and 2 (see Figure 5). With the
help of molecular modeling calculations, a di-meta-substituted
3,5-dimethyl-4-phenylisoxazole scaffold was designed. Com-
pound 64 showed activity in the low-micromolar range (IC50 =
4.8 mm, BRD4(BD1) AlphaScreen) as well as selectivity for BET
bromodomains (determined by ITC). A crystal structure of 64
bound to BRD4(BD1) was solved and confirmed the binding
mode of the dimethylisoxazole as a KAc mimic to be identical
to that of 63 (Figure 12).

However, in a successive study the ethoxy substituent (di-
rected into the ZA channel; Figure 12) and the methyl sub-
stituent of 64 (directed into the hydrophobic WPF shelf;
Figure 12) were chosen for SAR investigations to enhance the
ligand–protein interactions.[175d] Compound 8 was identified as
having higher binding affinities for BRD4(BD1) (IC50 = 382 nm
for (S)-8 and 386 nm for (R)-8, AlphaScreen assay) than that of
64 and anti-proliferative effects in an acute myeloid leukemia
line (sub-micromolar IC50 values). Compound 8 showed
cell
moderate selectivity over the CREBBP bromodomain and excel-
lent selectivity over other phylogenetically diverse bromodo-
main classes. The crystal structure of (S)-8 bound to human
BRD4(BD1) revealed that the phenyl ring occupies the WPF
shelf more effectively than the smaller methyl substituent of
64, and that the phenol hydroxy group forms an additional hy-
drogen bond to a conserved water molecule located in the ZA
channel. The combination of these two interactions pushes the

Bamborough et al. identified 3,5-dimethyl-4-phenylisoxazole
(structure not shown) from a rationally selected screening set
as a KAc mimic by a fluorescence anisotropy assay and con-
firmed the binding mode to be exactly the same as reported
by Hewings et al.[175e]

Compounds with a sulfonamide substituent on the phenyl
ring meta to the isoxazole were chosen from a 3D pharmaco-
phore model as a strategy to improve binding affinity. This led
to compounds 65–66 (Figure 13) with IC50 values in the low-

main inhibitors by Bamborough et al.[175e]

micromolar range (fluorescence and FRET assays). As apparent
from the X-ray crystal structures, the sulfonamide in the meta
position introduces a bend in the shape of the molecule and
directs the cycloalkyl residues into the hydrophobic WPF shelf
(similarly to compounds 64 and 8 reported by Hewings
et al.[175c,d]). The sulfonamide itself is involved in a water-medi-
ated hydrogen bonding network. To improve the solubility of
the compound series, polar and solubilizing groups were at-
tached to the phenyl para position, as this position points
toward the solvent, and variations have little effect on potency.
Compound 10 retained the affinity of the simpler analogues

Referring to the findings of Hewings et al.,[175c] Bamborough

tuted benzimidazoles have recently been identified as potent

tion, benzimidazoles 11 and 68–69 (Figure 14) were identified
as preferred core structures with benzyl substituents being su-
perior in their biological activity to phenyl substituents at the
benzimidazole 1-position.

Compound 11 showed an IC50 value of 180 nm and a 100-
fold selectivity over the CREBBP bromodomain (confirmed by
an AlphaScreen assay). As noted by the authors, the easy
three-step synthesis of the scaffold shown in Scheme 5 makes
it an attractive template for bromodomain lead discovery proj-
ects.[175f] Nucleophilic substitution of 2,4-dibromonitrobenzene
70 with 4-chlorobenzylamine was followed by reduction of the
nitro group under standard conditions and cyclization to the
benzimidazole core with formic acid. A final Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling of aryl bromide 71 with 3,5-dimethylisoxazolyl-
boronic acid afforded the final compound 68.

Researchers from GlaxoSmithKline were the third to describe
the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety as a KAc mimic.[37, 51a, 175a] Simi-
lar to the discovery of I-BET762 (2), the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole-
substituted quinoline 72 (Figure 15) was identified as a robust
hit from a phenotypic HTS campaign in the search for up-regu-

lators of ApoA1 (EC170 = 500 nm compared with EC170 = 200 nm
for 2).

SAR studies revealed that the carboxamide at the 3-position
is ideal for potency on ApoA1 up-regulation and that a variety
of aromatic, benzylic, or aliphatic substituents at the 4-position
are well tolerated. To freeze the likely active conformation of
72, resulting from a postulated intramolecular hydrogen bond
between the C3 carboxamide and the C4 NH group, and to
eliminate the free carboxamide moiety, cyclized analogues
with an imidazolone ring were synthesized. The careful choice
of the amine substituent and the incorporation of a methoxy
group on the quinoline 6-position resulted in the discovery of
compound 7 (I-BET151), which displayed high potency on
ApoA1 up-regulation (EC170 = 90 nm) and abolished the cyto-
chrome P450 liabilities observed in both quinoline series (with
or without imidazolone). Compound 7 showed activities similar
to that of 2 in biochemical and cellular assays, but an im-
proved in vivo pharmacokinetic profile relative to (+)-1 or 2.
Its efficacy for the treatment of inflammation was demonstrat-
ed in a murine model of endotoxic shock in prophylactic and
therapeutic dosing regimens. In addition, 7 was shown to be
effective in two distinct mouse models of murine and human
leukemia. The X-ray crystal structure of 7 bound to human
BRD4(BD1) was solved and showed the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole
bound to the KAc binding pocket to form similar interactions

that the introduction of an addi-

atom adjacent to the inter-ring

acetyl head group. The pyridyl group bound to the WPF shelf
and the quinoline nitrogen atom accepted a hydrogen bond
from a water molecule conserved in the ZA channel (similar to
the phenolic hydroxy group of 8). A representative synthesis of
7 is shown in Scheme 6.[51a]

In the first step, the isoxazole was introduced via a Suzuki–
Miyaura cross-coupling of aryl iodide 74 with 3,5-dimethylisox-
azole boronic acid. The nitro group was reduced to an aniline
intermediate, which was transformed into quinolinone 77 by
condensation of the aniline amino group with diethyl 2-(ethox-
ymethylene)malonate and subsequent thermal cyclization of
the resultant enamine 76. Saponification of the ethyl ester was
followed by a POCl3-mediated chlorination to give the aryl
chloride as well as the appropriate acid chloride of the carbox-
ylic acid function, which was converted into carboxamide 78
by treatment with ammonia. Nucleophilic substitution of the
aryl chlorine atom with the appropriate amine led to 79, which
was transformed into the desired compound 7 by a Hofmann
rearrangement of the carboxamide functionality and an intra-
molecular attack of the adjacent secondary amine to the inter-
mediate isocyanate.

Recently, compound 73 (Figure 15) was reported in a patent
application from GlaxoSmithKline.[189] Relative to 7, the imida-
zolone and the pyridine-2-ylmethyl substituents were replaced
by a substituted imidazole group and a 1-methoxypropan-2-yl
residue, respectively. The activity of compound 73 was con-
firmed in different cell-based assays in which anti-inflammatory
and anti-proliferation effects were measured as well as in an in
vivo efficacy mouse model of acute inflammation.

Referring to their previous findings on compound 7, Mirguet

dine core analogues of 7 as novel BET family bromodomain in-

induce a kink in the 6-substituent directing a side chain into
the hydrophobic WPF shelf (similar to the findings of Bambor-
ough et al.[175e]). Sulfonamide 13 was identified as one of the
most potent ligands, with an IC50 value of 220 nm for BRD4 (Al-
phaScreen) and high selectivity for the BET bromodomains, as
confirmed by a temperature shift assay. The X-ray crystal struc-
ture of 13 bound to BRD4(BD1) showed the key interactions of
the urea carbonyl with N140 and Y97 (water-mediated) as well
as an additional hydrogen bond between the urea NH proton
and the amide carbonyl oxygen of the asparagine residue
N140 in the KAc binding pocket (see Figure 10 c).[56] The ortho-
methoxy-substituted phenyl ring was directed into the hydro-
phobic WPF shelf, and the sulfonamide NH function was fur-
ther shown to be involved in a water-mediated hydrogen
bond to a backbone carbonyl group of the ZA loop. The cellu-
lar activity of 13 was confirmed in an IL-6 assay as well as the
lines.[56, 177] Moreover,
antiproliferative effects on leukemia cell
13 showed an acceptable in vivo pharmacokinetic profile for
oral administration.[56, 177]

3.1.6. N-acetyl-2-methyltetrahydroquinolines

structural knowledge of BET bromodomains

Chung et al. discovered the N-acetyl-2-methyltetrahydroquino-
line (THQ) fragment 82 by screening a focused fragment set of
putative KAc mimics which was assembled using the X-ray
crystal
(Fig-
ure 17).[176a] The binding mode of fragment 82 was confirmed
by its X-ray crystal structure in complex with BRD2(BD1) and
showed the THQ N-acetyl group of 82 to mimic the acetylly-
sine side chain of the natural ligand and to form interactions
with N156 and the bridging water molecule described earlier
(see Figure 10 d). Its methyl group bound in the same pocket

as the KAc methyl group. The S configuration of the THQ C2
atom placed the methyl group into another small
lipophilic
pocket, which is not occupied by the acetyllysine side chain.
Compounds based on the THQ moiety were reported in
patent applications from GlaxoSmithKline, and a representative
selection is shown in Figure 17.[176b, 190] The majority of these
compounds share the common N-acetyl-2-methyltetrahydro-
quinoline core, although some exceptions are reported with
an N-propanoyl residue or an ethyl substituent at the 2-posi-
tion. In the 4-position of the THQ core an amino group derivat-
ized as a carbamate (isopropyl carbamate in particular), aniline,
or an amino heterocycle is present in most of the exemplified
compounds. On the (hetero)aryl ring attached at the THQ 6-
position numerous heteroaromatic, basic, neutral, and acidic
functionalities were reported. A number of the claimed com-
pounds were found to be potent in a fluorescence anisotropy
binding assay as well as in whole-blood assays measuring
levels of inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNFa and IL-6).[176b] The
efficacy of compound 12 was further confirmed in an in vivo
mouse endotoxemia model, and its activity as a cell growth in-
hibitor in several tumor cell lines was demonstrated.[176b] Wyce
et al. very recently identified I-BET726 (12) as an effective com-
pound for the treatment of neuroblastoma tumors in vivo in
mouse xenograft models after oral administration.[191] They also
confirmed the binding mode of compound 12 in complex with
BRD4(BD1) by X-ray crystal structure determination with the
THQ N-acetyl group binding to the KAc binding pocket. The
selectivity of I-BET726 (12) for the BET family of bromodomains
was demonstrated by a fluorescent thermal shift assay.[191]

The synthesis of representative compound 12 is shown in
Scheme 7. An enantioselective aza-Michael addition of aniline
86 with a,b-unsaturated carbamate 87 in the presence of
a chiral PdII catalyst gave carbamate 88 in good yield and high
enantiomeric purity. The tetrahydroquinoline core was formed
by Lewis-acid-mediated reduction of the amide carbonyl func-
tion and subsequent cyclization to tetrahydroquinoline 89. The
C2 stereochemistry directed the cyclization to give a single dia-
stereomer of 89. Acetylation of the tetrahydroquinoline nitro-
gen atom under
followed by
a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction with (4-ethoxycarbo-
nylphenyl)boronic acid to yield compound 90. The carbamate
moiety was cleaved with aluminum trichloride, and a subse-
quent Buchwald coupling of amine 91 with 1-bromo-4-chloro-
benzene followed by saponification of the ethyl ester gave the
final compound 12.

lized in complex with BRD4(BD1). Similar to the isoxazole
moiety described earlier, the 2-thiazolidinone ring bound to
the KAc binding pocket by a direct hydrogen bond of its car-
bonyl group with the amide NH2 of N140 and a water-mediat-
ed hydrogen bond with Y97. In addition, the nitrogen atom of

3.1.8. Other chemotypes as BET bromodomain
inhibitors

A benzimidazole-based BET bromodomain inhibitor
(BIC1 14, Figure 4) was reported by Ito et al.[178] Com-
pound 14 was identified by surface plasmon reso-
nance measurements, and its KD value was deter-
mined to be 28 mm for BRD2(BD1). Interestingly, the
structure of 14 in complex with
X-ray crystal
BRD2(BD1) revealed that the benzimidazole benzene
ring occupies the KAc binding pocket. In contrast to
the structures described in the previous section, no
hydrogen bonds to the conserved asparagine and ty-
rosine residues of the KAc binding pocket were ob-
served. The benzimidazole-2-thione moiety was di-
rected toward the WPF shelf.

Further examples for BET bromodomain ligands
have been published in the patent literature. Pyrazo-
lopyridazines (16, 98–103) were reported in a patent

the 2-thiazolidinone core formed another water-mediated hy-
drogen bond with the amide CO group of N140 (see Fig-
ure 10 e). Similar to the findings of Bamborough et al.[175e] and
Fish et al.,[177a] a sulfonamide functionality was attached at the
meta position of the phenyl ring to direct a side chain into the
hydrophobic WPF shelf (compounds 15 and 93, Figure 18).
Moreover, the incorporation of an amide side chain at the
second phenyl meta position was found to further improve
binding affinities.

An X-ray crystal structure reveals that the amide functionali-
ty of compound 93 extends into the ZA channel and makes
extensive hydrogen bonding interactions with residues lining
this channel. One of the most potent compounds (15, IC50 =

16 (Scheme 9) started with the formation of hydrazine 105
from 3,6-dichloropyridazine-4-carboxylic acid 104. The cycliza-
tion to pyrazolopyridazine 106 was accomplished by thermal

converted into its methyl ester 107 and subsequent substitu-
tion of the aryl chlorine atom with (1S)-N-methyl-1-phenyle-

In addition to GlaxoSmithKline, Constellation Pharmaceuti-

ratories/Abbvie have filed a patent application on pyrrolopyri-
dinones and pyrrolopyridazinones as potent BET bromodomain
inhibitors.[181]

a cancer cell proliferation assay (MX-1 cell line). A sulfone or
sulfonamide moiety at the 1-position of the phenyl ring at-
tached to the pyrrolopyridinone core was essential for high ac-
tivity, and a polar substituent at the pyrrolopyridinone 3-posi-
tion was not tolerated, as compounds 115 and 116 showed
IC50 values > 1 mm (FRET assay, BRD4(BD1)). The efficacy of
compounds 17 and 109–114 was demonstrated in vivo in dif-
ferent cancer xenograft mouse models as well as the efficacy
of compound 17 in an in vivo rat arthritis model.

In conclusion, tremendous efforts have been invested over
the past three years in the identification of selective small-mol-
ecule inhibitors of the BET family of bromodomains both in
academia and in the pharmaceutical industry. This led to the
discovery of chemically diverse ligands, the majority of which
share a similar binding mode to the highly conserved KAc
binding site of the bromodomain pocket. Critical ligand–pro-
tein interactions responsible for high affinity and selectivity
have been revealed by extensive X-ray crystal structure deter-
minations, thus helping in the optimization of binding proper-
ties. The first BET bromodomain inhibitors have already en-
tered clinical trials, and it will soon be seen whether their ex-
pected therapeutic use can be confirmed.

Zhou and co-workers performed pioneering experi-
ments in the development of small-molecule bromo-
domain ligands. They obtained the first solution
structure of the PCAF bromodomain and showed
that this protein binds specifically to acetylated lysine
50 of the human immunodeficiency virus Tat pro-
tein.[195] The Tat-KAc50–PCAF interaction is important
for viral transcription and could potentially be target-

as inhibiting the interac-
tion of biotinylated Tat-
KAc50 peptide with an
IC50 value of 1.6 mm. De-
spite further efforts to optimize
compound 128, no significant in-
crease in potency was reported.[112]

In comparison with the field of kinase inhibitors, the variety of

higher affinity.[193]

Very recently, Vidler et al. described the discovery of four
new unprecedented KAc mimics (Figure 22).[194] They identified
compounds 124–127 by a structure-based virtual screening
approach and a subsequent improvement of the biological ac-
tivity of the initial screening hits through the use of co-crystal
structures and structure-based design. Compounds 124–127

reader domains as well as for validating functional assays. In

main were identified by Zhou et al. by screening a focused li-
brary of 200 compounds with a special focus on KAc mimics to
interact with the KAc binding pocket. As the entrance to the
CREBBP bromodomain pocket is positively charged, electron-

steps, giving triazolopyridazine 133. After Boc protection of
the free amino function, the aryl chloride functionality of 134

rich functional groups were preferred in compound
collection. The library was screened by using 1H–15N
HSQC spectra measured in the presence and absence
of a mixture of eight
fragments. Fourteen com-
pounds binding to the CREBBP bromodomain were
identified in this screen. The p53 KAc382–CREBBP
bromodomain interaction was blocked by com-
pounds rac-82 (MS 2126) at 100 mm and 139 at
50 mm.[199] Furthermore, the effect of compounds rac-
82 and 139 on p53 translational activation was stud-
ied in human bone osteosarcoma epithelial cells. In
another screen of a library of 3000 compounds using
the 1H–15N HSQC-based assay, the same group identi-
fied the 4-hydroxyphenylazobenzenesulfonic acid
(MS 456).[200] Further optimization resulted in the
more potent compound ischemin 140 (Figure 25),
with a KD value of 19 mm and an IC50 value of 5 mm in
the cell-based p21 luciferase assay. An NMR study
showed that 140 occupies the peptide binding
groove of the CREBBP bromodomain. However, the
compound does not protrude far into the KAc bind-
ing pocket.[96] The selectivity of ischemin 140 for the
bromodomain of CREBBP over other bromodomains
was investigated using a fluorescence assay. Com-

main over PCAF, BRD4(BD1), and BAZ2B.

Conway, Heightman, and co-workers reported several 3,5-di-
methylisoxazole derivatives which bind to the CREBBP bromo-
domain in addition to BET BD1 pockets.[175c] The 3,5-dimethyli-
soxazole acts as a KAc mimic that binds in the KAc binding
pocket in a similar orientation as
the
3,5-dimethylisoxazole-based
BET bromodomain ligands. Com-
pound 141 (Figure 26) has an IC50
value of 32 mm against the CREBBP
bromodomain and shows modest
this bromodomain
selectivity for
over BRD4(BD1). However,
it has
an IC50 value of 28 mm against
BRD2(BD1). Despite this modest
potency, compound 141 might be
considered as a prototype for the
development of more potent and selective 3,5-dimethylisoxa-
zole-based CREBBP bromodomain ligands.

for BAZ2A and BAZ2B bromodo-
mains[204] with an IC50 value in the
BAZ2B AlphaScreen of 9–350 nm.
No interaction of 146 was detect-
ed for
the bromodomains of

thus far.

4. Outlook

Bromodomains are an exciting class of novel targets for thera-
peutic intervention. Highly potent and selective small-molecule
modulators with drug-like properties have been identified re-
cently for several bromodomains. As these compounds bind to
the KAc binding pocket of bromodomains, they act as effective
inhibitors of protein–protein interactions that are usually diffi-
cult to tackle by small molecules. Especially for the BET bromo-
domain family, various chemotypes have been found inde-
pendently by academic and industrial research groups, and the
first BET bromodomain inhibitors have now reached clinical
testing for the treatment of cancer patients. The first selective
and potent chemical probes for other bromodomains have
been published, and these novel tools will be an important
prerequisite for a deeper understanding of the pharmacologi-
cal relevance of non-BET proteins. Although a main focus of

current research is the treatment of cancer patients, there
might be additional opportunities for selective bromodomain
inhibitors in more indications, in light of the implication of bro-
modomain proteins in several other pathologies. Success of
such approaches will depend on whether the therapeutic
window of bromodomain inhibitors will be broad enough for
safe long-term treatment. Given the current high interest and
intensive ongoing efforts in this field, the development of fur-
ther chemical probes and novel drug candidates, for non-BET
bromodomains as well, can be expected in the near future.
This will enable deeper insight into the biology of this fascinat-
ing class of proteins and has the potential to offer new treat-
ment options for patients in various diseases.
