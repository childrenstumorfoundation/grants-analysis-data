Background
Dysregulated hedgehog signaling is the pivotal molecular abnormality underlying 
basal-cell carcinomas. Vismodegib is a new orally administered hedgehog-pathway 
inhibitor that produces objective responses in locally advanced and metastatic basal-
cell carcinomas.

Methods
We tested the anti–basal-cell carcinoma efficacy of vismodegib in a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with the basal-cell nevus syndrome 
at three clinical centers from September 2009 through January 2011. The primary end 
point was reduction in the incidence of new basal-cell carcinomas that were eligible 
for surgical resection (surgically eligible) with vismodegib versus placebo after  
3 months; secondary end points included reduction in the size of existing basal-cell 
carcinomas.

Results
In 41 patients followed for a mean of 8 months (range, 1 to 15) after enrollment, 
the per-patient rate of new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas was lower with 
vismodegib than with placebo (2 vs. 29 cases per group per year, P<0.001), as was 
the size (percent change from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter) of exist-
ing clinically significant basal-cell carcinomas (−65% vs. −11%, P = 0.003). In some 
patients, all basal-cell carcinomas clinically regressed. No tumors progressed during 
treatment with vismodegib. Patients receiving vismodegib routinely had grade 1 or 
2 adverse events of loss of taste, muscle cramps, hair loss, and weight loss. Overall, 
54% of patients (14 of 26) receiving vismodegib discontinued drug treatment owing 
to adverse events. At 1 month, vismodegib use had reduced the hedgehog target-
gene expression by basal-cell carcinoma by 90% (P<0.001) and diminished tumor-
cell proliferation, but apoptosis was not affected. No residual basal-cell carcinoma was 
detectable in 83% of biopsy samples taken from sites of clinically regressed basal-
cell carcinomas.

Conclusions
Vismodegib reduces the basal-cell carcinoma tumor burden and blocks growth of new 
basal-cell carcinomas in patients with the basal-cell nevus syndrome. The adverse 
events associated with treatment led to discontinuation in over half of treated pa-
tients. (Funded by Genentech and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00957229.)

Basal-cell carcinomas are the most 

common cancer in the United States, with 
an  estimated  annual  incidence  of  0.1  to 
0.5%.1 The rare, heritable basal-cell nevus (Gorlin) 
syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 
number, 109400) may cause hundreds to thousands 
of basal-cell carcinomas in a single patient, and 
affected persons are at increased risk for medul-
loblastomas and rhabdomyosarcomas.2 Patients 
with the basal-cell nevus syndrome inherit one de-
fective copy of the tumor-suppressor gene encod-
ing patched 1 (PTCH1), which acts as a primary 
inhibitor of the hedgehog signaling pathway.3-5 
PTCH1 mutations and loss of the remaining wild-
type allele also occur in sporadic basal-cell car-
cinomas6-8;  essentially  all  basal-cell  carcinomas, 
whether or not they are associated with identifi-
able mutations of PTCH1 or the smoothened gene 
(SMO), the target of PTCH1 inhibition, have en-
hanced hedgehog signaling. Currently, no phar-
macologic therapy is consistently efficacious for 
basal-cell carcinomas, and the quality of life for 
patients  with  the  basal-cell  nevus  syndrome  is 
severely diminished by the need for frequent, re-
petitive, scarring surgical procedures.

Vismodegib (Erivedge, Genentech–Curis) is a 
low-molecular-weight  systemic  inhibitor  of  the 
hedgehog signaling pathway that was approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration in January 
2012  for  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic basal-cell carcinomas.9 The efficacy of 
the drug against basal-cell carcinoma, along with 
its low incidence of serious adverse effects, sug-
gested that vismodegib might be suitable for pa-
tients with the basal-cell nevus syndrome, whose 
large numbers of basal-cell carcinomas represent 
a substantial physical and psychological burden. 
Hence, we tested the anti–basal-cell carcinoma ef-
ficacy and safety of vismodegib in patients with 
the basal-cell nevus syndrome. Here, we report the 
results from the planned interim analysis of our 
phase 2 trial.

Methods

Study Conduct
This study was designed by the authors and was 
overseen by an independent data and safety mon-
itoring board that met semiannually to conduct 
three planned interim analyses. The study inves-
tigators designed the protocol, enrolled and ex-
amined the patients, managed and analyzed all 

the  clinical  data,  and  wrote  the  manuscript.  
Genentech supplied the medication, performed 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic measure-
ments,  and  read  drafts  of  the  manuscript  for 
clarity. No one who is not an author contributed 
to the writing of the manuscript.

Study Design
We enrolled 42 patients with the basal-cell nevus 
syndrome at three clinical centers from September 
2009 through January 2011. After providing writ-
ten  informed  consent,  patients  were  randomly 
assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive oral vismode- 
gib (2-chloro-N-[4-chloro-3-(2-pyridinyl)phenyl]-4-
[methylsulfonyl]benzamide) at a dose of 150 mg 
daily or placebo for a planned 18 months. The pri-
mary statistical end point was the comparative rate 
of appearance of new basal-cell carcinomas that 
were eligible for surgical resection (surgically eli-
gible) — those with a diameter of 3 mm or greater 
on the nose or periorbital skin, 5 mm or greater 
elsewhere on the face, or 9 mm or greater on the 
trunk or limbs (excluding the leg below the knees, 
which was not monitored). Secondary end points 
included a reduction in the rate of appearance of 
smaller basal-cell carcinomas (5 mm or less) on 
the upper back with vismodegib versus placebo, 
reduction in size of existing surgically eligible bas-
al-cell carcinomas, duration of the effect  against 
basal-cell  carcinoma  after  drug  discontinuation, 
change in hedgehog target-gene expression in bas-
al-cell carcinomas, and between-group differences 
in adverse events. The complete protocol is avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.

Study Patients and Treatment
All patients had received a clinical diagnosis of the 
basal-cell nevus syndrome on the basis of at least 
two major criteria,10 and all had a total of at least 
10 surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas pres-
ent at study entry or removed during the previous 
2 years. Patients were randomly assigned accord-
ing to a computer-generated randomization list and 
were not stratified on the basis on the prior rate 
of development of basal-cell carcinomas.

Each  patient  received  the  study  drug  for  a 
maximum of 18 months until the occurrence of 
intolerable toxic effects or clinical worsening of 
disease  (defined  as  >60  new  surgically  eligible 
basal-cell carcinomas or doubling of the cumu-
lative longest diameter of existing or new surgi-
cally eligible basal-cell carcinomas).

Assessments
Per protocol, we assessed tumor response by exam-
ining the skin at study visits, monthly for the first 
3 months, every other month for the next 6 months, 
and every 3 months for the final 9 months of the 
18-month study period. We identified basal-cell 
carcinoma lesions clinically, used calipers to mea-
sure their longest diameter, and used clinical pho-
tos from previous visits to ensure consistency of 
clinical examination. The principal investigator 
trained all study dermatologists and participated in 
early study visits to ensure consistent assessments 
of  surgically  eligible  basal-cell  carcinomas.  We 
discontinued the participation of one patient be-
cause of clinical worsening of disease (Fig. 1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM 
.org). We characterized adverse events according 
to the National Cancer Institute Common Termi-
nology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).

In Vitro Studies
We  assessed  the  drug-induced  inhibition  of 
hedgehog  signaling  by  means  of  quantitative 
polymerase-chain-reaction analysis of the levels 
of messenger RNA encoding the hedgehog target 
gene glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (zinc 
finger protein) (GLI1) in skin-shave–biopsy sam-
ples of basal-cell carcinomas taken at baseline and 
1  month  after  the  start  of  vismodegib  treat-
ment, calculated by the 2–ΔCt method, in which 
the cycling threshold (Ct) of GLI1 was normalized 
to the Ct of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-
genase (GAPDH) and expressed as a power of 2 
(2Ct[GLI1]−Ct[GAPDH])  (see  the  Supplementary  Ap-
pendix).

Statistical Analysis
All the analyses presented were prespecified be-
fore the data were unblinded and included data 
from all patients who were randomly assigned to 
a study group (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). We estimated that with 20 patients receiving 
vismodegib and 10 receiving placebo, the study 
would have 80% power to detect a difference of 
50 percentage points between the two groups in 
the primary end point at an overall alpha level of 
0.05 (two-tailed). We anticipated a 20% dropout 
rate and planned to enroll a total of 41 patients. 
We used the generalized linear model11 to ana-
lyze the rate of new surgically eligible basal-cell 
carcinomas. Because the number of new surgically 
eligible basal-cell carcinomas is a count (i.e., non-

continuous) variable, we used the Poisson distri-
bution  and  applied  the  natural  log  link.  The 
natural log of the amount of follow-up time for 
any patient was included as an offset to account for 
differential follow-up among study patients. The 
clinical site and the number of surgically eligible 
basal-cell carcinomas at baseline were included as 
covariates to account for variability among study 
patients. Three interim analyses assessing efficacy 
and adverse events were planned for unblinded data 
managed by an in-house biostatistician supervised 
by the data safety and monitoring board, which 
consisted of three dermatologic clinician–scientists 
and a biostatistician not otherwise involved in 
the  trial  and  unrelated  to  the  study  centers.  We 
used the  Lan–DeMets  alpha-spending  approach 
with the Pocock boundaries to determine the al-
pha level to be applied at each of the three inter-
im analyses and the final analysis to ensure that 
the overall type I error rate was maintained at an 
alpha level of 0.05. We report here the results of 
the second interim analysis, in December 2010, 
when the data safety and monitoring board con-
cluded  that  the  predetermined  threshold  for  a 
significant difference (P<0.0113) between the two 
groups had been reached.

R esults

Study Patients
From September 2009 through January 2011, we 
enrolled 42 patients with the basal-cell nevus syn-
drome. One patient withdrew from the study be-
fore receiving any study medication. Patients ran-
domly assigned to receive placebo or vismodegib 
were similar with regard to age, weight, and base-
line number of surgically eligible basal-cell carci-
nomas (Table 1). At the planned second interim 
analysis in December 2010, the data safety and 
monitoring board recommended ending the pla-
cebo treatment owing to statistically significant 
differences in efficacy favoring the vismodegib 
group. The data cutoff date was February 17, 2011, 
when the institutional review board of the Chil-
dren’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute ap-
proved the recommendation. On this date, all 
41 patients who received a dose of the study drug 
had undergone at least one follow-up visit for tu-
mor and safety assessment, 38 patients had com-
pleted at least 3 months of follow-up visits, and 
patients had been followed for a mean of 8 months 
(range, 1 to 15).

Clinical Response
During the study period, we tracked more than 
2000  existing,  and  694  new,  surgically  eligible 
basal-cell carcinomas. A total of 38 of the 41 pa-
tients (93%) completed at least 3 months of follow-
up visits and had data for the primary end point 
(reduction in the rate of new surgically eligible 
basal-cell carcinomas) at 3 months after receiving 
study medication. We chose this end point expect-
ing that at least 2 months of therapy would be 
required to discern an antitumor effect; however, 
we found a reduction in the numbers of new sur-
gically eligible basal-cell carcinomas with vismo-
degib versus placebo at 1 month (Fig. 1A and 1B). 
Vismodegib significantly reduced the per-patient 
rate of new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas 
below that of the placebo group (mean, 2 vs. 29 
new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas per 
year; median, 2 vs. 25 new surgically eligible basal-
cell carcinomas per year; P<0.001). Vismodegib also 
reduced  the  size  of  existing  surgically  eligible 
basal-cell carcinomas, expressed as the percent 
change from baseline in the sum of the longest 
diameters (mean, −65%, vs. −11% with placebo; 
median, −71%, vs. −21% with placebo; P = 0.003) 
(Fig. 2).

During the trial, patients were allowed to have 
tumors  surgically  removed  at  the  discretion  of 
their  primary  dermatologist.  Patients  receiving 
vismodegib had fewer surgeries as part of stan-
dard  care  as  compared  with  patients  receiving 
placebo (mean number of surgeries per patient, 
0.31, vs. 4.4 with placebo; median, 0, vs. 1.0 for 
placebo; P<0.001). All tumors responded to vis-
modegib treatment, with nearly complete clinical 
remission in some patients. Palmar and plantar 
pits, which are pathognomonic signs of the basal-
cell  nevus  syndrome,  also  disappeared  during 
vismodegib therapy, often within the first month 
(Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Pharmacokinetic  assessment  of  vismodegib 
was performed on plasma samples collected at 
1  month. The median (±SE) total plasma drug 
level was 25±7 μmol per liter (range, 13 to 42). 
We found no correlation between these levels and 
tumor response at 1 or 3 months.

Adverse Events
As of the data cutoff date of February 17, 2011, 
27% of patients receiving vismodegib (7 of 26) had 
stopped the drug, owing to adverse events, dur-
ing a mean observation time of 8 months (Fig. 1

in the Supplementary Appendix). We ended the 
participation of 1 patient in the placebo group 
because of disease progression. Most adverse events 
were mild or moderate in severity, and no grade 
5 events were observed. Patients receiving vismo-
degib were significantly more likely to have grade 
1 or 2 dysgeusia, muscle cramps, hair loss, and 
weight loss, as compared with those receiving pla-
cebo (Fig. 3, and Table 1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). As of January 31, 2012, 54% of patients 
receiving vismodegib (14 of 26) had discontinued 
the medication owing to side effects, and only 1 of 
5 eligible patients was able to continue vismodegib 
for 18 months. Patients receiving vismodegib had 
more grade 3 or 4 adverse events as compared 
with patients receiving placebo (Table 1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). When vismodegib was 
withdrawn, dysgeusia and muscle cramps ceased 
within 1 month, and scalp and body hair started 
to regrow within 3 months.

Histologic and Molecular Studies
We obtained biopsy specimens from basal-cell car-
cinoma tumors to determine the histologic cor-
relates of visible changes in the tumors. Residual 
microscopic basal-cell carcinomas were present 
in  88%  of  random  specimens  (22  of  25)  from 
basal-cell carcinomas that were clinically raised 
(plaques or papules) in patients treated with vis-
modegib for 1 month. Among patients receiving 
vismodegib for more than 3 months, 46% of bi-
opsy specimens (6 of 13) revealed residual tumors 
detected in random histologic sections. Among 
lesions that appeared to be clinically resolved (i.e., 
flat and scarlike without erythema), residual tu-
mors were present in only 17% of biopsy samples

Figure 1. Surgically Eligible Basal-Cell Carcinomas (SEBs) in 36 Patients Followed for More Than 2 Months, 
According to Study Group.
Data are shown for each of the 25 patients receiving vismodegib and 11 patients receiving placebo; individual 
curves cannot always be distinguished. Panels A and B show the cumulative number of new SEBs during the study 
period; Panels C and D show the percent change from baseline in the sums of the longest diameters of SEBs.

(1 of 6) of basal-cell carcinomas (Fig. 4A and 4B). 
The effect of vismodegib against basal-cell carci-
noma was associated with a decrease in hedgehog 
signaling, as shown by a 90% decrease (P<0.001) 
in  GLI1  messenger  RNA  in  biopsy  specimens 
from basal-cell carcinomas in patients treated for 
1 month (Fig. 4C). One month of vismodegib treat-
ment also significantly reduced tumor prolifera-
tion, as assessed by Ki67 expression, but caused no 
change in apoptosis, as assessed by cleaved cas-
pase 3 (Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Observations after Unblinding
Figure 4D illustrates the percent change in cu-
mulative diameter of existing surgically eligible 
basal-cell carcinomas during and after vismodegib 
therapy  in  the  first  four  patients  who  stopped 
vismodegib and were monitored for more than 
3 months after stopping. The sums of the longest 

diameters  returned  to  baseline  levels  several 
months after vismodegib was stopped (Fig. 4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix), as did the palmar 
and plantar pits. Basal-cell carcinomas and pits 
appear to recur at the original sites, and very few 
new surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas de-
veloped after the medication was stopped. In a 
post hoc analysis of seven patients who stopped 
vismodegib, 0.69 new surgically eligible basal-cell 
carcinomas developed per month, a rate that is 
considerably  less  than  that  among  patients  re-
ceiving placebo (2.4 per month).

Discussion

Vismodegib significantly reduced the rate of ap-
pearance of new surgically eligible basal-cell car-
cinomas among patients with the basal-cell nevus 
syndrome. Vismodegib also reduced the initially

substantial burden of surgically eligible basal-cell 
carcinomas, even to the point of clinical resolu-
tion; however, most surgically eligible basal-cell 
carcinomas regrew once the drug was stopped. In 
addition, the drug was associated with adverse 
events; as of January 31, 2012, 54% of patients had 
discontinued vismodegib owing to side effects. 
The adverse events were similar to those reported 
in phase 1 trials9 and phase 2 trials12 of vismodegib 
and other hedgehog inhibitors (LDE225),13 sug-
gesting that the events are due to class-specific 
inhibition of the hedgehog signaling pathway. In 
contrast to vismodegib, the use of topical LDE225 
did not cause taste loss and muscle cramps after 
4 weeks of treatment.14

Our results illustrate the potential for using 
molecularly targeted drugs for cancer chemopre-
vention. The high rate of discontinuing the drug 
because of adverse effects is unlikely to be ame-
liorated by altering the chemical structure, as the 
toxic effects appear to be related to inhibition of 

the drug target, not off-target effects. It is un-
certain whether vismodegib is as effective in the 
10% of basal-cell carcinomas driven by activating 
SMO mutations.15-18 Thus, our results for vismo-
degib use are consistent with the concept of can-
cer  “interception”  —  the  blocking  of  further 
growth of tumors at a stage before they become 
clinically apparent.19

The lack of any demonstrable tumor progres-
sion or resistance to vismodegib during treatment 
contrasts with the development of resistance in 
other hedgehog-driven tumors like medulloblas-
tomas17 and with the frequent development of re-
sistance to therapies targeted to other dysregulated 
oncologic pathways (e.g., epidermal growth factor 
receptor and the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL).20,21 
Perhaps the lack of development of resistance in 
basal-cell  carcinomas  during  treatment  in  this 
study and the rarity of metastatic behavior  cor-
relate with the relative genomic stability of these 
cancers.22  In  contrast,  essentially  all  surgically

Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Freedom from the Most Common Grade 1 or 2 Adverse Events and Study-Drug 
Use, According to Study Group.
Panels A, B, C, and D show freedom from each of the four most common adverse events in the study: hair loss, 
weight loss of more than 5%, muscle cramps, and taste disturbance (dysgeusia), respectively. Panel E shows the 
continued receipt of the assigned study drug (with stopping due to adverse events).

eligible basal-cell carcinomas recur after vismo-
degib treatment is stopped, suggesting the pos-
sibility of drug-tolerant tumor cells with “cancer 
stem  cell”  characteristics  in  basal-cell  carcino-
mas. More broadly, any finding that tumor stem 
cells are resistant to hedgehog inhibition contra-

dicts the concept that cancer stem cells might de-
pend at least partially on hedgehog activation.23,24 
However, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
all  clinically  regressed  tumors  harbor  residual 
groups of tumor cells and that these account for 
the  regrowth  of  tumors  after  stopping  vismo-

Figure 4. Results from Histologic and Molecular Studies.
Panel A shows clinical resolution of a typical basal-cell carcinoma lesion between baseline and 6 months. Panel B 
(hematoxylin and eosin) shows a biopsy specimen from a basal-cell carcinoma lesion at 6 months, with no obvious 
groups of tumor cells visible microscopically in random histologic sections after review by a dermatopathologist. 
(Scar and inflammatory cells are visible near the epidermis.) Panel C shows the messenger-RNA (mRNA) expression 
of the hedgehog target gene glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (zinc finger protein) (GLI1) in basal-cell carci-
nomas at baseline and at 1 month, according to study group. Data for individual patients are shown; the horizontal 
line indicates the mean, and the I bar indicates the standard error. Panel D shows the percent change from baseline 
in the sum of the longest diameters of existing surgically eligible basal-cell carcinomas (SEBs) in each of the first 
four patients (of seven in total) who stopped vismodegib before the 18-month end point and had over 3 months of 
follow-up. Solid segments of each curve indicate months during vismodegib treatment; and dashed segments, 
months after vismodegib was stopped.

degib or the possibility that a small number of 
morphologically normal (histologically unrecog-
nizable) dormant tumor cells remain after exami-
nation of random histologic sections. This phe-
nomenon of regression of basal-cell carcinoma 
after the shutdown of the hedgehog pathway, fol-
lowed by regrowth after hedgehog-pathway reac-
tivation, recapitulates findings in a conditional 
mouse model of basal-cell carcinoma.25

Overall, our findings confirm the essential role 
of the hedgehog pathway in basal-cell carcinomas 
and indicate that vismodegib is efficacious in pre-
venting and treating basal-cell carcinomas in pa-
tients with the basal-cell nevus syndrome.
