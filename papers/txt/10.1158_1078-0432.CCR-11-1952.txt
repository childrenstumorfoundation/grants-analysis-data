Abstract

The evolution of cancer cells involves deregulation of highly regulated fundamental pathways that are
central to normal cellular architecture and functions. p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) was initially identiﬁed
as a downstream effector of the GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Subsequent studies uncovered a variety of new
functions for this kinase in growth factor and steroid receptor signaling, cytoskeleton remodeling, cell
survival, oncogenic transformation, and gene transcription, largely through systematic discovery of its
direct, physiologically relevant substrates. PAK1 is widely upregulated in several human cancers, such as
hormone-dependent cancer, and is intimately linked to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. These
exciting developments combined with the kinase-independent role of PAK1-centered phenotypic signaling
in cancer cells elevated PAK1 as an attractive drug target. Structural and biochemical studies revealed the
precise mechanism of PAK1 activation, offering the possibility to develop PAK1-targeted cancer therapeutic
approaches. In addition, emerging reports suggest the potential of PAK1 and its speciﬁc phosphorylated
substrates as cancer prognostic markers. Here, we summarize recent ﬁndings about the PAK1 molecular
pathways in human cancer and discuss the current status of PAK1-targeted anticancer therapies. Clin Cancer
Res; 18(14); 3743–9. Ó2012 AACR.

Background

Cancer is a complex disease in which many of the
characteristics, such as sustaining proliferation, resisting
cell death, and stimulating invasion and metastasis, are
highly deregulated (1). The signaling pathways behind
these hallmarks of cancer cells involve multiple signaling
kinases. One such family of signaling nodules is com-
posed of p21-activated kinases [PAK (2, 3)]. To date, 6
PAK family members have been identiﬁed in mammalian
cells and classiﬁed into group I (PAK1–3) and group II
(PAK4–6) on the basis of their structural and functional
similarities (2, 3). PAK1, the founding member of the
PAK family, was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Manser and colleagues
(4) in 1994 as a target for the p21ras-related but distinct
proteins Cdc42 and Rac1. Over the years, a large body of
work has connected the PAK family of proteins to diverse
cellular processes, including growth factor and steroid

receptor signaling, cytoskeleton reorganization, onco-
genic transformation, cell survival, and gene transcrip-
tion. These ﬁndings have provided new clues for the
development of PAK1-targeted therapeutic interventions
in human cancer. Here, we summarize recent ﬁndings
regarding the biologic functions of PAK1 signaling in
cancer, and we discuss the progress that has been made
in the development of PAK kinase inhibitors.

PAK1 Functions as a Central Node in Growth
Factor Signaling

Aberrant activation of growth factor receptor signaling is
a common feature in human cancer and is associated with
disease progression, treatment resistance, and poor prog-
nosis. In 1996, 2 groups simultaneously reported that
growth factor–mediated activation of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK) recruits PAK1 to the plasma membrane
through association with the adapter protein Nck and
increases its kinase activity (5, 6). Subsequent studies
showed that PAK1 also feeds into the HER2 pathway and
controls the invasiveness of breast cancer cells via PI-3
kinase–mediated signaling (7). Accumulating evidence fur-
ther suggests a central role for PAK1 in growth factor
signaling networks,
thereby establishing an important
mechanism for PAK1 in growth factor signaling–mediated
tumorigenesis and tumor progression (2, 8). In the same
vein, the Rac–Pak pathway also has been found to be critical
for HER2-mediated transformation of human breast cancer

cells, supporting a model in which PAK1 cooperates with
other oncogenes in transforming epithelial cells (9).

PAK1 Regulates Cytoskeletal Signaling

The cytoskeleton is a complex network of polymeric
ﬁlaments (e.g., actin ﬁlaments, intermediate ﬁbers, and
microtubules) that control the internal organization, shape,
motility, and life cycle of eukaryotic cells (10). Although it is
well established that the GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 regulate
the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, the involve-
ment of PAK1 kinase in regulation of the cytoskeleton was
not reported until 1997. Studies showed that PAK1 regu-
lates the dissolution of stress ﬁbers and reorganization of
focal complexes (11), and the structure of the actin cyto-
skeleton in mammalian cells (12). Later studies further
showed that PAK1 regulates cytoskeleton signaling through
phosphorylation of distinct cytoskeletal substrates, includ-
ing the p41-Arc subunit of human Arp2/3 complex (13), the
actin-binding proteins LIM-kinase [LIMK (14)] and ﬁlamin
A [FLNA (15)], and the microtubule-destabilizing proteins
stathmin [STMN (16)] and tubulin cofactor B [TCoB (17)].
In addition, PAK1 kinase is stimulated by the direct inter-
action of proteins other than Cdc42 and Rac1, such as
deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) and FLNA (15, 18). Of
interest, a kinase-independent mechanism of cytoskeletal
regulation by PAK1 has been also proposed (19, 20), raising
the possibility that PAK1 may elicit signaling through
protein–protein interaction rather than through kinase
activity only (20). These ﬁndings suggest that PAK1 serves
as an effector for Cdc42 and/or Rac1 in promoting cell
motility. Indeed, overexpression of PAK1 has been shown to
enhance cancer cell migration and metastasis in various
tumor model systems (2).

PAK1 Promotes Oncogenic Transformation and
Survival

Oncogenic transformation requires a coordinated regu-
lation of signals from oncogenes to stimulate anchorage-
independent proliferation, rearrange the actin cytoskeleton,
and promote cell survival. Because PAK1 functions as a
central node in a complex network of oncogenic signaling
pathways (2), its overexpression could potentially inﬂuence
oncogenic transformation and survival in multiple ways. In
1997, Tang and colleagues (21) showed that expression of a
catalytically inactive PAK1 kinase inhibited Ras transforma-
tion in Rat-1 ﬁbroblast cells. Of interest, a functional p21-
binding domain (PBD) was not required for Ras inhibition,
indicating that this inhibition was not due to sequestration
of Cdc42 and Rac (21). Further studies showed that the
Akt proto-oncogene is a key intermediate between Ras and
PAK1 (22). In this context, Akt stimulates PAK1 through a
GTPase-independent mechanism, and then PAK1 phos-
phorylates the death agonist Bad and protects cells from
apoptosis (22, 23). Consistently,
inhibition of PAK1
reduces Bad phosphorylation and increases apoptosis
(24). PAK1 also promotes cell survival by phosphorylating
rescuing the
the dynein light chain LC8 on Ser88,

programmed cell death anoikis, and regulating NF-kB–
dependent survival pathways (18, 25). In support of these
ﬁndings, using a transgenic mouse model, Wang and col-
leagues (26) provided the ﬁrst direct evidence that PAK1
deregulation may be sufﬁcient for the formation of mam-
mary gland tumors in vivo. These observations establish
PAK1 as a breast cancer oncogene that coordinately regu-
lates multiple signaling pathways leading to malignant
transformation. Consistent with this notion, therapeutic
agents that suppress PAK1-mediated survival signals were
shown to improve the efﬁcacy of current cancer che-
motherapies by inducing cell death (24).

PAK1 Interjects into Chromatin and Nuclear
Signaling

In addition to the signiﬁcance of PAK1 in cytoskeleton
remodeling and the signaling network, accumulating evi-
dence is highlighting the nuclear functions of PAK1 in
biologic processes that are relevant for endocrine resistance
and gene transcription. Further, the lessons learned from
work on PAK1 have been extended to other family mem-
bers, such as PAK4, in terms of its role in cancer as well as its
nuclear localization and functions (27). The ﬁrst clue to the
nuclear functions of PAK1 in cancer cells came from a study
in 2000, in which Vadlamudi and colleagues (28) showed
that overexpression of PAK1 in breast cancer cells led to
multiple spindle poles and abnormal mitosis, a process
known as aneuploidy in cancer cells. Soon after, PAK1 was
found to be localized in the nucleus of breast tumors (29),
and its localization to the spindle poles was shown to
depend on its kinase activity (30). These results provided
distinct clues about the participation of other molecules,
such as Aurora A (31), TCoB (17), and Arpc1b, a newly
discovered resident of the spindle pole that is directly
phosphorylated on Thr21 by PAK1 or Aurora A (32) in
mitosis. It is now accepted that the nuclear functions of
PAK1 are important not only in cancer cells but also in
normal cells to ensure completion of mitosis (30). Recent
studies showed that interaction with dynein light chain,
LC8, is required for PAK1 nuclear import (33).

PAK1 inﬂuences gene transcription in several ways.
Singh and colleagues (34) showed that PAK1 is directly
associated with chromatin and actively participates in the
process of gene expression. In addition to a direct asso-
ciation with chromatin, PAK1 affects gene transcription
by posttranslational modiﬁcation of transcriptional co-
regulators. In this context, PAK1 phosphorylates tran-
scriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein 1
(CtBP) selectively on Ser158 within a putative regulatory
loop, triggering CtBP cellular redistribution and blocking
CtBP corepressor functions (35). Similarly, PAK1 phos-
phorylates SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein
(SHARP) at Ser3486 and Thr3568 within the SHARP
repression domain, and it regulates SHARP-mediated
repression of Notch target reporter gene activation, there-
by modulating Notch signaling in human cancer cells
(36). In addition, PAK1 phosphorylates Snail on Ser246,

which in turn modulates the process of epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition by affecting the expression of
E-cadherin (37).

PAK1 Hyperaction Promotes Hormone
Independence

PAK1 can directly phosphorylate estrogen receptor a
(ERa) at Ser305 and promote the transactivation activity
of ERa (38), thereby contributing to the development of
hormone-independent growth of breast cancer cells (39).
Moreover, the same Ser305 of ERa was shown to be phos-
phorylated by another signaling molecule, PKA, which was
associated with an expected manifestation of tamoxifen
resistance (40, 41). Furthermore, PAK1 signaling-depen-
dent activation of ER-S305 leads to an enhanced phosphor-
ylation at Ser118, presumably due to an intramolecular
conformational change, and such structural modiﬁcations
may participate in the development of tamoxifen resistance
(42). In agreement with this notion, studies of physiolog-
ically relevant model systems revealed a progressive nuclear
accumulation of PAK1 during breast cancer progression
(26). This led to a ﬁrm correlation between the increase
in nuclear PAK1 and lack of tamoxifen response in a
study of premenopausal patients with breast cancer whose
tumors showed overexpression of PAK1 (43, 44). Thus,
high PAK1 protein levels may indicate tamoxifen insensi-
tivity in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer in the
clinical setting (45, 46), raising the possibility that tamox-
ifen resistance can be reversed by PAK1 inhibition. In
support of this notion, histone deacetylase inhibitor FK22
was shown to signiﬁcantly reduce the kinase activity of
PAK1 and strongly inhibit the estrogen-dependent growth
of human breast cancers (47). Because Ser305 of ERa
is phosphorylated by more than one signaling molecule,
this shifted the focus of the ﬁeld to the site of modiﬁca-
tion rather than the kinases that may be responsible for
phosphorylating ERa on Ser305. It is now generally accept-
ed that Ser305 phosphorylation plays a critical role in
the ligand-independent transactivation of ERa through
multiple signals other than estrogen, contributing to the
development of tamoxifen resistance. Collectively, these
ﬁndings open new avenues to further the search for nuclear
PAK1 functions and identify putative PAK1-interacting
nuclear proteins.

Molecular Mechanism of PAK1 Activation

Given the crucial role of PAK1 in cancer, understanding
the molecular mechanism of PAK1 activation is of para-
mount importance. All PAK isoforms contain a highly
conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal
regulatory domain. The regulatory domain consists of a
PBD, an autoinhibitory domain (AID), 5 SH3 domains,
and 1 nonclassical SH3-binding site for the PIX family
of proteins (Supplementary Fig. S1; refs. 2, 3). Group I
PAKs contain an AID that is highly conserved in organisms
ranging from yeasts to humans but is not present in the
group II PAK proteins (48). The AID domain in the PAK1

kinase binds in the active-site cleft and sequesters the kinase
activation loop in an inactive conformation (49, 50). PAK1
activators relieve this autoinhibition and initiate confor-
mational rearrangements and autophosphorylation events
leading to kinase activation (49). In this context, PAK1 has
7 autophosphorylation sites: Ser21, Ser57, Ser144, Ser149,
Ser198, Ser203, and Thr423. Of these, Ser21 and Ser144
have been reported to contribute toward PAK1 activation,
and Thr423 has proved to be the most critical because it
inhibits the binding of the autoinhibitory region and sta-
bilizes the activation segment of PAK1 upon phosphoryla-
tion (51).

Structural studies have presented snapshots of autoinhi-
bitory, transphosphorylated, and fully active conforma-
tions of the PAK1 kinase domain, providing the initial
models that are needed for PAK1 inhibitor development.
The most recent structural study by Wang and colleagues
(52) revealed that the unphosphorylated ATP analogue-
bound PAK1 kinase domain adopts an asymmetric face-to-
face dimeric conformation, which is different from the
autoinhibited state. In the dimer, one monomer adopts an
inactive conformation as expected, but surprisingly, the
activation loop of the inactive monomer occupies the
substrate-binding region of another monomer, enabling
the active conformation, albeit without Thr423 phosphor-
ylation. Once the substrate interacts with the kinase
domain, it seems to adopt an active conformation (52).
Thus, it is evident that the activation of PAK1 is a dynamic,
versatile process that has immense adaptability and ﬂexi-
bility. Taken together, these studies highlight several stages,
ranging from the inactive to the active state of PAK1, that
could be exploited for inhibitor development.

Clinical–Translational Advances

PAK1 has been shown to be highly upregulated in several
human cancers, including hormone-dependent breast and
ovarian cancers, digestive system cancers, and central ner-
vous system cancers, by increased copy number of the Pak1
gene, hyperactivation of GTPases or other upstream signal-
ing adaptors, or downregulation or inhibition of endoge-
nous negative regulators of PAK1 (Supplementary Table S1;
refs. 2, 8). Of interest, PAK1 is not itself activated by
mutation. Given its functional importance in tumorigenesis
and metastasis (2), investigators are making considerable
efforts to develop highly selective and potent PAK1 inhibi-
tors, which will serve as a basis for further development of
PAK1-based therapeutics in targeting cancer.

Endogenous PAK1 Inhibitors

Given that PAK1 inﬂuences a variety of cellular functions,
the identiﬁcation of factors that control the level of PAK1
protein and activity is of great importance. Recent studies
revealed that the Rho-family GTPases Cdc42 and Chp target
their downstream effector protein PAK1 for proteasomal
degradation (53). The NF2 tumor-suppressor gene product
merlin inhibits the activation of PAK1 through binding to
the PBD of PAK1 (54). Similarly, the serine/threonine

protein kinase LKB1, a tumor-suppressor gene that is impli-
cated in suppression of cell growth and metastasis, sup-
presses PAK1 by phosphorylation of Thr109 in the PBD
(55). By performing a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mammary
gland library, Talukder and colleagues (56) found that
cysteine-rich inhibitor of PAK1 (CRIPAK) is an endogenous
PAK1 inhibitor that has a role in the modulation of PAK1-
mediated ER transactivation in breast
cells.
Nischarin, a binding partner for the a5b1 integrin, selec-
tively inhibits PAK1 kinase activity and PAK1-mediated cell
migration through direct interaction with the C-terminal
domain of PAK1 (57). Similarly, another PAK1 interacting
protein, hPIP1, which is homologous to the ﬁssion yeast
PAK1 regulator Skb15, also blocks PAK1 autoactivation.

microRNAs (miRNA) are noncoding RNAs that inhibit
the expression of their targets in a sequence-speciﬁc manner
and play crucial roles during oncogenesis. It was ﬁrst
reported that miRNA-7 (miR-7) inhibits PAK1 expression
0
by targeting the 3
-untranslated region of PAK1 mRNA and,
consequently, modulates the function of PAK1 in human
cancer cells (58). In agreement with the above ﬁnding, miR-
7 attenuation in schwannoma tumors was shown to stim-
ulate growth partially by upregulating PAK1-mediated
oncogenic signaling pathways (59). Recently, it was also
shown that 2 functional endothelial cell–speciﬁc miRNAs,
miR-126a and miR-126b, repress PAK1 expression to reg-
ulate vascular integrity in zebraﬁsh (60).

PAK1 Small-Molecule Inhibitors

Initial studies by Nheu and colleagues (61) showed that
CEP-1347, a synthetic derivative of the ATP antagonist
K252a, directly inhibits PAK1 activity and selectively blocks
the growth of Ras transformants. Subsequent screening
efforts resulted in the identiﬁcation of a derivative of a
cyclooxygenase inhibitor, OSU-03012, that inhibited PAK1
with an IC50 of 1 mmol/L (62). Another, more recent effort
to screen a small library of 48 ruthenium complexes yielded
a highly speciﬁc tetrahedral organoruthenium-based PAK1
inhibitor. Further optimization of the initial hit compound
from the above screen by Maksimoska and colleagues (63)
revealed a highly selective and potent inhibitor, FL172,
which showed better selectivity in a panel of 264 screened
kinases but little potency against group II PAKs. The cocrys-
tallization of PAK1-FL172 indicated that further optimiza-
tion might yield more selective and potent compounds
(63).

Apart

from the PAK1-targeted inhibitors, a recent
work that employed high-throughput
screening and
structure-based drug design reported the development of
PF-3758309, a potent (dissociation constant ¼ 2.7 nmol/L)
ATP-competitive, pyrrolopyrazole inhibitor of PAK4, a
group II PAK.However, PF-3758309 has been shown to
inhibit both group I and group II PAKs, perhaps due to the
similarities in the kinases’ domains and active sites (8). This
ATP-mimetic compound is orally administrable and shows

potent binding and inhibition of PAKs. When this com-
pound was screened against 92 tumor cell lines, many

of them showed good IC50 values (10 nm). In addition

to small-molecule inhibitor developments,
there has
been a recent report on de novo computational design-
based PAK1 interacting protein, which can bind the PAK1
autoinhibitory domain interaction interface in its active
conformation and inhibit activation by Cdc42 (64).
The newly reengineered proteins bind to active PAK1 with
micromolar afﬁnities, which is a good starting point;
however, further optimizations are needed to make this
approach therapeutically useful.

Allosteric Inhibitors That Target the PAK1
Activation Transition States

Allosteric inhibitors that can interact with non-ATP–bind-
ing sites, such as the interface of the regulatory and catalytic
domain or other regulatory regions, are also being pursued.
0
Such investigations led to the identiﬁcation 2,2
-dihydroxy-
0
1,1
-dinaphthyldisulﬁde (IPA-3), which binds covalently to
the PAK1 regulatory domain and prevents binding to the
upstream activator, Cdc42 (49, 65). Although IPA-3 showed
high potency and slightly more selectivity for group I in
controlled experimental conditions, it was not effective
against preactivated group I kinases. Unfortunately, the
disulﬁde bond of this compound is likely to be reduced
under physiologic conditions; therefore, IPA-3 could be
an effective laboratory tool to explore group I PAK functions
but not useful for therapy (66).

To date, only a handful of endogenous or chemically
synthesized PAK1 inhibitors have been identiﬁed. The most
potent and selective PAK1 inhibitor developed so far is the
organometallic FL172 compound, which exhibits a favor-
able selectivity proﬁle as well as a potent ability to inhibit
PAK1 activity (66). On the basis of these ﬁndings, it is
expected that these inhibitors could be used in the treatment
of cancer as a monotherapy or in combination with the
commonly used chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Given that
PAK1 is widely expressed in a variety of normal tissues and
exhibits a large structural similarity to other members of the
PAK family, it is important to identify highly selective PAK1
inhibitors that can distinguish between group I and II PAKs
and selectively kill cancer cells without harming normal
cells. We should also take into account the potential drug
toxicity of PAK1 inhibitors due to their off-targeting effects
and the development of acquired resistance to PAK1 inhib-
itor therapy.

Conclusions

Since the discovery of PAK1 in the 1990s and its
well-established connection with cancer in 2000, inves-
tigators have made incredible progress in deﬁning the
signaling functions of PAK1 in oncogenic pathways,
as well as the mechanism of activation (Fig. 1). Several
recent studies have identiﬁed the role of PAK1 in human
cancer, as well as PAK1 modulators, such as the allo-
steric inhibitors, miRNA, organometallic compounds,
