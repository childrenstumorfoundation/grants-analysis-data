Abstract

The proper control of tissue growth is essential during normal development and an important problem in human disease.
Merlin, the product of the Neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene, has been extensively studied to understand its
functions in growth control. Here we describe experiments in which we used Drosophila as an in vivo system to test the
functions of the normal human NF2 gene products and patient-derived mutant alleles. Although the predominant NF2 gene
isoform, isoform 1, could functionally replace the Drosophila Merlin gene, a second isoform with a distinct C-terminal tail
could not. Immunofluorescence studies show that the two isoforms have distinct subcellular localizations when expressed
in the polarized imaginal epithelium, and function in genetic rescue assays correlates with apical localization of the NF2
protein. Interestingly, we found that a patient-derived missense allele, NF2L64P, appears to be temperature sensitive. These
studies highlight the utility of Drosophila for in vivo functional analysis of highly conserved human disease genes.

Introduction

sporadic cancers

Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)

is a dominantly inherited tumor
predisposition syndrome characterized by the formation of
schwannomas, meningiomas and other nervous system tumors
[1]. In addition, mutations in the NF2 gene have been associated
with non-neuronal,
such as mesothelioma,
suggesting that NF2 has tumor suppressor functions in a variety
tissues. NF2 encodes a membrane-associated cytoplasmic
of
protein, called Merlin, which contains a Four-point-one, Ezrin-
Radixin-Moesin (FERM) domain and is most closely related to the
ERM (Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin) proteins [2–4]. FERM domains are
believed to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane
proteins and bind other membrane-associated proteins [4,5]. Thus
Merlin likely acts at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane
[6], though some studies have suggested nuclear functions for
Merlin as well [7].

Previous studies have identified a well-conserved NF2 homo-
logue, called Merlin (Mer), in Drosophila [8]. Like its mammalian
counterparts, Drosophila Merlin has growth suppressive functions
as revealed by somatic mosaic analyses [9]. In addition, studies
have demonstrated that Merlin protein is associated with
endocytic processes, has functional interactions with Expanded,
another FERM domain containing tumor suppressor, and works
antagonistically to EGFR and other signaling pathways that
function to promote proliferation in developing epithelia [10–12].
Recent work has also implicated Merlin and Expanded as
the Hippo pathway [13,14], a well-
upstream regulators of
conserved kinase-signaling cascade that
is believed to control

tissue growth during development and regeneration. Studies in
mice indicate that Merlin also functions upstream of Hippo
signaling in mammals [15], although the mechanisms by which
Merlin regulates Hippo signaling might vary between different
organisms. In addition,
it is currently unclear whether all of
Merlin’s roles in tumor suppression are carried out through its
ability to regulate Hippo signaling, or whether it might have some
functions, such as regulation of EGFR accessibility at the cell
surface and junctional organization, that are independent of the
Hippo pathway [16,17].

Given the similarities in structure and function between fly and
mammalian genes and the utility of Drosophila genetics for
studying gene function, we reasoned that Drosophila would be a
valuable system in which to study the effects of splicing variants
and disease associated mutations in human NF2. Here we describe
functional analyses of an array of NF2 forms using transgenic
Drosophila as an in vivo ‘test tube’ for protein function. We show
that although the predominant NF2 isoform (Iso1) is able to rescue
the lethality associated with Drosophila Merlin null mutations, a
splice variant with a unique C-terminal tail does not. We find that
like Drosophila Merlin, human NF2 truncations still retain some,
albeit weak, function. In addition, we provide evidence that a well-
described severe patient derived mutation, NF2L64P, is a temper-
ature sensitive allele that retains significant functionality at non-
restrictive temperatures. Together these studies provide insights
into NF2 function and display the utility of Drosophila as an
orthologous system for analysis of human disease genes.

Materials and Methods

NF2 transgenes and genetic rescue experiments

Transgenes expressing the indicated NF2 proteins were cloned
with N-terminal Flag epitope tags in the pUASt transformation
vector. P-element
transformation [18] was used to generate
multiple stable transgenic lines for each NF2 allele tested. For
genetic rescue tests, at least three independent autosomal insertion
lines for each allele were crossed to female flies of the following
genotype, y w Mer4/FM7; T80-Gal4, and for each of these lines, a
sufficient number of offspring was scored to ensure that
the
predicted rescue class would number at least 40 flies. Percentage
genetic rescue was calculated from the ratio of surviving y w Mer4
hemizygous males over half of the total female offspring, thereby
avoiding the semi-lethality associated with the FM7 balancer
chromosome in males. The Mer4 chromosome was marked with y
to allow us to distinguish between rescued males (with yellow body
color) and males (normal body color) generated by patroclinous X
chromosome inheritance due to meiotic non-disjunction in FM7
females.

Immunofluorescence

Tissue dissection,

fixation and antibody staining were per-
formed as previously described [19]. Mouse anti-Flag (Sigma-
Aldrich) was used at 1:20,000 and guinea-pig anti-Merlin [8] was
used at 1:5000. Secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch)
were diluted 1:1000 and tissues were mounted in Prolong Antifade
(Molecular Probes). Confocal images were taken on either a Zeiss
LSM 410 or LSM 510 microscope using Zeiss acquisition software
(Carl Zeiss MicroImaging).

Analysis of wing phenotypes

The effect of ectopic expression of the NF2 isoforms under the
control of the apterous-Gal4 driver was examined in adult wings.
Wings were prepared by incubating flies in 70% EtOH, rinsing in
water, and then mounting the dissected wings in Aquamount
(BDH Laboratory Supplies). Wings were imaged under brightfield
optics on a Zeiss Axioplan 2ie compound microscope and
recorded using a Spot digital camera.

Quantitative PCR

Total RNA was prepared from 20 wing imaginal discs from
larvae of the following genotypes – ApGal4/+ (control), ApGal4/
P[hNF2Iso1]; P[hNF2Iso1]/+, ApGal4/+; (2X)P[hNF2Iso2]/+ - using
Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA was produced using the Taqman kit
(ABI) and quantitative PCR performed using the LightCycler
FastStart SYBR green system (Roche).

Results

Genetic rescue of Merlin mutations by NF2 alleles

We first asked if expression of the two known isoforms, NF2Iso1
and NF2Iso2 [20], could functionally replace the endogenous Merlin
gene in a transgenic rescue assay (Fig. 1). Isoform 1 has homology
with Drosophila Merlin and the ERM proteins along its entire
length. In contrast, isoform 2, which is formed by the insertion of
an exon near the 39 end of the coding sequence (exon 16) that
replaces the C-terminal 16 amino acids of isoform 1 with a novel
stretch of 11 amino acids, has a unique C-terminal
tail. All
transgenic constructs were Flag epitope tagged at
the amino
terminus (Fig. 1; Materials and Methods). Ability to rescue was
tested using ubiquitous expression via the Gal4/UAS system in
animals hemizygous for the Mer4 null allele, which severely
truncates the Merlin protein [9]. In all rescue experiments, at least

three independent NF2 transgenic lines of each construct were
tested to control for expression differences due to insertion site.
Also,
immunostaining using anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 2) and
immunoblot analysis (data not shown) were used to confirm
expression of all NF2 forms.

As shown in Table 1, expression of a transgene expressing
NF2Iso1 using the ubiquitously expressed T80 Gal4 driver [21]
substantially rescued the lethality of the null Mer4 allele, while
NF2Iso2 provided very poor rescue. Interestingly,
the rescue
provided by NF2Iso1 improved slightly with increased genetic dose,
while NF2Iso2 rescue seemed to decrease with increasing dosage.
This behavior would be expected for an allele with dominant
negative effects on the low levels of maternally encoded Merlin
found in Mer4 zygotes, and clearly indicates that isoform 2 has
significant functional differences from isoform 1 in this assay. This
conclusion is consistent with a recent study demonstrating an
isoform 2-specific neural function in the mouse [22].

Studies of NF2 patient families have identified a number of
point mutations in the NF2 gene. Most are nonsense mutations,
but there are a small number of known disease-causing missense
mutations that we reasoned could be used to provide insights into
structure/function relationships in the Merlin protein [23]. Given
that NF2Iso1 provides significant rescue of Mer null mutations in
flies, we generated transgenes carrying these disease-associated
NF2 alleles and tested their function in the rescue assay (Fig. 1;
Table 1). Interestingly, the NF2L64P missense mutation, which has
been proposed to be strongly inactivating [24], provided complete
genetic rescue in our assay. Another disease-associated mutation,
NF2K413E, showed reduced rescue ability in a dose sensitive
fashion, suggesting that it is hypomorphic for Merlin function.

To further analyze structure/function relationships in NF2, we
generated deletion transgenes and tested their ability to rescue
Merlin lethality. Multiple C-terminal deletions were tested -
deletions of the C-terminal half of Merlin (NF21-301, NF21-356),
and a disease associated nonsense mutation (NF2R466X). While
NF21-301 and a slightly larger form NF21-356 failed to provide
rescue at any dose, the NF2R466X allele, which encodes more of the

appear similar to that of isoform 1. The D2-3 deletion allele (I-J) appears
localized to the lateral cell cortex, somewhat similar to isoform 2, but
less strongly apically localized (arrows mark apical; also note staining
throughout the basolateral domain in I). NF21-356 (K–L) is substantially
cytoplasmic and fails to accumulate apically while NF2351-595 (M–N)
shows some apical enhancement (arrows in M). Both truncations
display substantial cytoplasmic localizations, as indicated by the
tangential views (compare L and N to J).

the higher level afforded by two copies of

C-terminal domain, rescued lethality moderately when expressed
at
the transgene
(Table 1). This observation suggests that this allele is hypomorphic
and is consistent with previous studies of Drosophila Merlin that
indicate that the C-terminal region of the protein contains non-
essential regulatory sequences [9,14]. In contrast, expression of the
C-terminal domain alone (NF2300-595 and NF2351-595) was not
sufficient to provide rescue. Expression of a form that lacks the
coding sequences provided by exons 2 and 3 (NF2D2-3), which has
been proposed to have dominant-negative activity [25], similarly
failed to provide any genetic rescue.

Subcellular localizations of NF2 proteins

To learn more about the functions of these NF2 transgenes, we
examined the subcellular localization of
their products when
expressed in the larval imaginal discs. These structures, which
produce adult appendages
such as wings and legs during
metamorphosis, consist of a single layered columnar epithelium
that displays a highly structured apical/basal epithelial polarity.
Merlin functions to control proliferation in these tissues, and the
Merlin protein is primarily localized to the apical membrane and
junctional domain [8,9]. NF2Iso1 expressed in the wing imaginal
epithelium under the apterous Gal4 (apGal4) driver was highly
concentrated at the apical domain, in a distinctly punctate pattern
(Fig. 2A–B).
In addition this protein localized to punctate
structures below the apical surface, consistent with previous
studies
indicating that Merlin is associated with endocytic
compartments [8,26]. NF2Iso2 was also apical, but lacked the
punctate appearance and instead was associated with cell
boundaries at the apical ends of epithelial cells (Fig. 2C–D). As
observed in the genetic rescue experiments (Table 1), this result
suggests significant functional differences between these two NF2
isoforms. Consistent with this, the two other proteins that provided
rescue, NF2L64P and NF2K413E, had subcellular
significant

distributions that were indistinguishable from that of NF2Iso1
(Fig. 2E–H). In contrast, NF2D2-3 was primarily associated with the
lateral cell cortex (Fig. 2 I–J) and the N- and C-terminal
truncations were more cytoplasmic in localization (Fig. 2 K–N).
Similar localizations were observed when the each transgene was
present in either one or two doses, indicating that differences in
expression level do not affect subcellular localization.

To better characterize the localizations of isoforms 1 and 2, we
co-stained for these proteins and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)
in the wing imaginal epithelium. Previous studies have shown that
aPKC is concentrated in the marginal zone, a region of the lateral
cell membrane just apical to the adherens junction, in these cells
[27,28]. As expected for a marginal zone component, aPKC
localized junctionally in the apical region of wing imaginal disc
cells (Fig. 3A,D). Strikingly, while NF2Iso1 was also predominantly
localized apically,
it did not show the same ‘fishnet’ staining
pattern observed for aPKC, and did not strongly colocalize with
aPKC (Fig. 3A–C). In contrast, NF2Iso2 staining was quite similar
to aPKC, and strongly colocalized with aPKC (Fig. 3D–F). These
staining patterns indicate that NF2Iso1 is distributed in a punctate,
non-junctional pattern across the apical cell cortex, while NF2Iso2
localizes primarily in the apical junctional region. Thus, there was
a correlation between punctate, apical localization and ability to
provide genetic rescue,

Effect of NF2 expression on endogenous Merlin

Previous studies of Merlin and the closely related ERM proteins
have demonstrated that these proteins display both homotypic and
heterotypic intermolecular interactions in vitro [29,30]. This led us
to ask if NF2 expression resulted in alterations in expression or
localization of endogenous Drosophila Merlin in these tissues.
Expressing NF2 in the dorsal half of the epithelium under the
apGal4 driver, allowed us to make side-by-side comparisons of

experiments, in which isoform 1 was expressed in a Mer4 null
mutant background, demonstrated that our anti-Drosophila
Merlin antiserum (raised against
the less conserved carboxyl
terminal half of the protein [8]) specifically recognized the fly
protein and did not cross react with human Merlin (data not
shown). We then used this antibody to compare Merlin
localization in cells
that express NF2 ectopically to Merlin
localization in normal epithelial cells. Expression of NF2Iso1,
which strongly rescued null Mer mutations (Table 1), affected both
the apparent amount and localization of endogenous Merlin. As
shown in Fig. 4, endogenous Merlin staining was much more
abundant in cells that express NF2Iso1. In addition, although
Drosophila Merlin is normally primarily junctional in imaginal
epithelial cells [8], it appeared localized to the apical cell cortex
with NF2Iso1 in cells expressing both proteins. This degree of
redistribution and colocalization suggests that Drosophila Merlin
and NF2Iso1 interact when expressed in these tissues. Imaginal
discs expressing NF2Iso2 also showed increased endogenous Merlin
staining in the dorsal compartment, though in this case Merlin was
predominantly associated with cell boundaries in the apical region
of cells, mirroring the difference we observed between NF2Iso1 and
NF2Iso2. Consistent with the idea that the effects of NF2 expression
on endogenous Merlin were posttranscriptional, quantitative PCR
analysis failed to show any detectable effect on Merlin transcrip-
tion in wing imaginal discs expressing either NF2 isoform under
the apGal4 driver (Table 2).

Dominant negative effects of NF2Iso2

To further test

the functions of

these NF2 transgenes in
developing Drosophila tissues, we examined their adult pheno-
types when expressed under the control of the apGal4 driver, which
is expressed only in the dorsal half of the wing imaginal disc. Our
previous work with Drosophila Merlin showed that overexpression

of a Mer
transgene in the wing has no phenotype [9]. However,
overexpression of NF2Iso1 did show some dominant phenotypes in

thereby demonstrating the specificity of anti-Flag staining in these tissues. Comparison to aPKC, a marker for the marginal zone in these cells (A,D),
demonstrates that NF2Iso1 (B–C) is expressed in the apical cell cortex but is not closely associated with the marginal zone. In contrast, NF2Iso2 (E–F) is
highly concentrated in the marginal zone together with aPKC.

assays (Table 1). In support of this notion, the severity of NF2Iso2

The NF2L64P allele is temperature sensitive

It was surprising to find that the NF2L64P mutation, a patient-
derived mutation [24], appeared to function equivalently to wild-
type NF2 in the genetic rescue assay (Table 1). This result is
particularly unexpected in light of studies that have reported
significant differences between wild-type and NF2L64P mutant
protein in mammalian cell-based functional assays due to
misfolding of the protein [23,24]. For these reasons, we speculated
that NF2L64P might be temperature sensitive and that
the
differences between observed NF2L64P function in mammalian
and Drosophila cells relate to the difference in temperature at

Figure 5. Ectopic expression of hNF2 isoforms 1 and 2 has different effects on Drosophila wing development. Two transgenic copies of
each isoform were expressed in the dorsal half of the developing wing blade under the control of the apterous-Gal4 driver. The apterous-Gal4 driver
itself has little or no effect on wing development (A–B), while expression of isoform 1causes some ectopic vein formation, particularly along the
second and fifth wing veins (C–D). Expression of isoform 2 (E–F) causes more severe ectopic vein formation that includes veins 2, 3 and 5. In addition,
expression of this isoform causes a downward cupping of the wing blade (data not shown).

which these organisms normally function – our in vivo Drosophila
assays are conducted at 25uC while mammalian cells are typically
cultured at 37uC. Because flies cannot survive when raised at
37uC, to test this possibility we expressed the NF2L64P transgene in
larval wing imaginal epithelial cells, pulsed the animals at 37uC for
two hours, and then used immunofluorescence staining to
determine the subcellular localization of the expressed protein.
Side by side comparison with either NF2L64P expressing animals
maintained at 25uC, or with animals expressing NF2Iso1 similarly
pulsed at 37uC, showed an obvious mislocalization of the mutant
protein at 37uC (Fig. 6). In particular, the punctate apical staining
is characteristic of NF2Iso1 was disrupted when animals
that
expressing the NF2L64P protein were maintained at 37uC for two
hours, and instead the mutant protein appeared largely cytoplas-
mic as observed previously in mammalian cells [31]. Given the
correlation between apical, punctate localization and functionality
in the rescue assay described above, these results strongly suggest
that NF2L64P is functional at 25uC but not at 37uC, and therefore
that this allele is temperature sensitive.

Discussion

Taken together, the results presented here reveal several aspects
of NF2/Merlin function relevant to its role in tumor suppression
and the evolutionary conservation of its functions. Our in vivo
studies in the fly reveal clear differences in genetic function and
subcellular localization in epithelial tissues between NF2 isoforms 1
and 2, which differ only in the C-terminal 16 amino acid residues.
This is particularly interesting in light of a recent study showing
that genetically deleting either isoform alone does not result in
lethality or increased tumor formation in mice [22] indicating
substantial functional redundancy between the two isoforms. In

expressed NF2 isoform 1 (A–B) and the L64P mutation (C–D) are
compared in wing imaginal discs kept at 25uC (A,C) or 37uC (B,D) for two
hours prior to dissection. While the L64P mutant protein shows normal
apical, punctate localization at 25uC (C), it is much more cytoplasmic
and evenly distributed at 37uC (D). In contrast, the higher temperature
has no apparent effect on subcellular distribution of the wild type
isoform 1 protein, which was apical and punctate at both temperatures
(A–B).

contrast, in flies isoform 2 is unable to compensate for loss of

endogenous Merlin activity in restricting proliferation in the wing
epithelium. Thus, our results suggest that isoform 2 could, at least
in some contexts, antagonize isoform 1 function in proliferating
tissues. This activity could be regulated through interactions with
other proteins, consistent with previous studies that have identified
isoform-specific NF2 binding partners [22,32,33]. Indeed, Schulz
et al. [22] demonstrate that isoform 2, but not isoform 1, forms a
complex with RhoGDI and promotes RhoA activation in neurons.
This function is also unlikely to be recapitulated in fly cells because
the phenotypes in the wing we observed from ectopic expression of
isoform 2 (Fig. 4) do not resemble those previously described for
increased Rho1 function [34].

An interesting implication of these studies relates to the question
of how well Merlin function has been conserved evolutionarily. At
the protein level, Merlin is 55% identical between flies and
mammals [8], and as we have shown here, NF2 can genetically
rescue null Merlin mutations in flies. Recent work in flies has
strongly implicated Merlin as an upstream regulator of the Hippo
pathway, and suggests that all Merlin functions in growth control
are mediated through its effects on Hippo signaling. In mamma-
lian cells it is less clear whether all Merlin functions are directly
related to the Hippo pathway [17], though it seems that at least
some of them are [15]. Whether some of this functional diversity is
due to isoform 2, which is unique to mammals, remains to be seen,
but its unique properties are consistent with this possibility.

Strikingly, the NF2L64P allele, which is reported to be a strongly
inactivating allele in humans [24], displays essentially wild-type
genetic rescue and subcellular localization in Drosophila reared at
25uC, suggesting that
this missense mutation is temperature
sensitive. Consistent with this, we found that while normal at
25uC, localization of NF2L64P was dramatically altered at 37uC.
Similar behavior has been seen previously for other disease-
causing mutations [35,36]. If correct, then our model for NF2L64P
suggests that approaches based on correcting protein folding

NF2 Functional Analysis in Flies

defects might be therapeutically effective for treating this disease
causing mutation in the NF2 gene. A second disease related allele
we examined, NF2K413E, appeared hypomorphic in our in vivo
assays, while a previous study in mammalian cells indicated that it
severely affects NF2 function [24]. This allele could also be
temperature sensitive, though it is also possible that this functional
distinction simply reflects the differences in the assays used in the
two studies.

Our studies suggest a strong relationship between subcellular
localization in polarized epithelial cells and proper NF2 protein
function. All NF2 proteins providing genetic rescue in flies,
NF2Iso1, NF2K413E, and NF2L64P, localize to the apical cell cortex
in the imaginal epithelium. Interestingly, we observed that two
dominant negative NF2 proteins, NF2Iso2 and NF2D2-3 [25], are
predominantly localized to the lateral plasma membrane, as is true
for the dominant negative delta-blue-box allele of fly Merlin [9].
Based on these results, and previous studies in mammals that
indicate that Merlin functions to regulate both receptor availability
[11,37] and Hippo pathway activity [38,39] at cell junctions, we
infer that normal Merlin function is dependent on its ability to
localize, at least transiently, to both the apical membrane and the
junctional region, and that Merlin might normally traffic between
these membrane domains.
