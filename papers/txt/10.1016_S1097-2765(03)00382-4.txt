Summary

The Nf2 tumor suppressor gene codes for merlin, a
protein whose function has been elusive. We describe
a novel interaction between merlin and p21-activated
kinase 1 (Pak1), which is dynamic and facilitated upon
increased cellular confluence. Merlin inhibits the acti-
vation of Pak1, as the loss of merlin expression results
in the inappropriate activation of Pak1 under condi-
tions associated with low basal activity. Conversely,
the overexpression of merlin in cells that display a high
basal activity of Pak1 resulted in the inhibition of Pak1
activation. This inhibitory function of merlin is medi-
ated through its binding to the Pak1 PBD and by inhib-
iting Pak1 recruitment to focal adhesions. This link
provides a possible mechanism for the effect of loss
of merlin expression in tumorigenesis.

Introduction

Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited disorder, char-
acterized by development of Schwann cell tumors of
the eighth cranial nerve. Mutations and loss of heterozy-
gosity of the NF2 locus have been detected at high
frequency in various tumors of the nervous system, in-
cluding schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymo-
mas (Gusella et al., 1999). Mice heterozygous for an Nf2
mutation are predisposed to a wide variety of malignant
tumors (McClatchey et al., 1998). Inactivation of Nf2
specifically in Schwann cells leads to development of
schwannomas and Schwann cell hyperplasia in mice
(Giovannini et al., 2000). The NF2 gene codes for a 595
amino acid protein, termed merlin, which is highly re-
lated to the ERM proteins ezrin, radixin, and moesin.

Recent work has shown that merlin protein levels and
phosphorylation are affected by growth conditions such
as cell confluence, loss of adhesion, or serum depriva-
tion. One site of phosphorylation of merlin is serine 518,
and phosphorylation at this site can be induced by active
forms of Rac and cdc42 but not Rho (Shaw et al., 2001).
Rac/cdc42-induced phosphorylation at merlin serine
518 is mediated by p21-activated kinase (Pak) (Kissil et
al., 2002; Xiao et al., 2002). Such phosphorylation can
disrupt merlin intramolecular interactions and its associ-
ation with the actin cytoskeleton and induces a shift in
the subcellular localization of merlin in LLC-PK1 cells
(Kissil et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 2001).

The p21-activated kinases (Pak1 through 3) are imme-
diate downstream effectors of Rac/cdc42. They com-
prise a subgroup of serine/theronine kinases, termed
the “group I” Paks, belonging to a larger protein family,
which also contains the “group II” kinases (Pak4, 5, and
6). The group I Paks, which have been studied in more
detail, have been shown to mediate signals to cytoskele-
tal reorganization and transcriptional activation (reviewed
by Bagrodia and Cerione, 1999; Jaffer and Chernoff,
2002). The Paks are regulated by diverse mechanisms.
Based on three-dimensional structure analysis, it has
been suggested that inactive Pak is in a conformation
in which the autoinhibitory domain interacts with the
kinase domain. The binding of active Rac/cdc42 to Pak
alleviates this inhibition and enables Pak activation.
Once the inhibition is relieved, Pak undergoes autophos-
phorylation, and this prevents a conformational switch
back into an inactive state (Li et al., 2001). Several addi-
tional mechanisms and molecules have been shown to
regulate Pak activation, including phospholipids and
proteolysis. In addition, membrane localization via NCK,
localization to focal adhesions via p95/PKL-Cool/Pix,
and signals converging from both growth factor recep-
tors and integrins can all effect Pak activation (Brown
et al., 2002; del Pozo et al., 2000; Turner et al., 1999).
Recently, merlin has been implicated as a negative
regulator of Rac signaling. The overexpression of merlin
inhibited Rac-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal ki-
nase (JNK) and activation of the AP-1 transcriptional
activator. Conversely, in Nf2-deficient fibroblasts, basal
JNK activity was found to be elevated, as was the activity
of AP-1 (Shaw et al., 2001). Thus, it would seem that
merlin both is regulated by the Rac/cdc42 signaling
pathway and can serve as an inhibitor of this pathway.
Here we describe the interaction of merlin with Pak1, a
critical mediator of Rac/cdc42 signaling, and the effect
of this interaction on the activity of the kinase.

Results and Discussion

Direct Interaction between Merlin and Pak1
Based on the observations that merlin inhibits Rac sig-
naling at some level, we assessed the possibility of a
stable interaction between merlin and Pak. NIH3T3 cells
were cotransfected with expression vectors for merlin
and Pak1, and association of the proteins was assessed
by coimmunoprecipitations. As shown in Figure 1A, im-
munoprecipitation of merlin led to coimmunoprecipita-
tion of Pak1. Likewise, immunoprecipitates of Pak1 con-
tained merlin (Figure 1A). To assess the interaction in
an additional cell type, a rat schwannoma cell line (RT4-
DP6) was examined. These cells express relatively low
levels of endogenous merlin and detectable endoge-
nous levels of Pak1. Neither Pak2 nor Pak3 was detected
in these cells by Western blot analysis (data not shown).
As in the case of NIH3T3 cells, association of the proteins
was assessed by coimmunoprecipitations. As shown in
Figure 1A, the immunoprecipitation of merlin also pre-
cipitated endogenous Pak1. In the reciprocal experi-

ment, the immunoprecipitation of endogenous Pak1
also resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of endoge-
nous or exogenous merlin (Figure 1A).

To determine if merlin and Pak can interact directly,
the association of the two proteins was assessed in
vitro. Full-length Pak1 was produced in bacteria as a
GST-fusion protein and purified on glutathione- agarose
beads. Merlin was produced by in vitro transcription/
translation. The S35-labeled merlin protein was incu-
bated with either GST-Pak1 or GST bound to the agarose
beads. The interaction of the proteins was assessed by
separation of the proteins by SDS-PAGE and autoradi-
ography. As shown in Figure 1B, GST-Pak1 bound to
merlin, whereas GST alone did not. Thus, the interaction
between Pak and merlin is likely to be direct.

To further delineate the regions of Pak1 that mediate
interaction with merlin, we assessed the binding of dif-
ferent merlin domains to full length Pak1 in vitro. The
N-terminal FERM domain (1–313) and the C-terminal tail
of merlin (314–595) were transcribed and translated in
vitro and tested for their ability to interact with GST-
Pak1. While the N-terminal FERM domain interacted
efficiently with GST-Pak1, the C-terminal fragment failed
to interact (Figure 1B). This was not due to different
levels of expression, as all merlin fragments were pro-
duced at similar levels (data not shown). Trying to further
narrow down the interacting domains in the merlin

FERM, we tested the ability of either the F1-F2 domain
(1–217) or the F3 domain (218–313) (Pearson et al., 2000)
to bind to Pak1. Both domains interacted well with the
kinase, indicating there are multiple binding sites in the
FERM domain involved in the interaction of merlin with
Pak1 (Figure 1B). The interaction of both the F1-F2 and
F3 fragments with GST-Pak1 appeared to be stronger
than that of the entire FERM domain (F1-F3). This could
be due to intramolecular associations within the intact
FERM domain (Gutmann et al., 1999) that partially mask
the Pak1 interaction sites. We next tested the possibil-
ity that the FERM domain could bind to the N-terminal
regulatory domain of Pak1 (70–143), which contains the
cdc42/Rac binding domain (PBD). The FERM domain
interacted with the PBD, although the interaction was
weaker than the interaction with full-length Pak1.

We attempted to identify additional merlin binding
sites on Pak1 by generating additional truncation mu-
tants; however, we were unable to obtain these mutants
due to the high toxicity of the Pak1 kinase domain in
bacteria (J. Chernoff and E. Manser, personal communi-
cation). Thus, it remains possible that additional interac-
tion domains exist between merlin and Pak1. However,
the identification of an interaction between the FERM
domain with the PBD is of functional significance, as it
implicates merlin in a regulatory role for Pak1 (see
below).

The Interaction of Merlin and Pak Is Dynamic
To assess whether the interaction between Pak and
merlin is dynamic, we examined the effect of cell adhe-
sion and confluence on the interaction. Exogenous ex-
pression of merlin was employed in these experiments
to circumvent the fact that merlin expression is regulated
by different cellular growth conditions (Shaw et al., 1998).
Toward this aim, the RT4-67 cell line was employed.
The RT4-67 cells were constructed from the RT4-DP6 rat
schwannoma cells and harbor a tetracycline-inducible
allele of NF2 (Morrison et al., 2001). RT4-67 cells were
grown in the presence of doxycycline and placed into
suspension by plating them on poly-HEME coated
dishes, which prevents the cells from adhering to the
plastic (Folkman and Moscona, 1978). Four hours after
being placed into suspension, the cells were harvested,
and either merlin or Pak1 was immunoprecipitated. The
precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting and compared to precipitates from adherent
RT4-67 cells. While merlin and Pak1 could be coimmu-
noprecipitated under adherent growth conditions, the
interaction between the two proteins was greatly en-
hanced when adhesion was lost (Figure 1D).

To test the effect of cell confluence on the merlin-
Pak1 interaction, protein extracts were prepared from
RT4-67 cells grown at high or low confluence. The cells
were plated at increasing densities in the presence of
doxycycline and were harvested 24 hr after plating. Mer-
lin or Pak1 was immunoprecipitated from the cellular
extracts and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Both merlin and
Pak1 can reciprocally coimmunoprecipitate under con-
ditions of either low or high confluence. However, the
interaction between merlin and Pak1 was enhanced
when cells were grown to a higher density (Figure 1E).
Importantly, the observed differences in the precipitated
levels of merlin or Pak1 are not due to differences in the
expression levels of these proteins. The levels merlin
and Pak1 were not altered in the RT4-67 Schwann cells,
whether the cells were adherent or nonadherent or
grown at high or low cellular densities.

These experiments indicate that the interaction of
merlin and Pak1 is dynamic and influenced by cellular
adhesion and cell density. The interaction of merlin and
Pak was enhanced under conditions demonstrated to
be inhibitory to Pak activation in NIH3T3 cells (del Pozo
et al., 2000) and in the RT4-67 Rat schwannoma cells
(J.L.K. and T.J., unpublished data). The regulation of the
Paks is complex and involves many different factors
(discussed below). However, the localization of Pak to
specific regions at the plasma membrane might be an
important determinant of its activation. Earlier work has
shown that the SH2/SH3 domain protein NCK is required
for the recruitment of Pak to the cell membrane (Lu et
al., 1997; Sells et al., 1997). Interestingly, NCK interaction
with Pak is enhanced upon adhesion and lost when cells
are suspended (Howe, 2001), which is opposite to the
pattern of interaction of merlin and Pak shown here.

Merlin Inhibits the Pak1-Rac and
Pak1-Paxillin Interactions
As merlin bound the Pak1 PBD domain, we tested the
possibility that merlin can inhibit the interaction between
Rac and Pak1. RT4-67 cells were grown in the presence

or absence of doxycycline, and Pak1-Rac interaction
was examined by immnuoprecipitations. Overexpres-
sion of merlin inhibited the interaction between Pak1
and Rac, as demonstrated by the reduced levels of Rac
coimmunoprecipitated with Pak1 and vice versa. The
overall reduction in this interaction was approximately
4-fold in the presence of merlin (Figure 2A). While the
levels of Rac1 were not altered in the presence or ab-
sence of merlin (Figure 2A), the levels of the GTP-bound
form of Rac1 were decreased by approximately 2-fold
in cells expressing merlin (Figure 2A). These reduced
levels of Rac-GTP could explain in part the lower levels
of Rac-Pak1 complexes in the presence of merlin.

We also examined the effect of merlin expression on
the interactions of Pak1 with other adaptor proteins.
This was done by immunoprecipitation and Western blot
analysis of the relevant interactions. Merlin expression
did not affect the interaction between Pak1 and NCK,
Pak1 and ␤-pix, or Pak1 and p95PKL, as similar amounts
of Pak1 and the various binding proteins were coimmu-
noprecipitated in the presence or absence of increased
merlin expression (Figures 3B–3D). Merlin expression
also did not alter the overall expression levels of these
proteins (data not shown). In contrast, the interaction
of Pak1 and paxillin was greatly reduced upon increased
merlin expression (Figure 3A). When merlin was overex-
pressed in the RT4-67 cell lines, an average of 10-fold
reduction in the Pak1-paxillin interaction was evident
from the reduced levels of paxillin coimmunoprecipi-
tated with Pak1 and vice versa. Again, expression of
merlin did not affect the overall levels of paxillin or Pak1
expression in the cells (Figure 3A).

Based on these observations, we propose that merlin
can inhibit Pak1 activation by binding directly to the
Pak1 PBD and interfere with the binding of active Rac
to the Pak1 PBD. Merlin might also function by directly
reducing the level of active Rac1 that is available to
bind and activate Pak1. Similarly, merlin could interfere
directly with the interaction of Pak1 to paxillin, or this
effect could be a consequence in the reduction of active
Rac, which is required for the recruitment of Pak1 to
focal adhesion complexes (Brown et al., 2002).

Loss of Merlin Results in Increased Pak Activity
We next tested the possibility that merlin expression
might affect Pak1 activation. The phosphorylation status
of Pak1 serves as a direct indication of the activation
status of the kinase (Buchwald et al., 2001; Chong et
al., 2001). To examine differences in the phosphorylation
state of Pak1, we used 2-dimensional gel analysis to
separate the different forms of activated Pak1 (Garcia
Arguinzonis et al., 2002). MEFs were serum starved for
24 hr and then treated for 5 min with PDGF. Extracts
were prepared from cells directly into sample buffer and
quantified. Equal amounts of protein were separated by
isoelectric focusing on an immobilized 4–7 pH gradient.
Subsequently, the extracts were separated by SDS-
PAGE in the second dimension, transferred to mem-
branes, and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-
Pak1 antibody. As shown in Figure 4B, under conditions
of serum starvation only two forms of Pak1 were de-
tected in the extracts, most likely corresponding to non-
or hypophosphorylated forms of Pak1. When extracts

prepared from PDGF-treated MEFs were examined, how-
ever, several additional spots were detected. These spots
correspond to hyperphosphorylated forms of Pak1, as
they appear to be more acidic than the forms of Pak1
found in the serum-starved cells and separate in a signa-
ture pattern of a phospho-protein with multiple phos-
phorylation sites (Garcia Arguinzonis et al., 2002). This
also correlated with the increased kinase activity of
Pak1, as assessed directly by an in vitro kinase assay
employing MBP (myelin basic protein) as a substrate
(Figure 4A). To confirm that the additional Pak1 forms
are due to phosphorylation, extracts of PDGF-treated
cells were incubated with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)
in the presence or absence of protein phosphatase in-
hibitors. The protein phosphatase treatment resulted in
the disappearance of the additional acidic forms of the
protein that appear after the PDGF treatment (see Figure
4B), indicating that the additional spots appearing after
PDGF stimulation are phosphorylated forms of Pak1. As
expected, the inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors in the

reaction prevented the loss of the phosphorylated spe-
cies (data not shown).

To address the effect of merlin on Pak1 activation in
vivo, the consequence of loss of merlin expression in
MEFs was examined. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs)
were prepared from animals carrying a conditional
knockout (floxed) allele of Nf2 (Nf2flox2) (Giovannini et al.,
2000). In addition to the Nf2flox2 allele, the cells carried
either a wild-type Nf2 allele (Nf2flox2/⫹) or a Nf2 deletion
allele (Nf2flox2/⫺) (McClatchey et al., 1998). The MEFs were
then infected with adenovirus expressing Cre-recombi-
nase (ad-Cre), which led to the inactivation of the floxed
Nf2 allele. To test for loss of merlin expression in the
ad-Cre treated Nf2flox2/⫺ MEFs, extracts were prepared
96 hr after infection. One milligram of extract was used
to immunoprecipitate merlin, and merlin levels were ex-
amined by Western blotting. The ad-Cre-treated Nf2flox2/⫺
MEFs lacked detectable merlin protein 96 hr after in-
fection, while merlin levels were not altered in ad-Cre
Nf2flox2/⫹ MEFs (Figure 5B). As a control, infection of the

cells with an adenovirus expressing the LacZ gene did
not alter merlin levels (data not shown). The status of
Pak1 was then analyzed in the MEFs. The ad-Cre-
treated and adenovirus control-treated Nf2flox2/⫺ and ad-
Cre-treated Nf2flox2/⫹ MEFs were plated at the same cellu-
lar densities and allowed to adhere to the tissue culture
dish. The MEFs were then serum starved for 24 hr and
extracted into sample buffer, and the status of Pak1
phosphorylation was analyzed by 2D gel analysis. Under
conditions of serum starvation, Pak1 was not activated
in control-treated MEFs, as demonstrated by detection
of only hypophosphorylated forms of Pak1 (Figure 5A).
However, in the ad-Cre treated Nf2flox2/⫺ MEFs, which
had lost the expression of merlin, a marked activation
of Pak1 was observed, as indicated by the appearance
of several phosphorylated forms of the kinase (Figure
5A). Thus, loss of merlin expression in MEFs promoted
Pak1 activation under conditions normally associated
with inactivity. These data are consistent with merlin
functioning as an inhibitor of Pak1.

Merlin Expression Inhibits Pak Activation
As loss of merlin expression resulted in the appearance
of activated forms of Pak1, we examined the possibility
that the overexpression of merlin would inhibit Pak1
activation. In the RT4-67 Schwann cells basal levels of
merlin are extremely low (Morrison et al., 2001). To as-
sess Pak1 activity in these cells, RT4-67 cells were se-
rum starved for 24 hr, protein was extracted, and the
activation status of Pak1 was examined by 2D gel analy-
sis. As shown in Figure 5C, the basal activity of Pak1
was relatively high in the RT4 cells. To assess whether
the expression of merlin would affect the activity of Pak1
in these cells, the expression of merlin was induced by
the addition of doxycycline into the growth media 48 hr
prior to the harvesting of the cells, in the same manner
as described above. Indeed, increased expression of
merlin significantly reduced the levels of activated forms

of Pak1 (Figure 5C). Thus, the reintroduction of merlin
into the RT4 schwannoma cells, which display a high
level of basal Pak1 activity, results in inhibition of Pak1 ac-
tivation.

The data reported here are in agreement with previous
work from us and others implicating merlin as a negative
regulator of Rac-signaling. Specifically, overexpression
of merlin has been shown to inhibit Rac-induced activa-
tion of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AP-1 transcrip-
tion, while loss of merlin further resulted in elevated JNK
basal activity and activation of AP-1. Loss of merlin also
induced cytoskeleton changes that are phenotypically
consistent with Rac activation, including membrane ruf-
fling and increased cellular motility (Shaw et al., 2001).
This is similar to the higher motility of cells expressing
activated Rac alleles. While these data support a func-
tional connection between merlin and Rac, they do not
establish where in the Rac pathway merlin might act.
Our data indicate that merlin can act both at the level
of Rac activation and downstream of Rac, at the level
of Pak activation.

The overexpression of Rac can induce transformation
and anchorage-independent growth of cells (Khosravi-
Far et al., 1995; Qiu et al., 1995). As Rac effectors, PAKs
have been shown to mediate some of these signals.
Using activated or dominant-negative forms of the pro-
teins, the Paks have been shown to be involved in focal
complex formation and membrane ruffling in various cell
types (Daniels et al., 1998; Manser et al., 1997; Sells et
al., 1997). Paks also have a role in signal transduction
from Rac to JNK. Some reports have concluded that
activated Pak1 or Pak3 can lead to upregulation of JNK
activity; however, further studies are required to fully
establish this connection (Brown et al., 1996; Zhang et
al., 1995). In addition, recent data point to involvement
of Pak in the regulation of the MAPK pathway. Pak can
phosphorylate Raf-1 on serine 338 and induce phos-
phorylation of Mek1 on serine 298 (Diaz et al., 1997;
Frost et al., 1997; King et al., 1998). Moreover, Rac or

cdc42 has been reported to be required for the full acti-
vation of Ras by Raf. Pak may mediate the effect of
Rac/cdc42 through phosphorylation of Raf (Li et al.,
2001; Macara et al., 1996).

Merlin might exert its inhibitory function by several
different mechanisms, which could be overlapping. As
we have shown, expression of merlin in the RT-4 induc-
ible cell line resulted in reduced levels of Rac-GTP, with-
out affecting the levels of total Rac1. Merlin, interest-
ingly, binds RhoGDI (Maeda et al., 1999) and therefore
may link between RhoGDI and Rac1, thus stabilizing the
inactive state of Rac1. Alternatively, merlin might act by
affecting the activity of ␤-pix, which is a Rac GEF (Manser
et al., 1998). We have also demonstrated here that merlin
binds to the PBD domain of Pak1, and this interaction
could well disrupt association with Rac and the subse-
quent activation of Pak1.

The localization of Pak is important in the regulation of
its activity. Pak1 activation requires signals converging
from both growth factor receptors and integrins. One
possible site of physical integration of these pathways
is the scaffold protein paxillin (Turner, 2000). Pak has
been shown to bind to paxillin via the p95PKL-Cool/Pix
protein complex (Turner et al., 1999). The recruitment

of Pak1-PIX-p95PKL to paxillin is triggered by binding
of Rac-GTP to Pak1 and activation of the adaptor func-
tion of Pak1 (Brown et al., 2002). We have demonstrated
that merlin interferes with the Pak1-paxillin interaction,
but does not affect the interaction between Pak1 and
␤-pix, p95PKL, or NCK. It is probable that NCK and p95/
PKL-Cool/Pix target Pak to different subcellualr loca-
tions, where Pak is activated by different stimuli. Thus, it
is possible that merlin can specifically inhibit the cellular
fraction of Pak1 that is to be recruited to focal adhesion
complexes. Interestingly, merlin has been demonstrated
to bind to paxillin and to ␤-integrin (Fernandez-Valle et
al., 2002; Obremski et al., 1998). Therefore, merlin may
bind Pak while it is bound to paxillin and act to both
release it from paxillin and inhibit its full activation by
Rac. Alternatively, there could exist separate pools of
merlin with distinct functions. One pool of merlin may
function by binding to Pak1 prior to its association with
paxillin and prevent the association. Another fraction of
merlin, which is associated with paxillin, might have
other, additional functions. The existence of pools of
merlin with different functions can be demonstrated with
the identification of merlin mutants impaired in their abil-
ity to bind Pak1 and the functional comparison of these

Merlin Inhibition of p21-Activated Kinase

mutants with the mutants of merlin unable to bind paxil-
lin (Fernandez-Valle et al., 2002). It is important to note
that the localization and function of merlin is also likely
to be affected by phosphorylation at serine 518 (Kissil
et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 2001). The effects of different
merlin mutants, including those affecting serine 518, on
the interaction with and inhibition of Pak are currently
being investigated.

The data described here, combined with the fact that
Pak phosphorylates and, perhaps, inactivates merlin
supports a “feedforward” signaling model (Kissil et al.,
2002; Xiao et al., 2002). In such a model, merlin would
function normally to downregulate Rac/cdc42-induced
signaling. Once activated, Rac/cdc42 can stimulate Pak
activity, which in turn would lead to merlin phosphoryla-
tion and relief from its inhibitory effect. Given the fact
that Rac signaling is necessary, and in some cases suffi-
cient, for transformation, it is possible that merlin’s inhi-
bition of Rac/cdc42-signaling represents its tumor sup-
pressor function. Studies employing dominant-negative
mutants have shown that Rac is required for cellular
transformation by Ras (Khosravi-Far et al., 1995; Qiu et
al., 1995; Ridley et al., 1992; Roux et al., 1997). Rac has
also been shown to regulate cell motility and invasive-
ness (del Peso et al., 1997; Evers et al., 2000; Habets
et al., 1994; Sahai et al., 2001). The fact that Nf2⫹/⫺ mice
develop highly metastatic tumors, which display loss of
the wild-type Nf2 allele, is also consistent with a merlin-
Rac functional connection (McClatchey et al., 1998).

The data presented here demonstrate a direct con-
nection between merlin and the Rac-signaling pathways,
via the inhibition of Pak. The work ascribes a biochemi-
cal function to a tumor suppressor with previously un-
known function. In addition, it identifies an established
tumor suppressor in the process of Pak1 regulation,
possibly linking Pak deregulation to tumorigenesis. Un-
derstanding the regulation of merlin by Rac/cdc42 and
merlin’s impact on these signaling pathways could lead
to a more complete understanding for the role of merlin
in tumor formation. Once these interactions are fully
elucidated, the use of specific inhibitors can be assessed
as therapeutic modalities for tumors bearing mutations
in NF2.

Experimental Procedures

Cell Culture Conditions and Transfections
The RT4 Schwann cells and MEFs were grown in DME, 10% fetal
calf serum, and antibiotics. In cases where merlin expression was
involved, expression was induced by addition of 1 ␮g/ml Doxycy-
cline for 48 hr prior to the experiment. All transfections were done
with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). For the experiments where Pak1
activation was examined, cells were serum starved by growing them
for 24 hr in serum-free DME and antibiotics. Pak1 activation was
stimulated by adding PDGF-BB (Sigma) at 5 ng/ml for 5 min. In
experiments where cells were in suspension, tissue culture plates
were coated with poly-HEME (Sigma) as previously described (Folk-
man and Moscona, 1978). Cells were trypsinized, treated with soy-
bean Trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and placed back onto regular tissue
culture dishes or the poly-HEME coated plates for 4 hr before har-
vesting.

constructed by PCR of the FERM domain (1–313), C-terminal half
(342–595), F1-F2 (1–217), and F3 (218–313) (sequences available
upon request) and subcloning of the fragments into pCDNA3. Anti-
bodies used were: for merlin, SC-331; Pak1, sc-881 and sc-882;
␤-pix, sc-10932; Nck, sc-290; Rac1, sc-217 (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy); anti-paxillin mAb, anti-Rac1 mAb and anti-p95PKL mAb (BD
Transduction Laboratories), and anti-paxillin pAb (Chemicon Inter-
national).

Immunoprecipitations, Kinase Assays, and Rac Activation Assays
Cells were plated at 7.5 ⫻ 105/10 cm dish and transfected the next
day. 48 hr after transfection the cells were serum starved for 24 hr
and extracted into extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150
mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1 mM NaVO4, and prote-
ase inhibitors). Lysates were precleared for 1 hr, then incubated
with the primary antibody for 3 hr at 4⬚C, and protein-A or protein-G
beads were added for an additional 2 hr. Complexes were washed
extensively with extraction buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE.
Pak1 kinase assays were preformed as described (Kissil et al., 2002),
except that Pak1 was immunoprecipitated from the extracts and
MBP was added as substrate at 0.5 ␮g/ml. Quantification of active
Rac was done employing the Rac activation assay kit, according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Upstate). Quantification of all Western
blot experiments was done by densitometry analysis using NIH im-
age v.1.63 of scanned data from at least three independent experi-
ments.

In Vitro Binding Assays
Full-length and truncation mutants of merlin were produced using
the TnT kit (Promega) with Methionine S35. GST-Pak1 and GST-
Pak1(70-143) were produced in bacteria as described (Thiel et al.,
2002). The in vitro binding assays were preformed by incubation of
30 ␮l of GST, GST-Pak1, or GST-Pak1(70-143) bound to gluthathione
beads (0.5 mg/ml) with equal amounts of in vitro translated merlin-
S35 (determined beforehand by running 5% of each reaction on SDS-
PAGE and autoradiography) in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH
7.5], 120 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100)
at 4⬚C for 3 hr and washed several times with the reaction buffer.
The beads were then boiled, separated by SDS-PAGE, treated with
Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia), dried, and exposed to film.

2-Dimensional Analysis of Pak1 Activity
Cells were harvested directly into sample buffer (9.8 M Urea, 2%
CHAPS, 5 ml IPG buffer 4-7, DTT 15 mg/ml). Extracts were incubated
on ice for 10 min and centrifuged 10 min, 14,000 ⫻ g, 4⬚C. Extracts
(100 ␮g) were cup loaded onto 7 cm, pH 4–7 IPG strips (Amersham
Pharmacia) and resolved at 50 mA/strip for 100V for 30 min, 200V
for 30 min, 400V for 30 min, 1000V for 60 min, 3500V for 5 hr, and
500V to a total of 20,000V·hours using a IPGphor unit (Pharmacia
biotech). Strips were then washed in wash solution (50 mM Tris-
HCl [pH 8.8], 6 M Urea, 30% Glycerol, 2% SDS) supplemented with
20 mg/ml DTT for 10 min at RT and followed by a wash in wash
buffer supplemented with 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide for 10 min. The
strips were then loaded onto a standard SDS-PAGE, separated, and
transferred to Immobilon (Millipore). The blots were then used in
Western blot analysis. Equal loading of protein was determined by
blotting with an actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
