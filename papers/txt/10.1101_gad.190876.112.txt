The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) path-
way plays a critical role in transducing mitogenic signals
from receptor tyrosine kinases. Loss-of-function muta-
tions in one feedback regulator of Ras/MAPK signaling,
SPRED1 (Sprouty-related protein with an EVH1 domain),
cause Legius syndrome, an autosomal dominant human
disorder that resembles Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1). Spred1
functions as a negative regulator of the Ras/MAPK path-
way; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is
poorly understood. Here we show that neurofibromin, the
NF1 gene product, is a Spred1-interacting protein that is
necessary for Spred1’s inhibitory function. We show that
Spred1 binding induces the plasma membrane localiza-
tion of NF1, which subsequently down-regulates Ras-GTP
levels. This novel mechanism for the regulation of neuro-
fibromin provides a molecular bridge for understanding the
overlapping pathophysiology of NF1 and Legius syndrome.

Spred1 (Sprouty-related protein with an EVH1 domain)
functions as a negative regulator of growth factor, cyto-
kine, and chemokine-induced ERK activation by specifi-
cally inhibiting the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (Wakioka
et al. 2001; Miyoshi et al. 2004; Nonami et al. 2004).
Spred1 is comprised of an N-terminal Ena/Vasp homology
1 (EVH1) domain, a central c-Kit-binding domain (KBD),
and a cysteine rich C-terminal Sprouty (SPR) domain.
Mammals contain three homologs, Spred 1, Spred 2, and
Spred 3, each of which can negatively regulate the Ras/
Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
(Kato et al. 2003; King et al. 2006). However, the precise
mechanism by which the Spreds act remains unclear, and

it has been reported to function both upstream of and
downstream from Ras (Wakioka et al. 2001; King et al.
2005). Overexpression of Spred1 can increase Raf’s re-
cruitment to the plasma membrane, where it associates
with Ras without stimulating Raf activation (Wakioka
et al. 2001). Yet, this mechanism has never been fully
refined and fails to explain how Spred1 prevents Raf ac-
tivation. A separate report suggests that Spred1 may pre-
vent Ras activation, as evidenced by decreased Ras-GTP
levels when Spred1 is overexpressed (King et al. 2005).

Heterozygous germline loss-of-function mutations have
been identified in SPRED1 in Legius syndrome, a develop-
mental disorder that shares a number of phenotypes with
Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) (Brems et al. 2007). Both syn-
dromes are characterized as rasopathies, congenital devel-
opmental syndromes caused by germline mutations that
affect the Ras/MAPK pathway. Legius syndrome has been
characterized as a milder form of NF1, with individuals
displaying multiple cafe´ -au-lait spots, axillary freckling,
and macrocephaly, but lacking other common NF1 man-
ifestations such as Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, osseous
lesions, or optic pathway gliomas. Initial experiments re-
vealed that Spred1 mutations were loss-of-function muta-
tions, incapable of inhibiting the Ras/MAPK pathway
(Brems et al. 2007). SPRED1 mutations account for at
least 2% of the pathogenic mutations associated with
patients clinically diagnosed with NF1 (Brems et al. 2007;
Messiaen et al. 2009; Pasmant et al. 2009; Spurlock et al.
2009; Muram-Zborovski et al. 2010; Denayer et al. 2011;
Laycock-van Spyk et al. 2011; Spencer et al. 2011).

NF1, an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder
that affects approximately one in 3500 individuals, was
the first disorder found to originate from a component of
the Ras/MAPK pathway. The NF1 gene product neuro-
fibromin negatively regulates Ras signaling by functioning
as a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) to accelerate
the hydrolysis of active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP
(Martin et al. 1990; Xu et al. 1990). Loss of neurofibromin
leads to hyperactive Ras signaling, as observed by elevated
Ras pathway activity in cells (Basu et al. 1992; DeClue et al.
1992; Bollag et al. 1996). Despite the identification of
neurofibromin as a RasGAP 20 years ago, the regulation
of neurofibromin activity remains poorly understood.
Neurofibromin has been reported to be positively and
negatively regulated by various phosphorylation events,
but the context of this regulation is largely unknown (Feng
et al. 2004; Mangoura et al. 2006; Leondaritis et al. 2009). In
addition, neurofibromin protein levels are negatively regu-
lated by the ubiquitin proteasome system following growth
factor stimulation (Cichowski et al. 2003; McGillicuddy
et al. 2009). However, the exact regulatory mechanism
that couples receptor growth factor activation to neuro-
fibromin’s suppression of Ras activation remains unclear.
Here we report that Spred1 down-regulates the Ras/
MAPK pathway through an interaction with the NF1
protein neurofibromin. Importantly, this interaction func-
tions to recruit neurofibromin to the plasma membrane.
Furthermore, loss-of-function Spred1 mutants observed in
Legius syndrome are either unable to bind neurofibromin
or incapable of recruiting it to the membrane. Our data
provide evidence for a molecular link between the phe-
notypically overlapping developmental disorders Legius
syndrome and NF1.

Results and Discussion

Ectopic expression of Spred1 results in suppression of ERK
activation following acute agonist stimulation by various
growth factors, including EGF and FGF (Supplemental
Fig. S1; Wakioka et al. 2001). Spred1 has been described as
functioning both upstream of and downstream from Ras
(Wakioka et al. 2001; King et al. 2005). To address these
discrepancies, we tested the hypothesis that Spred1 acts
upstream of Ras by examining whether Spred1 could affect
cellular Ras-GTP levels following growth factor stimula-
tion (Fig. 1A). Inducible expression of Spred1 in T-REx-293
cells significantly reduced Ras-GTP levels following EGF
stimulation, suggesting that Spred1 might interfere with
Ras regulation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Spred1
suppressed downstream MAPK signaling, as evidenced by
decreases in phospho-Raf and phospho-ERK. To further
investigate the hypothesis that Spred1 affects Ras regula-
tion, we depleted Spred1 from a cancer cell line with
reportedly high Spred1 protein levels (Fig. 1B; Li et al.
2010). Depletion of Spred1 from the PC3 prostate cell line
resulted in elevated levels of Ras-GTP following EGF
stimulation. Taken together, these data support the model
that Spred1 can function upstream of Ras to negatively
regulate its activation, although we cannot exclude the
possibility that Spred1 may also independently function
downstream from Ras activation as well.

We next asked whether SPRED1 loss-of-function mu-
tations found in Legius syndrome (Supplemental Table

S1) might similarly affect Ras activity (Fig. 1C). Interest-
ingly, we found that ectopic expression of Spred1-bearing
pathogenic missense mutations in the N-terminal EVH1
domain and C-terminal SPR domain are defective in sup-
pressing Ras-GTP levels and inhibiting ERK activation
following growth factor treatment. The truncation mu-
tant M266fsX4, which retains the N-terminal EVH1 domain
but lacks the SPR and internal Kit-binding domains, was also
defective in regulating Ras-GTP and phospho-ERK levels.

The majority of reported Spred1 mutations produce a
premature stop codon, resulting in C-terminally truncated
protein products (Brems et al. 2007; Messiaen et al. 2009;
Pasmant et al. 2009; Spurlock et al. 2009; Muram-Zborovski
et al. 2010; Denayer et al. 2011; Laycock-van Spyk et al.
2011; Spencer et al. 2011). As the SPR domain has previously
been reported to target Spred1 to the plasma membrane via
interactions with phospholipids and caveolin-1 (Lim et al.
2002; Nonami et al. 2005), we surmised that the truncated
mutants were unable to function as a result of mislocaliza-
tion. To test this hypothesis, we artificially localized the
Spred1 C-terminal truncation mutant (M266fsX4) to the
membrane by fusing it to the membrane targeting CAAX
motif of Kras4B (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence microscopy
revealed that the mutant Spred1 protein localized primarily
to the cytoplasm, whereas the mutant CAAX fusion pro-
tein was localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). The
mutant CAAX protein also showed a restored ability to
reduce EGF-induced Ras activation and inhibit ERK activa-
tion (Fig. 2C), indicating that the inhibitory activity of
Spred1 resides at the N terminus. Intriguingly, this also
suggests that defective membrane targeting of Spred1 is
responsible for loss-of-function of Spred1 in Legius syn-
drome-associated C-terminal truncation mutants.

Thus far, ;12 missense mutations in SPRED1 have been
characterized as pathogenic in Legius syndrome (11 point
mutations and one four-amino-acid in-frame deletion), five of
which are used in this study (Supplemental Table S1; Brems
et al. 2007; Messiaen et al. 2009; Pasmant et al. 2009; Spurlock
et al. 2009; Denayer et al. 2011; Spencer et al. 2011). Of these
12 missense mutations, nine localize to the EVH1 domain.
When we introduced two of these mutations (T102R and
I81_V85del) into the truncated CAAX fusion protein, both
prevented the ability of the CAAX motif to rescue Spred1
function (Fig. 2C). Together, these results underscore the
importance of the EVH1 domain of Spred1 in inhibiting
ERK activation, and the importance of the SPR domain in
directing the plasma membrane localization of Spred1.

EVH1 domains are protein–protein interaction modules
that recognize and bind proline-rich sequences (Gertler et al.
1996). The crystal structure of the Xenopus tropicalis Spred1
EVH1 domain suggests a distinct peptide-binding mecha-
nism compared with other identified EVH1 domains
(Harmer et al. 2005). Although an interacting protein for
the Spred2 EVH1 domain has recently been reported (NBR1)
(Mardakheh et al. 2009), proteins that specifically interact
with the Spred1 EVH1 domain have yet to be determined.
Since the EVH1 domain appears to be essential for
Spred’s function, we hypothesized that an unidentified
binding partner of the EVH1 domain might be required
for Spred1’s inhibitory activity. To identify novel Spred1
EVH1-interacting proteins, we performed tandem affinity
purification (TAP) (Burckstummer et al. 2006) using the
truncation mutant-CAAX fusion protein (Fig. 2A) as bait.
Following mass spectrometry analysis, we identified the
NF1 gene product neurofibromin as a novel Spred1 EVH1-

domain of Spred1 prevented association
with neurofibromin, whereas constructs
encoding the wild-type EVH1 domain
either alone or fused to a CAAX motif
were able to interact with neurofibro-
min (Fig. 3A). Finally, a pathogenic point
mutation in the C-terminal SPR domain
P415A did not prevent Spred1 from bind-
ing neurofibromin. These results indi-
cated that the ability of Spred1 to
associate with neurofibromin is depen-
dent on its EVH1 domain. These data
support the model that missense EVH1
mutations are pathogenic due to loss of an
interaction with neurofibromin.

mutations into NTAP-M266fsX4-CAAX abolished its ability to rescue.

binding partner (Supplemental Fig. S2). Neurofibromin
is a tumor suppressor and a RasGAP (Martin et al. 1990;
Xu et al. 1990) that regulates Ras GTPase activity by
catalyzing the hydrolysis of active GTP-bound Ras to
inactive GDP-bound Ras. Loss of neurofibromin function
removes this regulation and leads to uncontrolled cell
growth and proliferation. The identification of this Ras-
GAP as a binding partner of Spred1 was consistent with
our biochemical results that Spred1 suppresses Ras-GTP
levels and was particularly intriguing given the overlap-
ping phenotypes observed in Legius syndrome and NF1.

To confirm this interaction, we performed coimmuno-
precipitation experiments in mammalian cells. Ectopi-
cally expressed wild-type Spred1 coprecipitated with en-
dogenous neurofibromin in human embryonic kidney
(HEK) 293T cells but not with p120 GAP, another Ras-
GAP (Fig. 3A). In a reciprocal experiment, immunopre-
cipitated endogenous neurofibromin could coprecipitate
stably expressed full length Spred1 (Fig. 3B). In order to
detect endogenous Spred1–NF1 binding, we used postnatal
day 0 (P0) mouse brain lysates for endogenous interaction
assays, since Spred1 is expressed predominantly in the
brain (Bundschu et al. 2006). Endogenous neurofibromin
could be immunoprecipitated with endogenous Spred1,
and inversely, Spred1 could be immunoprecipitated with
neurofibromin, supporting a physiologically relevant in-
teraction between Spred1 and neurofibromin (Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, we were able to detect endogenous Spred1–
NF1 binding in a high-expressing Spred1 cell line, DLD-1,
a colon cancer cell line (Supplemental Fig. S3).

We also found that the two other Spred1 family members,
Spred2 and Spred3, could associate with neurofibromin
(Fig. 3D). However, Sprouty proteins, which lack the N-
terminal EVH1 domain, did not coprecipitate neurofibro-
min. Moreover, pathogenic point mutations in the EVH1

(MEFs)

To determine whether neurofibromin
is necessary for Spred1 to inhibit Ras
activation, we depleted neurofibromin
with siRNA in T-REx-293 cells stably
expressing Spred1 (Fig. 4A). Reducing
neurofibromin expression with two dif-
ferent siRNA oligos suppressed Spred1’s
ability to reduce Ras-GTP levels and
decrease ERK phosphorylation, indicat-
ing that neurofibromin is necessary
for Spred1 function. We next examined
Spred1’s activity in NF1 /  mouse em-
bryonic fibroblasts
(Fig. 4B).
Whereas ectopic Spred1 was able to re-
duce Ras-GTP levels when introduced
into wild-type NF1+/+ MEFs, Spred1 over-
expression in NF1 /  MEFs failed to reduce Ras activity.
Taken together, these results show that neurofibromin is
necessary for Spred1’s inhibitory activity on the Ras path-
way. We next tested whether neurofibromin requires Spred
to negatively regulate Ras. In PC3 or U87 glioblastoma
cells, NF1 expression slightly dampened Ras-GTP levels in
control and Spred1 siRNA-depleted cells. However, this
effect was abrogated in cells depleted of both Spred1 and
Spred2 (Supplemental Fig S4). These results suggest that the
Spreds are necessary for neurofibromin’s inhibitory activity.
GAPs can be recruited to the plasma membrane via
adapter proteins; for example, p120 translocation to the
plasma membrane is dependent on receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) binding (Cleghon et al. 1998). Because
Spred1 has previously been reported to interact with
Ras directly (Wakioka et al. 2001), and localizing the
Spred1 EVH1 domain to the plasma membrane rescues
Spred1’s inhibitory function (Fig. 2), we reasoned that
Spred1 might recruit neurofibromin to active signaling
complexes at the plasma membrane. To test this hypoth-
esis, we monitored neurofibromin localization in the
presence or absence of Spred1 by immunofluorescence
microscopy. Expressed alone,
full-length neurofibromin
localized primarily to the cytoplasm, whereas Spred1, when
expressed alone, localized to the plasma membrane (Fig.
4C). When coexpressed, however, Spred1 and neurofibro-
min colocalized at the membrane, suggesting that Spred1
can facilitate neurofibromin translocation to the plasma
membrane. We also examined the effect of the Spred1 point
mutations on neurofibromin localization and observed that
the T102R EVH1 domain mutant was still able to localize
to the plasma membrane but failed to recruit neurofibromin
to the membrane (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the P415A Spry
domain mutant colocalized with neurofibromin at the

plemental Fig. S6). In summary, Spred’s inhibi-
tory activity on the Ras/MAPK pathway depends
on the recruitment of neurofibromin to the
plasma membrane.

This work identifies a new biochemical
link between Legius syndrome and NF1 and
provides the first evidence for the molecular
mechanism of Spred1 function, invoking a
novel and critical regulatory mechanism for
neurofibromin. On the basis of the data de-
scribed here, we propose a new model for
Spred1 inhibition of the Ras/MAPK pathway.
We show that the N-terminal EVH1 domain
of Spred1 interacts with neurofibromin and
mediates its translocation to the plasma
membrane, where neurofibromin can perform
its function as a RasGAP. This model is con-
sistent with the ability of Spred1 to reduce
cellular Ras-GTP levels in the absence of any
known enzymatic activity. Previously, Spred1
and Spred2 have been reported to translocate
to the plasma membrane following growth
factor stimulation (Wakioka et al. 2001) and
inhibit mitogenic signaling induced by a range
of growth factors and cytokines (Nonami et al.
2004; Bundschu et al. 2006); future studies
should aim to identify specific receptors that
may engage Spred1 to recruit neurofibromin
and modulate Ras-GTP signaling.

Figure 3. Neurofibromin is a novel Spred1-binding partner. (A) Flag-tagged eGFPf,
RKIP, wild-type Spred1, or the indicated Spred1 mutants were transfected into HEK-
293T cells, serum-starved for 16 h, and lysed 24 h post-transfection. Anti-Flag im-
munoprecipitates were blotted for endogenous neurofibromin and p120 GAP.

Endogenous neurofibromin was immunoprecipitated from T-REx-293 cell lysates stably
expressing TET-inducible 6X-HIS Spred1. (C) Endogenous neurofibromin coimmuno-
precipitated with endogenous Spred1 from P0 whole mouse brain lysates using an anti-
Spred1 antibody. Endogenous Spred1 also coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous
neurofibromin with two different NF1 antibodies. (D) Ectopic Spred2 and Spred3 also

cytoplasm, rather than at the plasma membrane. These
data were consistent with our observations that the T102R
mutant failed to interact with neurofibromin by coimmu-
noprecipitation, whereas the pathogenic P415A mutant
could still bind neurofibromin.

To confirm that neurofibromin recruitment was depen-
dent on the EVH1 domain, we also examined neurofibro-
min localization after coexpression of the M266fsX4-CAAX
mutant (Fig. 4C; Supplemental Fig. S5). Consistent with our
biochemical interaction data, we observed that neurofibro-
min translocated to the membrane in the presence of the
membrane targeted (CAAX) Spred1 mutant. However,
when the T102R point mutation was introduced into
the M266fsX4-CAAX construct, mutant Spred1 still local-
ized to the membrane but failed to recruit neurofibromin,
which remained cytoplasmic (Fig. 4C, bottom panel).

To biochemically confirm that Spred1 was capable of
localizing neurofibromin to the plasma membrane, Spred1-
expressing 293 cells were subjected to biochemical fraction-
ation (Fig. 4D). Endogenous neurofibromin was distributed
primarily to the cytoplasmic fraction. However, following
exogenous expression of Spred1, there was a robust change
in subcellular distribution of neurofibromin in that cyto-
plasmic neurofibromin significantly decreased and there
was a large increase in neurofibromin in the membrane
fraction. Consistent with our immunofluorescence data,
the Spred1 EVH1 T102R mutant was found in the mem-
brane fraction but did not alter neurofibromin’s cytoplas-
mic localization. The ectopic expression of Spred2 also led
to a significant redistribution of neurofibromin from the
cytoplasm to the membrane fraction (Fig. 4E).

Additionally, the siRNA knockdown of both Spred1 and
Spred2 in PC3 cells led to a significant reduction of
endogenous neurofibromin in the membrane fraction (Sup-

GENES & DEVELOPMENT

Given the overlapping clinical phenotypes
of Legius syndrome and NF1, our findings pro-
vide a molecular basis for these similarities and support
a role for Spred1 as a novel regulator of neurofibromin
function. Furthermore, since Spred2 and Spred3 can also
interact with neurofibromin, these two isoforms may
compensate for loss of Spred1 and thus may help explain
the milder phenotype associated with Legius syndrome in
comparison with NF1. Thus, these results not only iden-
tify a novel regulatory module for neurofibromin and
Ras/MAPK signaling, but importantly, also provide the
first molecular link between NF1 and Legius syndrome.

TAP and mass spectrometry (MS)

T-REx-293 cells (Invitrogen) stably expressing tetracycline-inducible
TAP-tagged wild-type Spred1 or M266fsX4-CAAX were plated in five
15-cm dishes. Twenty-four hours following induction with doxycycline
(1 mg/mL), cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL). Pooled cell
lysates were purified and analyzed as described (Burckstummer et al.
2006; Rodriguez-Viciana et al. 2006) with the following differences for
the MS analysis: Digests were analyzed using a QSTAR Elite mass
spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex). Data were searched

Following transfection, HeLa cells were grown in serum-free medium over-
night, washed with PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or stimulated
with EGF (10 ng/mL) prior to fixation. Cells were washed with PBS, followed
by extraction and blocking with PBS containing 3% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich),
0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% sodium azide (PBS-BT). Coverslips were
incubated sequentially with primary antibodies diluted in PBS-BT for 1 h at
room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Alexa Fluor dye-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Invitrogen) were diluted in PBS-BT 1:250 and incubated sequen-
tially for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted using anti-fade
mounting medium containing PBS, glycerol, and P-phenylenediamine. For
standard immunofluorescence, images for Figure 2B were acquired with a
Leica SP6; for Figure 4C and Supplemental Figure S5, images were acquired
with Openlab 4.0.4 (PerkinElmer) using an Axiovert 200M (Carl Zeiss, Inc).
Images were processed using Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc).

Biochemical fractionation

Twenty-four hours to 48 h after transfection with GFP or Spred constructs,
293T cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris at pH 7.5,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails),
incubated for 20 min on ice, and then passed through a 25-gauge needle 15
times to lyse. Lysates were replenished with NaCl to a final concentration

of 150 mM, spun at 100g for 3 min to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells, and
then spun at 10,000g for 15 min to pellet the membrane fraction. The pellet
was washed twice with lysis buffer, and membrane proteins were solubi-
lized in TNE buffer (20 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1%
Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails); the
membrane fraction was then cleared at 15,000g for 10 min. The supernatant
following the 10,000g spin was spun at 100,000g for 30 min, and the final
supernatant was isolated as the cytoplasmic fraction.
