Drosophila peripheral nerves, similar structurally to the peripheral
nerves of mammals, comprise a layer of axons and inner glia,
surrounded by an outer perineurial glial layer. Although it is well
established that intercellular communication occurs among cells
within peripheral nerves, the signaling pathways used and the
effects of this signaling on nerve structure and function remain
incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate with genetic
methods that the Drosophila peripheral nerve is a favorable system
for the study of intercellular signaling. We show that growth of the
perineurial glia is controlled by interactions among ﬁve genes: ine,
which encodes a putative neurotransmitter transporter; eag, which
encodes a potassium channel; push, which encodes a large, Zn21-
ﬁnger-containing protein; amn, which encodes a putative neu-
ropeptide related to the pituitary adenylate cyclase activator
peptide; and NF1, the Drosophila ortholog of the human gene
responsible for type 1 neuroﬁbromatosis.
In other Drosophila
systems, push and NF1 are required for signaling pathways medi-
ated by Amn or the pituitary adenylate cyclase activator peptide.
Our results support a model in which the Amn neuropeptide, acting
through Push and NF1, inhibits perineurial glial growth, whereas
the substrate neurotransmitter of Ine promotes perineurial glial
growth. Defective intercellular signaling within peripheral nerves
might underlie the formation of neuroﬁbromas, the hallmark of
neuroﬁbromatosis.

Both mammalian and invertebrate peripheral nerves comprise

a central core of motor and sensory axons surrounded by
inner glia (termed Schwann cells in mammals and peripheral glia
in Drosophila) and outer glia (termed perineurium in mammals,
and perineurial glia in Drosophila; refs. 1 and 2). In Drosophila,
the peripheral glia form the ‘‘blood–brain’’ permeability barrier
(1). The role of the perineurial glia is less clear but might serve
to provide structural support for the peripheral nerves. These
cells communicate extensively by the release of and response to
both small molecule and peptide neurotransmitters, as well as
protein factors (3). For example, acetylcholine and ATP released
by the frog motor nerve terminal in response to nerve activity
increase intracellular [Ca21]
in neighboring perisynaptic
Schwann cells (4). In addition, glutamate released from the squid
giant neuron activates Schwann cell potassium currents by means
of increased [cAMP] (5). Finally, Schwann cells release factors
such as Desert Hedge Hog that organize the surrounding
perineurium, and also release factors that regulate neuronal
survival, neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and
Schwann cell survival in the absence of neurons (6–8).

One disease in humans that might reflect impaired intercel-
lular communication within peripheral nerves is type 1 neuro-
fibromatosis, caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. This disease
is characterized by the appearance of peripheral nerve sheath
tumors called neurofibromas (reviewed in ref. 9). As is the case
with other disorders involving tumor-suppressor genes, type 1
neurofibromatosis is inherited as a dominant disorder, and it is
thought that tumors arise after spontaneous loss of the NF11

allele within certain cells during somatic growth. However,
neurofibromas exhibit properties that are not expected for those
caused by loss of a tumor suppressor. For example, neurofibro-
mas are heterogeneous and contain cells derived from each of
the cell types normally found within peripheral nerves (neurons,
Schwann cells, and perineurial cells). These cells are not clonally
related and thus it seems highly unlikely that the NF11 allele has
been lost in each cell type. Rather, it seems more likely that
phenotypically wild-type cells within these tumors overprolifer-
ate in response to factors released aberrantly from Nf12 cells.
However, this possibility remains speculative and no detailed
mechanism for the aberrant release of a diffusible factor has
been proposed.

Here we report a genetic dissection of signaling pathways
controlling the structure of the Drosophila peripheral nerve. We
show that mutations in five distinct genes, in either single or
particular double-mutant combination, increase the growth of
the perineurial glial layer of the larval peripheral nerve. Two of
these genes, amnesiac (amn) and inebriated (ine), are each likely
to control neurotransmitter-mediated signaling pathways. amn
encodes a putative neuropeptide related to the pituitary ade-
nylate cyclase activator peptide (PACAP; ref. 10), whereas ine
encodes a putative Na1yCl2-dependent neurotransmitter trans-
porter and is likely to be required for reuptake of a substrate
neurotransmitter (11–13). These observations suggest that per-
ineurial glial growth is controlled by two distinct neurotrans-
mitters. Two additional genes, pushover (push) and NF1 (the
Drosophila ortholog of the human NF1 gene), have each been
implicated in other systems as downstream targets of Amn or
PACAP (refs. 14–16; S. Hawley, personal communication).
These observations suggest that push and NF1 might mediate the
effects of Amn on perineurial glial growth. The fifth gene, eag,
encodes a potassium channel that affects motor neuron excit-
ability (17), suggesting a role for neuronal excitability in the
control of perineurial glial growth. We also report the sequence
of push, which encodes an extremely large membrane protein

lution. We propose a model for the control of perineurial glial
growth by two interacting neurotransmitter-mediated signaling
pathways. Furthermore, we suggest that neurofibromas, the
hallmark of neurofibromatosis, might result from defective
receipt of neurotransmitter signals within peripheral nerves.

Materials and Methods
Electron Microscopy. Tissue sections were prepared as described
(2). Because push mutations confer male sterility,
it is not
possible to construct a homozygous push mutant stock. Thus, to
identify homozygous larvae, a stock was constructed in which the
push, eag; push and ine push chromosomes were crossed into a
yellow (y) background and placed in combination with the second
chromosome balancer, CyO, that carried a P[y1] transgene.
Homozygous larvae from these stocks were identified by yellow
mouth hooks before dissection for electron microscopy. Wan-
dering third instar larvae were grown at room temperature from
uncrowded half-pint bottles and collected 1 or 2 days after the
first wandering larvae appeared. For experiments involving heat
shock, larvae were heat-shocked daily for 1 hour at 37°C. Larvae
were dissected, fixed with glutaraldehyde and paraformalde-
hyde, stained with both 0.5% OsO4 and 2% uranyl acetate, and
embedded in an eponate 12-araldite mixture. Ultrathin cross-
sectional slices (pale gold, 75–125-nm-thick) were captured,
poststained by using uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate,
and analyzed by using a JEOL or Hitachi (Tokyo) transmission
electron microscope at either 60 or 80 kV. The thickness of the
perineurial glial cell layer for a given nerve was determined by
averaging the distance from the edge of the nerve to the
boundary of the axon-containing lumen at 8 different positions:
12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock and four additional measurements at points
in between these positions. Measurements were not taken at
positions where a perineurial glial cell nucleus was encountered.
All statistical analyses were carried out by using STATVIEW v4.51
(Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA).

Cloning and Sequence Analysis of push. DNA flanking push3420, a P
element insertion that causes a hypomorphic push mutation (14,
18), was isolated by using a plasmid-rescue technique by trans-
forming a dilute ligation of NheI-digested push3420 genomic
DNA. The subcloned push3420 flanking DNA was used as a probe
to screen both a lambda Drosophila genomic DNA library and a
Drosophila testes cDNA library kindly donated by T. Hazelrigg
(Columbia Univ., New York). Both of these libraries were
screened according to protocols from Stratagene. A number of
cDNA and genomic clones were isolated in the process of
walking the entire gene. In addition, use was made of P1 clone
DS002276 from the Berkeley Drosophila genome project, which
contains the complete push gene. For sequencing, double-
stranded DNA was prepared by using Qiagen (Hilden, Ger-
many) plasmid purification kits, sequence reactions were
performed by using the dye terminator chemistry from Perkin–
Elmer Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), and were run on
an automated DNA sequencer from the same company. Se-
quences were assembled by using SEQUENCHER software (Gene
Codes, Ann Arbor, MI), and the completed cDNA was concep-
tually translated by using GCG software.

Results
Control of Perineurial Glial Growth by Interacting Pathways. Muta-
tions in two genes that affect neuronal excitability also affect the
structure of the peripheral nerve: double mutants defective in
inebriated (ine), which encodes a member of the Na1yCl2-
dependent neurotransmitter transporter family (11–13), and
pushover (push) exhibit an extremely thickened nerve, which is a
phenotype that is clearly visible with the dissecting microscope.
To understand the cellular basis for this phenotype, we per-

formed transmission electron microscopy on cross-sections of
peripheral nerves. This analysis demonstrated that the push1 and
ine1 push1 double mutants exhibited a normal axon and periph-
eral glial layer, but a thickened perineurial glial layer. This
increased perineurial thickness was expressed only moderately in
push1 but very strongly in the ine1 push1 double mutant (Fig. 1
and Fig. 5, which is published as supplemental data on the PNAS
web site, www.pnas.org). This increase in thickness was accom-
panied by an increase in the number of mitochondria within
perineurial glial thin sections (130 6 19 in ine1 push1 vs. 30 6 7
in wild type; P 5 0.0001), suggesting that an increase in cell
material accompanies this increased thickness. The ine1 push1
phenotype was significantly rescued in transgenic larvae express-
ing the 943-aa Ine isoform called Ine-P1 under the transcrip-
tional control of the heat-shock promoter (13). In particular,
perineurial glial thickness in ine1 push1; hs-ine-P1 larvae, even in
the absence of heat shock, was reduced to 2.0 6 0.2 mm (n 5 11)
from 3.1 6 0.3 in ine1 push1 (n 5 14, P value vs. ine1 push1;
hs-ine-P1 5 0.008). The observed synergistic interaction between
ine and push mutations suggests that each gene controls peri-
neurial glial growth through partially redundant pathways.

In certain respects, mutations in ine confer phenotypes similar
to mutations in the K1 channel structural gene eag. In particular,
both eag and ine mutations interact synergistically with muta-
tions in the K1 channel encoded by Shaker to cause a charac-
teristic ‘‘indented thorax and down-turned wings’’ phenotype,
which is not exhibited by any of the single mutants (19). Because
of this phenotypic similarity, we tested the possibility that eag
mutations might also affect perineurial glial thickness. We found
that eag1 resembles ine1 in the control of perineurial glial growth:
eag1; push1 double mutants, but not the eag1 single mutant,

exhibited strongly potentiated perineurial glial growth. This
increased growth was similar to, but less extreme than, what was
observed in ine1 push1 (Figs. 1 and 5). eag1; push2 double mutants
also exhibited a thickened perineurial glial layer (1.88 6 0.15 mm,
n 5 14, P value vs. eag1 and push1 mutants 5 0.04). In contrast,
eag and ine mutations fail to display a comparable synergistic
interaction: perineurial glial thickness in the eag1; ine1 double
mutant was 1.43 6 0.08 mm, which is not significantly different
from the values of the eag1 or ine1 single mutants (P 5 0.8 and
0.06, respectively).

Cloning and Sequence Analysis of push. It was previously shown that
a P element insertion termed push3420 caused a partial loss of
function in push (14, 18). We used this P element as a starting point
for the isolation of push DNA. We found that the P element lies
between two ORFs, a centromere-proximal ORF called Trfp,
and a novel centromere-distal ORF (20). To determine which ORF
corresponded to push, we sequenced each ORF in the ethyl
methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced push1 and push2 mutants and in
the isogenic wild-type strain. The Trfp gene exhibited no sequence
alterations in either push mutant. However, both push mutations
were found in the novel ORF, and thus we assign this ORF as push;
push1 and push2 mutations are both nonsense mutations (at codons
728 and 883 for push1 and push2, respectively). A putative TATA
box is observed 260 bp upstream of the push3420 insertion site. Thus,
it is possible that our most 59 cDNA is incomplete at the 59 end, and
the push3420 P element is inserted in the 59 untranslated region
(UTR) of the push transcript. We found that push encodes an
enormous 5,322-aa protein containing two potential Zn21 binding
domains and 12 potential transmembrane domains (Fig. 2).

Push has many additional functions in Drosophila in addition

to controlling neuronal excitability and perineurial glial growth.
First, mutations in push cause male sterility (14). A P element
insertion called purity of essence (poe), which also causes male
sterility by means of the inhibition of sperm individuation, is
found at the identical location to push3420, raising the possibility
that push and poe are identical genes (21, 22). We found that push
is transcribed in adult testes as well as the embryonic central
nervous system (data not shown), which is consistent with this
possibility. We confirmed this possibility by demonstrating that
push and poe mutations fail to complement for the male sterility
phenotype (data not shown). Second, push might have a role in
eye development or function: an incomplete cDNA of push,
encoding 4,100 amino acids and truncated at the N terminus, was
identified previously under the name ‘‘Calossin.’’ This protein
was identified on the basis of calmodulin binding and expression
in the photoreceptor (23). Finally, genes similar to push are
present in several multicellular organisms including Caenorhab-
ditis elegans (GenBank accession no. AF003140), Arabidopsis,
and humans (GenBank accession no. AB007931). However, the
sequence of push provides few additional clues as to its function.
Mutations in push were identified independently on the basis
of defective segregation of nonrecombinant chromosomes in the
female meiosis (24). push was implicated in this process as an
intermediate in a signaling pathway mediated by the PACAP-
like neuropeptide encoded by amn (S. Hawley, personal com-
munication). This observation raised the possibility that push
likewise affects perineurial glial growth by acting as an inter-
mediate from an Amn signal. Consistent with this hypothesis, we
found that the amnX8 deletion mutation (25) increased peri-
neurial glial thickness, and that this increase was significantly
rescued in transgenic flies expressing amn1 (Fig. 3 and Fig. 6,
which is published as supplemental data on the PNAS web site).
A second signaling pathway mediated by a PACAP-like
neuropeptide was previously identified in Drosophila. In this
pathway, the larval muscle responds to application of PACAP by
activating a voltage-gated potassium channel (26). This activa-
tion requires NF1, the ortholog of the human gene responsible
for type 1 neurofibromatosis (16). We tested the possibility that
NF1 might affect perineurial glial growth. We found that the
NF1P2-null mutant (15) exhibited strong potentiation of peri-
neurial glial thickness in combination with ine1. This thickness
was much greater than the thickness observed in ine1 mutants
carrying K33, the NF11 parent chromosome of NF1P2. The
increased glial thickness of ine1; NF1P2 was fully rescued by
heat-shock-induced expression of the NF11 transgene (Figs. 3
and 6). However, unlike push, the phenotype of NF1P2 was
potentiated only moderately by the eag1 mutation (not shown).
In contrast, perineurial glial thickness in the push1; NF1P2 double
mutant was 2.1 6 0.15 mm, which is significantly thicker than
either push1 or NF1P2 (P 5 0.002 and 0.0005, respectively), but
not significantly different from amnX8 (P 5 0.33). These results
are consistent with the possibility that push and NF1 mediate the
amn signal through parallel partially redundant pathways.

Discussion
We have shown that mutations in five genes,
in single- or
double-mutant combination, increase growth of the perineurial
glial layer of the Drosophila larval peripheral nerve. Our results
are consistent with a model in which two neurotransmitter-
mediated signaling pathways exert opposing effects on perineur-
ial glial growth. One pathway, mediated by the Amn neuropep-
tide, inhibits perineurial glial growth. This pathway requires NF1
and Push activity. The second pathway, mediated by the sub-
strate neurotransmitter of Ine (which we will call NT), promotes
perineurial glial growth. In this pathway, mutations in ine or eag
each increase signaling by NT:
ine mutations increase NT
signaling by eliminating the NT reuptake transporter thus in-
creasing NT persistence, whereas eag mutations increase NT

Control of perineurial glial growth by amn and NF1. For both
heat-shock control and heat-shock rescue experiments, lines were heat
shocked daily for 1 hour at 37°C throughout development. We found that this
heat-shocking protocol had no signiﬁcant effect on perineurial glial thickness
in either amnX8 or ine1: NF1P2 lacking the appropriate rescue construct.
Perineurial glial thickness of amnX8 in the presence of heat shock was 1.82 6
0.15 (n 5 16) and in the absence of heat shock was 1.80 6 0.07, n 5 24.
Perineurial glial thickness of ine1; NF1P2 in the presence of heat shock was
2.27 6 0.17, n 5 15, and in the absence of heat shock was 2.38 6 0.22 (n 5 12).

Fig. 4.
Two models for the control of perineurial glial growth by neurotransmitters. (A) Direct signaling. The peripheral glia release both Amn and the substrate
NT. The Amn neuropeptide inhibits perineurial glial growth via Push and NF1, whereas NT promotes perineurial glial growth. The Ine transporter attenuates
the effects of this NT by reuptake. The Eag potassium channel, acting in peripheral glia, inhibits NT release by reducing excitability. (B) Indirect signaling. The
peripheral glia release a trophic factor that causes increased cell growth among the perineurial glia. Release of this trophic factor is regulated by Amn and NT,
each released from neurons, with opposing effects. Amn, acting through Push and Nf1, inhibits release of the trophic factor, whereas NT promotes release of
the trophic factor. The placement of Push downstream of Amn is most consistent with previous studies (S. Hawley, personal communication), but we cannot rule
out the possibility that Push acts in motor neurons, and its effect on perineurial glial growth results from increased release of NT or a distinct neurotransmitter.
As above, Ine and Eag attenuate the effects of NT by performing reuptake and reducing release, respectively.

signaling by increasing NT release as a consequence of increased
excitability. These pathways interact such that the most extreme
effects on perineurial glial growth are observed when the NT
pathway is overstimulated and the Amn pathway is disrupted
simultaneously. The genetic interactions that form the basis for
this interpretation require that the mutations under investigation
be null. Although the eag1 mutation tested has not been char-
acterized molecularly, the mutations in each of the other four
genes that we analyzed are known to be or are strongly suspected
to be null (11, 15, 25, this study). Direct neuron–perineurial glia
signaling is unlikely because the peripheral glia, which form the
blood–brain barrier, are expected to be an impervious barrier to
intercellular traffic. Two alternative mechanisms could underlie
this signaling. In the first mechanism (direct peripheral glia–
perineurial glia signaling; Fig. 4A), the peripheral glia release
each neurotransmitter, and the perineurial glia respond. In the
second mechanism (indirect signaling; Fig. 4B), each neurotrans-
mitter is released by neurons, and the peripheral glia respond by
regulating the release of a trophic factor that acts on perineurial
glia.

Although direct signaling seems to be the simplest possibility,
indirect signaling is most consistent with previous studies. As
described above, both invertebrate and mammalian motor neu-
rons can release small molecule and peptide neurotransmitters
that affect properties of Schwann cells. A similar motor nerve
terminal-peripheral glia communication could occur in Drosoph-
ila, because first boutons at the larval neuromuscular junction
are covered by peripheral glia (27). This observation raises the
possibility that Drosophila peripheral glia might respond to Amn
and NT released from motor nerve terminals, and propagate
these signals along the length of the nerve via gap junctions.
However, the alternative possibility of NT release from along the
length of axons, as has been suggested in other systems (28, 29),
cannot be ruled out. In addition, mammalian Schwann cells
release trophic factors such as Desert Hedge Hog (Dhh) to
induce growth of the surrounding perineurium (6), and astro-
cytes can respond to glutamate application by releasing a
substance that affects blood vessels (30). Our model predicts that

peripheral glia release a trophic factor that behaves similarly to
Dhh. The prediction that Drosophila NF1 acts within peripheral
glia is consistent with the likelihood that mammalian NF1 acts
within Schwann cells as well (31, 32).

The possible effects of the thickened perineurial glia on motor
neuron function are unclear. Mutations in four of the genes that
affect perineurial glial thickness (eag, NF1, ine, and push) were
each shown in previous studies to increase either neuronal or
muscle membrane excitability (12–14, 16, 17, 19), which raises
the possibility of a correlation between excitability and peri-
neurial glial growth. However, we have been unable to detect any
increases in neuronal excitability in the amn mutant or the ine;
NF1 double mutant (greater than that conferred by the ine
mutation alone), despite the presence of greatly thickened
perineurial glia in these genotypes (data not shown). It is possible
that the effects on neuronal excitability of these genotypes might
be subtler than our assays can detect, or that the participation of
these genes in both perineurial glial growth and excitability is
coincidental.
Our results are consistent with the previous observations that
push and NF1 act downstream of the AmnyPACAP receptor
(ref. 16; S. Hawley, personal communication). However, the
precise nature of the interactions among these proteins is
unknown. Thus, it is possible that the interactions are direct, and
that Push, the NF1-encoded protein Neurofibromin, and the
Amn receptor bind to each other in a macromolecular complex.
Alternatively, it is possible that Push and Neurofibromin medi-
ate the effects of Amn only indirectly. In either case, the
observation that the push1; NF1P2 double mutant exhibits a
perineurial glial thickness much greater than push1 or NF1P2
alone is consistent with the possibility that Push and Neurofi-
bromin mediate the Amn signal through parallel partially re-
dundant pathways (Fig. 4).

The indirect signaling model described in Fig. 4B could explain
the partial cell-nonautonomy of NF1 in neurofibroma formation.
Neurofibromas most likely initiate in individuals heterozygous
for NF1 mutations by loss of the NF11 allele in Schwann cells.
However, neurofibromas contain, in addition to Schwann cells,

cells derived from fibroblasts, perineurial cells, and neurons,
which are thought to remain phenotypically NF11. We suggest
that NF1 mutant Schwann cells cause the overproliferation of
their wild-type neighbors by oversecreting trophic factors, and
that this oversecretion might ultimately occur as a consequence
of defective receipt of a neurotransmitter signal from neurons.

Note Added in Proof. Phenotypes of mutants defective in BIG, the
Arabidopsis ortholog of push, were recently reported (35).
