Abstract
Objective—To analyse the distributions of
and generate growth charts for stature
and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC)
in neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1) patients.
Design—Cross sectional database survey.
Setting—The National Neuroﬁbromatosis
Foundation
Database
(NFDB) includes clinical information on
NF1 patients from 14 participating centres
in North America.
Subjects—A total of 569 white, North
American, NF1 patients, 55% female and
45% male.
Main outcome measures—Stature and
OFC measurements of NF1 patients were
compared to age and sex matched popula-
tion norms using z score standardisation
and centile curves.
Results—The distributions of stature and
OFC are shifted and unimodal among
NF1 patients; 13% of patients have short
stature (>2 standard deviations below the
population mean) and 24% have macro-
cephaly (OFC >2 standard deviations
above the population mean).
Conclusions—Alterations of stature and
OFC are not limited to NF1 patients with
frank short stature or macrocephaly.

Keywords: neuroﬁbromatosis 1; stature; occipitofrontal

Neuroﬁbromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal
dominant disorder aVecting about 1 in 3000
people.1–3 Its most frequent features are café au
lait macules, iris Lisch nodules, and discrete
and plexiform neuroﬁbromas. Short stature
(>2 SD below the population mean) and mac-
rocephaly (>2 SD above the population mean)
are more common in people aVected with NF1
than in the general population.4–7

NF1 features such as scoliosis and early or
delayed puberty occasionally inﬂuence stature.
However, short stature associated with NF1
usually aVects the whole skeleton proportion-
ately, and no speciﬁc cause is apparent in most

cases.5 8 Disease features such as hydrocephalus
and plexiform neuroﬁbromas occasionally aVect
measurements of occipitofrontal circumference
(OFC). However, increased OFC among NF1
patients usually has no obvious cause and
appears to result from overgrowth of the brain.5 8
It has been suggested that short stature and
macrocephaly are “all or none” phenomena that
aVect only a subset of NF1 patients.5 According
to this hypothesis, NF1 patients would be
expected to fall into two distinct groups: (1)
those whose stature is in the same normal distri-
bution as unaVected people of the same age, and
(2) those whose stature is decreased. NF1
patients would also be expected to fall into two
distinct groups with respect to macrocephaly:
(1) those whose OFC is in the same normal dis-
tribution as unaVected people of the same age,
and (2) those whose OFC is increased. We
examined the distributions of these measure-
ments to determine whether changes in growth
aVect all or only a subset of patients with NF1.
We also generated centile curves for stature and
OFC by age and gender.

Subjects and methods
SUBJECTS
All patients included in this study meet the
NIH Diagnostic Criteria for NF1.9 10 Measure-
ments of patient
stature and OFC were
obtained from the National Neuroﬁbromatosis
Foundation International Database (NFDB).11
At the time of this analysis, the NFDB included
extensive demographic and cross sectional
clinical and anthropometric data on 569 North
American, white, NF1 patients examined dur-
ing 1980-1998 at 14 participating centres in
North America. Information was collected and
recorded on each patient using a standard pro-
cedure. Patient stature was measured without
shoes using a stadiometer. OFC was measured
at the largest diameter over the occiput and
forehead using an inextensible tape line meas-
ure. The data were subjected to automated
range checking and routinely screened for
quality and consistency by the database
administrator. Only measurements from each
patient’s ﬁrst visit to a participating clinic were

included in the analysis. Patients who were
known to have one or more of the following
features on any clinical visit were excluded
from analyses of stature: pseudarthrosis (n=22,
3%), early (under 10 years) (n=13, 2%) or
delayed (over 15 years) (n=51, 1%) puberty,
optic glioma (n=66, 9%), scoliosis (n=98,
14%), or vertebral dysplasia (n=19, 3%). The
ﬁnal sample for analyses of stature consisted of
183 males and 202 females. Patients with one
or more of the following features were excluded
from analyses of OFC: plexiform neuroﬁbroma
of the head (n=46, 6%), early or delayed
puberty, optic glioma, or hydrocephalus (n=23,
3%). The ultimate sample for analyses of OFC
consisted of 216 males and 220 females.

REFERENCE POPULATIONS
Standard population norms for stature by age
were obtained from the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) studies during 1963-
1974.12 The NCHS standards are based on a
sample consisting of 83% percent white or
Hispanic subjects and 17% percent black sub-
jects living in the United States. Standard
population norms for OFC by age were
obtained from the Fels Institute study con-
ducted during 1929-1975.12 The Fels Institute
sample is slightly less heterogeneous than the
NCHS sample.

DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
Stature and OFC measurements were stand-
ardised using z scores to control for both age
and gender:

to the corresponding centiles from reference
populations. NF1 patients were divided into
sex and age groups matching those of the
curves available for population norms. A
typical series of age groups had medians of 2,
2.5, 3 . . .18 years. Age group limits were deter-
mined by splitting the diVerence between a
given median and the next lowest and highest
medians. Patients with ages equidistant from
two medians were assigned to the older age
group. For example, the 2.5 year old group
included patients aged 2.250 to 2.749 years
old. The 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th
centiles for stature and OFC were determined
for each sex in each age group of NF1 patients
and plotted alongside the centiles from the
corresponding population standards. The data
were plotted and smoothed using SAS.16
Smoothing was done by producing a cubic
spline that minimises a linear combination of
the sum of squares of the residuals of ﬁt and the
integral of the square of the second deriva-
tive.16 18 Smoothed curves were inspected to
ensure that the ﬁnal results reasonably repre-
sent the data. Splining was used and described
in detail by Hamill et al12 to generate standard
curves for the NCHS.

Results
A total of 183 males and 202 females were
included in analyses of stature and 216 males
and 220 females were included in analyses of
OFC. Analysis of variance for heterogeneity
among the 14 North American contributing
centres showed no centre bias for age and sex

Patients with stature and OFC measure-
ments corresponding to a z score with an abso-
lute value greater than 7 were excluded to
minimise data entry errors. Four (1%) stature
and two (0.5%) OFC measurements corre-
sponded to z scores below −7. One (0.3%)
stature and two (0.5%) OFC measurements
corresponded to z scores above 7. Single data
entry, as used in this study, has an error rate
around 2%.13–15 After these exclusions, we
expect
the remaining
that about 1% of
measurements contain errors.

We tested the standardised data by analysis
of variance to determine if signiﬁcant diVer-
ences exist among the measurements made by
the major contributing centres.

Distributions of z scores for stature and OFC
were plotted in histograms using SAS.16 Each
histogram is based on the z scores compiled
from males and females of all ages. In addition,
the deviation from unimodality of each distri-
bution was quantiﬁed by computing its dip sta-
tistic.17 Dip approaches zero for unimodal dis-
tributions. The signiﬁcance of a given dip value
is determined by comparing it to the distribu-
tion of values
from a known unimodal
distribution.

or OFC

Figs 1 and 2 show the distributions of stand-
ardised measurements of stature and OFC
among NF1 patients and population norms.
Mean standardised stature among NF1 pa-
tients is lower than the mean in the reference
population. Thirteen percent of
the NF1
patients lie 2 SD or more below the reference
population mean, compared to 2% of norms.
Mean standardised OFC among NF1 patients
is greater than the mean in the reference popu-
lation. Twenty four percent of NF1 patients lie
2 SD or more above the reference population
mean.

The histograms for stature and OFC appear
unimodal (ﬁgs 1 and 2); their dip statistics,
which measure departures from unimodality,
are 0.014 and 0.012,
respectively. These
correspond to the 5th centiles of departures
from known unimodal distributions. In other
words, the deviations are either within the nor-
mal range for known unimodal distributions or
lower. The standardised stature distribution
has a skewness of 0.32 and a kurtosis of 0.19;
most of the cases are clustered to the left of the
mean and the distribution peaks more abruptly
than a normal distribution. The standardised
OFC distribution has a skewness of −0.16 and
a kurtosis of 0.87; most of the cases are to the

more abruptly than normal.

Stature and OFC centiles by age are shown
in ﬁgs 3 and 4. Median stature is as much as 7
cm lower and OFC 2 cm greater in our NF1
patients than in the standard paediatric growth
charts, depending on age and gender.

Discussion
The NCHS and Fels standards were used for
comparison to stature and OFC of NF1
patients because these studies cover a wide
range of ages and are commonly used clinically
to diagnose short stature and macrocephaly.
These normal population studies were longitu-
dinal and therefore more accurately represent
growth than the cross sectional studies we
used. More recent NCHS standards for boys
and girls are available for stature, but not for
occipitofrontal
(http://
www.cdc.gov/growthcharts). These new stat-
ure standards for boys and girls are remarkably
similar to the ones we used.12 19

Standardisation for age and sex by z scores is
a transformation that allows pooling of meas-
urements across groups that diVer in age and
sex. This transformation can be applied to
measurements for which standard population
distributions are approximately normal. The
distributions of stature and OFC satisfy this
criterion.12 Thus, a subject’s z score closely
corresponds to his or her centile rank.

We were concerned that diVerences between
centres would increase the variability of our
sample and diminish our ability to analyse the
standardised distributions. However, analysis
of variance detected no diVerences for stature
or OFC among the contributing centres.

The shifts in the standardised distributions
of stature and OFC (ﬁgs 1 and 2) conﬁrm that,

on average, our NF1 patients are shorter and
have bigger heads than standard populations.
The shifts are very similar to those in a recent
longitudinal study by Carmi et al.20 The popu-
lation norms were not taken during the same
years as our sample, and some were taken 20 or
more years earlier. Secular trends suggest that
stature and OFC may have increased in the
normal population over this time.16 21–23 If year
speciﬁc standards were used in our study and
the one by Carmi et al,20 the shift in stature may
be slightly larger than indicated here and the
shift in OFC may be slightly smaller. Ascertain-
ment bias may also aVect the distribution
shifts. Although short stature and macro-
cephaly are not among the diagnostic criteria

www.jmedgenet.com

for NF1, these features may have contributed
to the patients’ referral to the contributing NF
clinics.9 Therefore, the group in this study may
be shorter and have bigger heads than a popu-
lation based sample of children with NF1.

The distributions of standardised stature
and OFC are more abruptly peaked than a
normal distribution, indicating a relative excess
of cases around the mean and in the tails. This
variability could result from several factors. (1)
The NFDB patient measurements are cross
sectional and, therefore, more variable than
longitudinal data. (2) Our patient group is geo-
graphically heterogeneous. (3) A small pro-
portion of cases may have data entry errors. (4)
Ascertainment bias may increase the frequency
of outliers. (5) Such distributions might repre-
sent composites of more than one normally
distributed group with the same mean but dif-
ferent variances.24

Riccardi5 has suggested that short stature
and macrocephaly in NF1 are “all or none”
phenomena, that is, that two diVerent groups of
NF1 patients exist, those with short stature (or
macrocephaly) and those without. Under this
hypothesis, the distributions should be bimo-
dal, with one mode more than 2 SD outside the
normal mean. Our ﬁndings are not consistent
with this suggestion. The distributions (ﬁgs 1
and 2) indicate that stature is reduced to some
degree and OFC enlarged to some extent in all
NF1 patients.

Our centile curves for stature and OFC (ﬁgs
3 and 4) are comparable to those from a recent
study of Italian NF1 patients.25 Minor diVer-
ences may be partly because of line smoothing
techniques and geographical variation. Devia-
tion from these NF1 standards may indicate
the eVect of a speciﬁc disease feature such as
optic glioma or hydrocephalus. NF1 speciﬁc
charts may also provide reassurance that an
aVected child’s growth, although outside the
“normal” range on standard paediatric growth
charts, is actually normal for a child with NF1.

Patients with hydrocephalus and plexiform
neuroﬁbromas of the head were excluded from
analyses of OFC, so enlargement of the head in
the remaining patients must be the result of
enlargement of the scalp, skull, or brain. In
NF1, enlargement of the brain is the probable
cause.5 8 Glial cell proliferation is increased in
vitro by sera from NF1 patients, compared to
sera from unaVected subjects.26 Optic or other
CNS gliomas are another manifestation of glial
cell proliferation. They were observed by MRI
in 10% of people in the NFDB aVected with
NF1. Other
studies have observed optic
gliomas in 1.5% of 135 and 15% of 217 NF1
patients.27 28 Glial overgrowth is an important
part of NF1 and it may be responsible for mac-
rocephaly in NF1 patients.

Patients with puberty disturbance or bone
abnormalities were excluded from analyses of
stature. The cause of the stature reduction in
the remaining NF1 patients is unknown, but it
appears to aVect the skeleton proportionately.5

Growth in NF1

937

for either of

Data reviewed by Howell et al29 indicate that
growth hormone replacement therapy resulted
in a moderate increase in stature for NF1
patients with biochemical evidence of growth
hormone deﬁciency. However, growth hor-
mone deﬁciency was found in only three
(2.5%) of 122 children with NF1 in another
study.30 Short
stature occurs much more
frequently (13%) in the NFDB than can be
attributed to such deﬁciency. Although growth
hormone levels were not measured routinely in
the NFDB patients, less than 1% are known to
have ever had documented growth hormone
deﬁciency.
The ﬁndings in this study are consistent with
known molecular function of the NF1 gene/
protein. The NF1 protein, neuroﬁbromin, is
involved in control of cellular growth and
diVerentiation through the interaction of its
GAP related domain with p21ras and tubulin.31
Neuroﬁbromin is expressed in many diVerent
tissues, including the brain, and mutations in
the GAP related domain produce hyperactivity
of p21ras, which leads to aberrant signalling for
cell proliferation.32 This may contribute to
increased glial (astrocyte) cell proliferation and
to enlargement of the brain in NF1 patients.32 33
The NF1 homologue in Drosophila acts as an
activator of the cAMP pathway as well as a
negative regulator of Ras.34 Drosophila homo-
zygous
two particular NF1
mutants that lack expression of NF1 protein
are 20 to 25% smaller than ﬂies of the parental
strain.35 This growth defect was rescued not
only by an NF1 transgene but also by
expression of activated protein kinase A,
suggesting protein kinase A functions down-
stream of or parallel to neuroﬁbromin. Deﬁ-
ciencies in this pathway may contribute to a
smaller phenotype in humans as well. Activated
protein kinase A is known to stimulate
proliferation in some cell
types and may
normally contribute to body growth.36 37 Nor-
mal
the protein kinase A
pathway also accelerates diVerentiation and
inhibits proliferation of glial (oligodendrocyte)
cells.38 39 Neuroﬁbromin involvement
in or
between the protein kinase A and p21ras path-
ways may contribute to the larger heads
observed in people diagnosed with NF1.40
However, our patients with the smallest stature
did not also have the largest heads (results not
shown).
Short stature and macrocephaly are well recog-
nised clinical
features of NF1. This study
suggests that these changes in growth aVect all
NF1 patients and are not limited to particular
subgroups. The mechanisms by which muta-
tions of the NF1 gene produce these pheno-
typic eVects are unknown, but understanding
how they do so may provide an important clue
to the pathogenesis of more serious manifesta-
tions of NF1.
