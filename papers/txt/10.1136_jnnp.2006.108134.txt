Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a single gene disorder associated with a high frequency of
cognitive deficits and a complex cognitive phenotype. These cognitive deficits have been associated with focal
areas of high signal intensity on T2 weighted MRI images but the relationship remains controversial.
Method: A cohort of 76 children with NF1 and 45 unaffected sibling controls (aged 8–16 years) underwent
extensive neuropsychological assessment, with the NF1 children having MRI examinations.
Results: The presence or number of T2 hyperintensities (T2H) was not associated with cognitive dysfunction.
However, the location of discrete (well circumscribed) T2H in the thalamus was associated with severe and
generalised cognitive impairment. More diffuse lesions in the thalamus were also associated with reductions
in IQ but the effects were less marked compared with the discrete lesions. Comparing children with NF1 to
their unaffected siblings revealed more subtle effects of the lesions on cognitive ability.
Conclusions: T2H cannot be used in general as a radiological marker for cognitive deficits in children with
NF1; however, lesions in the thalamus are strongly associated with cognitive impairment. It is possible that
lesions in the thalamus in conjunction with more general thalamic hypometabolism may compound the level of
thalamic dysfunction, resulting in cognitive deficits well beyond those produced by T2H in other regions.

N eurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous

disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 3500.1
One of the most common complications of NF1 in
childhood is cognitive dysfunction. The most frequent problems
reported are with attention, perception, executive functioning
and academic achievement.2 NF1 is also associated with an
increased risk for many CNS abnormalities, the most common
being T2 hyperintensities (T2H), present in 60–70% of children
with NF1.3 These lesions are usually isointense on T1 weighted
images, exert no mass effect, do not enhance with contrast, are
not associated with focal neurological deficits and tend to
resolve by adulthood.4 They most commonly occur in the basal
ganglia, brainstem, thalamus, optic tracts and cerebellum.

The potential relationship between these MRI T2H and
cognitive dysfunction in NF1 remains controversial. While
some studies have found no association between T2H and
cognitive ability,5–9 several recent studies have found a relation-
ship between cognitive dysfunction and the presence,10–12
number13 and location of T2H.14 15 The interpretation of results
from many studies is hampered by small sample size, wide age
range (ie, inclusion of adult patients in whom T2H may have
resolved), variability in the definition of cognitive deficits and
T2H, and the inclusion of patients with other intracranial
pathology that may influence the presence of T2H and cognitive
performance. On this basis we aimed to determine whether the
presence, number and/or location of T2H are predictive of either
general intellectual functioning or specific cognitive/learning
deficits in a larger cohort of NF1 children (without any other
significant cranial pathology).

METHOD
Subjects
All patients were recruited from the Neurogenetics Clinic at the
Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children (Children’s Hospital at
Westmead) in Sydney, Australia. This study was conducted as
part of a larger study examining the cognitive profile of children
with NF1, where recruitment is described in detail.2 Exclusion
criteria included CNS pathology or other medical conditions

that affected test performance (eg, epilepsy/seizures, optic
gliomas, brain tumours, hydrocephalus). Of
the 81 NF1
patients in the larger study, 76 agreed to undergo a cranial
MRI. Of these 76 NF1 patients, 45 unaffected sibling controls
were also recruited and underwent neuropsychological assess-
ment. The number of recruited patients was based on the
maximum number of patients that we were able to ascertain
from our clinic. This study received ethics approval from both
the Children’s Hospital at Westmead Ethics Committee and the
US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.

Procedure
Neuropsychological testing was conducted individually over
two morning sessions, and an MRI was scheduled immediately
following one of
these sessions. Parents of children on
stimulant medication for attention deficit–hyperactivity dis-
order (ADHD) were requested not to give their children the
medication on the days of testing (n = 5). The MRI examina-
tions were performed on a magnet operating at 1.5 T (Philips
ACS-NT; Philips, the Netherlands). The scans assessed via
visual inspection on a light box MRI sequences were sagittal T1,
axial T2, axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR),
volume T2 (T2V), coronal FLAIR and axial T1 weighted imaging
following intravenous administration of gadopentate dimeglu-
mine at 0.1 mmol/kg (Magnevist). Typical imaging parameters
were TR 500/TE 15 for axial T1 images pre and post contrast, TR
3600/TE 120 for single contrast axial T2 sequences and TR 7000/
TE 130 IR delay 2200 ms for axial FLAIR. T2V parameters were
TR 7000/TE 110. The images were obtained with 5 mm thick
sections with 1 mm spacing, 220 cm field of view and a
5126256 matrix, except for T2V where 100 sections were
obtained each 1.60 mm in thickness, giving an almost
contiguous appearance.

The MRI examinations were reported independently by the
radiologist on duty at the time of performance of the MRI, and
then separately by an independent radiologist (AS) and a
neurologist (DG). Two neurologists (DG and KN) reported the
scans together, 1 year after the initial analysis. DG and AS were
blinded to the clinical history other than NF1; all reporters were
blinded to the results of other reporters. The results of
independent reporting were then compiled to reach a consensus
view. Each area of abnormal signal intensity on T2 weighted
images was assigned as being either discrete or diffuse. Discrete
lesions were those that were well circumscribed, having a
margin that was distinct from normal tissue. Diffuse lesions
were lesions that were not discrete; the margins of these lesions
were poorly defined. There was complete agreement between
all reporters for discrete lesions. There was occasional disagree-
ment for diffuse lesions. In this case a consensus classification
was reached by two investigators (DG and KN) and two
radiologists (AS and SG) (methodology described in detail in
Gill and colleagues16).

Statistics
Three types of analyses were conducted. The effects of the
presence of hyperintensities was analysed by independent t
tests between those with T2H (T2H+) and those without T2H
(T2H2), with the cognitive test scores as dependent variables.
The frequency of comorbid disorders (ADHD and specific
learning disability) between the two groups was examined
using x2 tests. The effect of the number of hyperintensities was
examined using Spearman correlation coefficients between the
number of T2H and cognitive test scores. The anatomical
location of hyperintensities was analysed with t tests by
comparing the scores of children with hyperintensities in a
particular anatomical location with the scores of children both
without hyperintensities or with hyperintensities elsewhere.
The presence and location of T2H were examined with both
discrete and total T2H count (ie, discrete plus diffuse lesions).

locations. NF1, neurofibromatosis type 1.

For analysis of the number of lesions, only discrete lesions were
used because of the difficulty in delineating the borders of the
diffuse lesions.

Two different methods of calculating cognitive ability scores
were performed. The first method, a simple comparison, used
the standard scores on the cognitive tests to examine whether
the presence, number or location of the T2H was predictive of
their actual performance scores. The second technique used a
pairwise comparison between the NF1 patient and their sibling
controls (as performed in previous studies by Denckla and
colleagues13 30). This method calculated a ‘‘difference score’’ by
subtracting the NF1 patient’s scores from their sibling controls.
This score gives a reflection of the reduction in ‘‘potential
familial’’ cognitive ability, taking into account both family
environment and genetics. Both methods were conducted in
the following analysis to determine whether T2 lesions are
associated with either a general lowering of ability compared
with the normal population or a specific lowering of ability
compared with sibling controls.

RESULTS
Patients with NF1 ranged in age from 8.0 to 16.75 years (mean
11.63 (SD 2.32) years). Among the patients, 47% were female
and 53% were male, with 61% having sporadic NF1 and 39%
familial NF1. Fifty per cent of the cohort had macrocephaly. Of
the 76 patients, 54 (71.1%) had at least one discrete T2H
whereas 22 (28.9%) had no evidence of any discrete lesions.
When taking into account both discrete and diffuse lesions
(total T2H), 68 patients (89.5%) had T2H and only eight
patients (10.5%) had no lesions on T2 weighted images. Of the
54 patients who showed evidence of a discrete lesion, the
number of lesions ranged from 1 to 7, with a mean of 2.96
(median 2, SD 1.78).

The location of T2H in the 76 NF1 children is shown in fig 1.
It is noted that there are large differences between diffuse and
discrete lesions in their location: basal ganglia and hemispheric
T2H were more likely to be discrete whereas lesions in the
thalamus, cerebellum and brainstem were more likely to be
diffuse. When examining the 45 children with NF1 in whom
sibling controls were also studied, there were no significant
differences in the frequency, number or location of T2H
between this subgroup of children with NF1 and the total
NF1 group. Of the 45 pairs, 34 children with NF1 (75.6%) had
discrete T2H and 41 (91.1%) has both discrete and diffuse T2H.
The results of the cognitive assessment have been previously
described in detail.2 31

(T2H2) T2H for the presence of discrete lesions by either the
simple or pairwise comparisons. For the simple comparison
there were also no significant differences in cognition when
taking into account the diffuse lesions (total T2H). Because of
the small number of children without any T2H in the pairwise
comparison group (n = 4), the power was not sufficient to
conduct statistical analyses. T2H were not associated with the
presence of either specific learning disabilities or ADHD. In
general, the frequency of macrocephaly was not significantly
different between the T2H2 and T2H+ groups. Likewise, there
were equal frequencies between the two groups for gender and
sporadic/familial NF1. Those with T2 lesions (discrete and
diffuse) were slightly younger on average (mean 11.4 years)
than those without lesions (mean 13.3 years) (p = 0.029).

(n = 16), corpus callosum (n = 10), cerebellum (n = 11) or
hemispheres (n = 13) compared with children without lesions
in these regions. For discrete thalamic lesions, the sample size
was too small to warrant statistical testing (n = 6) but patients
with discrete lesions in the thalamus showed low levels of
cognitive functioning compared with those without lesions and
with lesions elsewhere. The mean full scale intelligence
quotient (FSIQ) for these patients was 72.8 compared with
those without thalamic lesions who had a mean FSIQ of 91.4
(and controls with a mean of 102.6). They also performed much
lower for Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), Verbal
Comprehension Index, Perceptual Organisation Index (POI),
Freedom From Distractibility and Processing Speed Index
(PSI), with mean scores ranging from 72.0 to 84.0 (borderline
range). They also performed over 1 SD below those without
thalamic lesions for spelling, mathematics, verbal memory,
Judgment of Line Orientation, switching attention, motor
coordination and motor speed. Five of the six children were
male. When diffuse lesions were also taken into account, the
presence of lesions in the thalamus (total T2H) was associated
with a poorer performance on switching attention (Z = 21.31,
p = 0.013) and fine motor coordination (Z = 20.87, p = 0.036)
compared with those without thalamic lesions (Z = 20.64;
Z = 20.16, respectively).

Pairwise comparison. Discrete lesions in the basal ganglia
(n = 27) and brainstem (n = 10) were not associated with a
lowering of any cognitive ability. Owing to the small sample
size of those with lesions in the cerebellum (n = 6), thalamus
(n = 4), corpus callosum (n = 7) and hemispheres (n = 9),
statistical analyses were not conducted because of lack of
power. Qualitatively, patients with lesions in the cerebellum,
corpus callosum and hemispheres had very similar difference
scores to those with lesions elsewhere. However, lesions in the
thalamus were associated with a lowering of FSIQ, VIQ, PIQ,
Verbal Comprehension Index and POI in children with NF1
compared with their siblings. Those with discrete thalamic
lesions performed 28.3 points lower on the FSIQ than their
siblings, compared with those without thalamic lesions, which
were only 9.0 points

differences were seen for many of the other cognitive tests,

When examining total T2H (discrete plus diffuse T2H),
lesions in the basal ganglia (n = 32), brainstem (n = 21),
cerebellum (n = 25) and hemispheres (n = 10) were not
associated with a lowering of either general
intellectual
functioning or any specific cognitive ability. Lesions in the
corpus callosum (n = 9) were too few to calculate statistically,
but qualitatively were similar to those without lesions. Lesions
in the thalamus (n = 28) were associated with a lowering of FSIQ
(p = 0.036), PIQ (p = 0.011), POI (p = 0.002) and PSI (p = 0.017).
Children with T2H in the thalamus performed 14.4 points lower
on the FSIQ compared with their siblings, 13.0 points lower on
PIQ, 14.3 points on POI and 9.7 points on PSI.

DISCUSSION
The results of the study show that discrete T2H are present in
71% of NF1 children whereas when diffuse lesions are also
taken into account, T2H are present in 90% of children. T2H
varied in terms of their frequency and intensity in different
anatomical locations. Basal ganglia and hemispheric T2H were
more likely to be discrete whereas lesions in the thalamus,
cerebellum and brainstem were more likely to be diffuse. A
relationship was found between age of the child with NF1 and
the presence and number of T2H; those with T2H, on average,
were younger than those without T2H, and a greater number of
T2H were found in the younger children. This supports our
previous longitudinal study showing that T2H disappear with
age.32

The current study did not confirm a relationship between the
presence or number of T2H and cognitive ability. We were
unable to replicate the previous results from our own group and
others that supported an association between the presence of
T2H and cognitive dysfunction.10–12 This is probably because of
differences in sample size, as inclusion/exclusion criteria and
demographics of the NF1 cohorts have not varied markedly
between studies and the current study has effectively double
the sample size of our previous study.11 In addition, by using
finer sections through the brain (volume T2 sequence), we have
demonstrated that T2H may be comprised of a number of
poorly delineated lesions. Thus lesion count can be affected by
the sensitivity of the imaging technique used, and previous
analyses correlating the number of lesions with cognitive ability
may not be particularly accurate. We have addressed this
possibility by performing a separate analysis of discrete lesions
(which would be detected using less sensitive MRI techniques)
and diffuse lesions (which could be missed or not counted as
T2H).

Our data add to a growing body of research supporting a
relationship between thalamic lesions and cognitive dysfunc-
tion in children with NF1. While discrete lesions in the
thalamus are relatively rare (,8%), they appear to have an
extreme impact on the NF1 child’s level of general intellectual
functioning, with a lowering of over 18 IQ points compared
with those without discrete thalamic lesions. When familial
and other genetic factors were taken into account by examining
the lowering of cognitive ability in NF1 children compared with
their unaffected siblings, the four pairs of NF1 siblings with
discrete thalamic lesions had extreme differences in cognitive
ability, with the NF1 children having a mean IQ 28 points lower
than their siblings, and falling over 2 SD below their siblings on
a task of sustained attention. The presence of both discrete and
diffuse lesions in the thalamus (present in 28/45 pairs) revealed
a significant, but less severe,
lowering of FSIQ, PIQ and
processing speed when comparing the NF1 children with their
siblings. Examining the lowering of cognitive ability of children
with NF1 compared with their siblings appears to be more
sensitive in detecting the effects of the NF1 gene on cognition
than by comparing group means.

One previous study of children with NF1 found a strong
association between T2H in the thalamus and IQ, memory,
motor skills and attention.15 There is also evidence of a
relationship between T2H in the thalamus and FSIQ and
VIQ,14 as well as between FSIQ and T1 in the nucleus
pulvinarus.33 In addition, lesions in the thalamus are more
likely to evolve into true masses compared with T2H in several
other regions, suggesting that lesions in the thalamus may be
pathologically different to the T2H lesions seen elsewhere.34
Children with NF1 have decreased metabolism in the thalamus
independent of the presence of T2H, suggesting that delays in
thalamic signal processing may contribute to the neuropsycho-
logical deficits.35 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has shown

T2H and cognitive functioning in children with NF1

1091

that NF1 patients had significantly less N-acetylaspartate in the
thalamus than healthy controls.36

It is therefore possible that lesions in the thalamus in
conjunction with thalamic hypometabolism may compound the
level of thalamic dysfunction, resulting in dysfunction well
beyond that produced by T2H in other regions. Support for this
hypothesis is evident in the present study, as discrete lesions in
the thalamus were associated generally with more broad
ranging cognitive deficits (with IQ, academic achievement,
memory, perception and motor skills) as well as with more
severe deficits (lower mean scores and greater difference scores
between NF1 children and their siblings). When diffuse lesions
were also taken into account, lesions in the thalamus were
associated in general with attention and motor problems, and a
lowering of IQ was seen in NF1 children compared with their
siblings. However, the cognitive dysfunction in general was less
widespread and severe than seen with the discrete lesions
alone. This hypothesis has also been suggested by one other
research study that found that smaller thalamic lesions were
associated with cognitive problems.14 The authors postulated
that as regressing lesions are associated with high choline and
low N-acetylaspartate levels, the regressing (ie, smaller) lesions
will be associated with high cell turnover and neuronal loss,
leading to deterioration in cognitive functioning. It is also
possible that a different underlying pathology of T2H in the
thalamus may be causative of the cognitive dysfunction. While
there does not appear to be a relationship between changes in
T2H and changes in cognitive ability,32 further longitudinal
research examining whether changes in the thalamus are
associated with changes in cognitive ability is warranted.
