Abstract
Purpose Mutations and activations of the MEK and PI3K
pathways are associated with the development of many
cancers. GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 are inhibitors of MEK
and PI3K, respectively, currently being evaluated clinically
in combination as anti-cancer treatment. The objective of
these studies was to characterize the relationship between
the plasma concentrations of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941
administered in combination and efﬁcacy in A2058 mela-
noma xenograft.
Methods GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 were administered to
A2058 tumor-bearing mice daily (QD) or every third day
(Q3D) either as single agents or in combination. A semi-
mechanistic population anti-cancer model was developed
to simultaneously describe the tumor growth following

QD/Q3D single-agent and QD combination treatments.
The interaction terms w included in the model were used to
assess whether the combination was additive. Using this
model, data from the Q3D combination regimen were
simulated and compared with the observed tumor volumes.
Results The model consisting of saturable tumor growth
provided the best ﬁt of the data. The estimates for w were
not signiﬁcantly different from 1, suggesting an additive
effect of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 on tumor growth
inhibition. The population rate constants associated with
tumor growth inhibition for GDC-0973 and GDC-0941
were 0.00102 and 0000651 lM-1 h-1, respectively. Using
the model based on single-agent and QD combination
efﬁcacy data, simulations adequately described the tumor
growth from the Q3D combination regimen.
Conclusions These ﬁndings suggest that, based on mini-
mal data, it is possible to predict the effects of various
combinations preclinically and also assess the potential
clinical efﬁcacy of combinations using human pharmaco-
kinetic inputs.

Introduction

Combining multiple targeted anti-cancer agents with the
goal of providing effective therapy has been increasingly
explored in oncology. Many cancers (e.g., melanoma,
colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, NSCLC, and thyroid can-
cers) have a high and overlapping frequency of oncogenic
mutations as well as other genomic alterations that activate
both RAS and PI3K pathways. In tumor cells, inhibition of

either the MEK or PI3K pathway can result in activation of
the other through feedback [30]; therefore, inhibition of
both pathways represents a promising anti-cancer strategy.
This is evidenced by improved in vitro potency and in vivo
efﬁcacy observed from combined PI3K and MEK inhibi-
tion in preclinical efﬁcacy models [5, 14].

The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is involved
in cellular responses relevant to tumorigenesis, including
cell proliferation, invasion, survival and angiogenesis. This
pathway is activated by a diverse array of growth factors,
cytokines and proto-oncogenes, which transduce their
growth-promoting signals through the activation of the small
G protein RAS. Activation of RAS leads to the activation of
RAF followed by the activation of MEK, which then
phosphorylates and activates ERK [10, 17, 28, 29, 38].
GDC-0973 ([3,4-Diﬂuoro-2-(2-ﬂuoro-4-iodo-phenylamino)-
phenyl]-((S)-3-hydroxy-3-piperidin-2-yl-azetidin-1-yl)-
methanone) (Fig 1a) is a MEK1/2 inhibitor. It is potent and
selective in biochemical and cell-based assays with an IC50
estimate of 0.004 lM against the puriﬁed MEK1 enzyme, a
cellular pERK IC50 of 0.009 lM in the HCT116 cell line
and an IC50 of 6.9 lM against A2058 cell proliferation. It
also has broad in vivo efﬁcacy in xenograft models with
BRAF and KRAS mutations [13].

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling path-
way, a parallel pathway to MEK, is a major downstream
effector of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as human epi-
dermal growth factor-2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor
that stimulates cell proliferation, promotes survival and
inhibits apoptosis. Abnormal regulation of this central
signaling pathway has been identiﬁed in a large number of
cancer types and occurs through various mechanisms [1, 2,
4, 8, 16, 19, 25, 31].

GDC-0941 (2-(1H-Indazol-4-yl)-6-(4-methanesulfo-nyl-
piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-morpholin-4-yl-thieno[3,2-d]

123

pyrimidine) (Fig. 1b) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of
the PI3K pathway currently being evaluated in phase II
studies as an anti-cancer agent [26]. It is selective for the
class I (a, b, d, c) PI3K [9] and is efﬁcacious against the
U87MG glioblastoma and IGROV-1 human ovarian cancer
xenograft models in athymic mice [22]. GDC-0941 is
considered an inhibitor of class I PI3K isoforms with IC50
of 0.003, 0.033, 0.003 and 0.075 lM against p110a, b, d
and c, respectively. It potently inhibits the phosphorylation
of downstream Akt in PC3-NCI (prostate) and MCF7.1
cells (breast), with IC50 ranging from 0.028 to 0.037 lM. It
is also able to inhibit the proliferation of MCF7.1, PC3-
NCI and A2058 cells with IC50’s of 0.72 lM, 0.28 lM and
2.1 lM, respectively [9, 13].

Currently, GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 are being admin-
istered as single agents and in combination in cancer
patients (www.clinicaltrials.gov). However, prior to clini-
cal combination trials, initial proof-of-concept studies were
conducted using mouse xenograft models.

These investigations in preclinical models provided
useful information when comparing efﬁcacy from admin-
istration of a single compound to efﬁcacy observed fol-
lowing co-administration of two compounds. In mouse
models, factorial combinations that would not be accept-
able in human subjects can be explored to better understand
the drug interaction proﬁle in vivo. To inform clinical
studies, it is often useful to determine the target exposure/
dose associated with efﬁcacy and the regimen that maxi-
mizes the efﬁcacy of single or combination therapy.
However, direct extrapolation of exposure from mouse to
human may be confounded by differences in the pharma-
cokinetics between mouse and human. Therefore, to further
leverage the xenograft efﬁcacy data, pharmacokinetic–
pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling and simulations
were conducted. The objectives of the present studies
were to characterize the efﬁcacy of the combination of

GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 in vivo, develop a PK-PD
model describing the relationship between the plasma
concentrations of both agents and A2058 tumor growth
inhibition, and verify that the model could be utilized to
predict efﬁcacy for different dosing regimens with minimal
xenograft efﬁcacy data.

Materials and methods

Chemicals

GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 were provided by Genentech
Inc (South San Francisco, USA). Solvents used for analysis
were of analytical or HPLC grade (Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA). All other reagents or material used
in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St
Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise stated. The Genentech
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all
procedures in animals.

Pharmacokinetic studies in mouse

Female athymic nu/nu mice weighing 25–28 g (Charles
River Laboratories, Hollister, CA, USA) were administered
oral doses of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg GDC-0973 in 0.5 %
methylcellulose/0.2 % Tween 80 (MCT). The pharmaco-
kinetics of GDC-0941 in nu/nu mouse was previously
described [24]. The pharmacokinetics of GDC-0973 (3 mg/
kg) and GDC-0941 (100 mg/kg) was also evaluated when
dosed in combination. Blood samples (*1 mL) from these
studies were collected at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and
24 h post-dose via cardiac puncture (terminal collection)
into tubes containing potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (K2EDTA) anti-coagulant. Immediately upon collec-
tion, the blood was mixed with K2EDTA and stored on ice.
Within 30 min, blood samples were centrifuged at
approximately 1,000–1,5009g for 5 min at 4 °C, and
plasma was harvested. Plasma samples were stored at
-80 °C until analysis.

Samples were prepared for analysis by placing a 25 lL
aliquot into a 96-well plate followed by the addition of
25 lL of internal standard and 200 lL acetonitrile. After
the samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at
3,400 rpm, 50 lL of the supernatant was diluted with
350 lL of water, of which 20 lL was injected onto the
column. Concentrations of GDC-0973 in plasma were
determined by a LC/MS/MS assay using a Sciex API 3,000
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) connected with a CTC HTS PAL
autosampler
(LEAP Technologies, Chapel Hill, NC).
Chromatographic separation was achieved with gradient
elution on an ACE 5 phenyl column (100 9 2.1 mm,

5 lm) (MAC-MOD Analytical, Chadds Ford, CA, USA) at
room temperature and a pair of Shimadzu LC-10AD pumps
with a SCL-10A controller (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD,
USA). The aqueous mobile phase was water with 0.1 %
formic acid, and the organic mobile phase was acetonitrile
with 0.1 % formic acid. The gradient elution was run at
0.500 mL/min ﬂow rate from 20 to 80 % organic in 1 min
with the total run time of 5 min. Ionization was conducted
in the positive ion mode at an ionspray interface temper-
ature of 450o C, using nitrogen nebulizing and heating gas.
GDC-0973 and the internal standard (13C-stable label)
were analyzed in the MRM mode using the transitions m/z
532.1 ? 249.1 and 401.2 ? 322.2, respectively. Calibra-
tion curve, which ranged from 0.005 to 10 lM for GDC-
to a 1/x2 weighted quadratic regression
0973, was ﬁt
model. The concentration of GDC-0973 samples was
determined by interpolation from the standard curve. A run
was deemed acceptable when quality control (QC) samples
were ±25 % of the nominal concentration, except the lowest
QC where ±30 % was accepted. The dynamic range of the
GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 assays was 0.005–10 lM.

Xenograft efﬁcacy studies

All procedures
involving animals were performed in
accordance with Genentech’s Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee guidelines. To generate tumors, A2058
cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were harvested in the
log phase of growth and resuspended in 50 % Matrigel
matrix (BC Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) in phosphate-
buffered saline at a concentration of 5 9 107 cells/mL.
Each 9–10-week-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan,
Sommerville, NJ, USA) included in the study received a
subcutaneous injection of 1 9 107 A2058 cells (0.2 mL
cell suspension) into the right ﬂank. Tumor volume (TV)
was calculated from diameters using the formula:
TV (mm3Þ ¼ a  b2  0:5;

where a and b are the shortest and longest perpendicular
tumor diameters, respectively.

Tumor volumes and body weights were measured at
least twice weekly until the end of the study. Mice were
euthanized if their tumor volume exceeded 2,000 mm3 and/
or if their body weight dropped by more than 20 %. GDC-
0973, GDC-0941 or the vehicle (control) were adminis-
tered orally by gavage in a volume of 200 lL once tumor
volumes reached 100–300 mm3 (8–10 days post inocula-
tion). Treatment groups (n = 7 mice per group) received
oral doses of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941, as a single agent
or as combinations either on a daily (QD) or on a once-
every-third-day (Q3D) regimen for 20 or 21 days. The
treatment groups in the xenograft efﬁcacy experiments
included in this study were as follows:

Preclinical pharmacokinetics

Mouse PK parameters of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 were
obtained by ﬁtting the PK model to mean concentration–
time proﬁles of the compounds using SAAM II (Saam
Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA).
The PK data of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 were described
by a one-compartment model with linear absorption and
elimination according to the following:
Ct ¼

 ðe kt   e KatÞ

Ka  Dose

ð1Þ

ðKa   KeÞ  V=F

where Ct represents the mean plasma concentrations, Ka is
absorption rate constant, Ke is elimination rate constant
and V/F is volume of distribution.

Pharmacokinetic–Pharmacodynamic (PK-PD)
Modeling

A semi-mechanistic anti-cancer model was used to simul-
taneously describe the tumor growth data after vehicle,
single-agent and combination administration of GDC-0973
and/or GDC-0941. The model was constructed to mimic
the physiological process and consisted of linear or satu-
rable tumor growth and drug response model. The differ-
ential equation describing the semi-mechanistic model is as
follows:
dðTVÞ

¼ kngðTVÞð1   TGÞ   E0973  w1

 TV   E0941  w2  TV

ð2Þ

dt

123

Cancer Chemother Pharmacol (2013) 71:133–143

TV (mm3) is deﬁned as the tumor volume and t (h) is time.
TG is a tumor growth model, where TG = 0 for linear
growth and TG = TV/TVmax for logistic and saturable
tumor growth where TVmax is the maximum growth
capacity of tumors. E0973 and E0941 are the linear or satu-
rable drug response models that are used to describe the
anti-tumor effect of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941, respec-
tively (Eqs. 3 and 4).

Linear drug response model:

E0973 ¼ A0973  C0973 and E0941 ¼ A0941  C0941

Saturable drug response model:

E0973 ¼ E max0973  C0973
EC50 0973 þ C0973

E0941 ¼ E max0941  C0941
EC50 0941 þ C0941

ð3Þ

ð4Þ

where A0973 and A0941 represent the linear tumor growth
inhibition effect of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941, respectively.
C0973 and C0941 (lM) are the plasma concentrations of GDC-
0973 and GDC-0941, respectively. For the saturable drug
response model, Emax0973 and Emax0941 represent
the
maximum tumor inhibition effects of GDC-0973 and GDC-
0941, respectively. EC50-0973 and EC50-0941 correspond to
the concentration at half-maximal tumor inhibition of GDC-
0973 and GDC-0941, respectively. The terms w1 and w2 are
the interaction terms that are used to determine the interac-
tion of each agent on each other during co-administration of
GDC-0973 and GDC-0941, respectively. This interaction
term concept was previously described by Koch et al. [15].
The values of w1 and w2 describe ‘‘additive’’ anti-tumor
effects of each agent on each other when they are not sig-
niﬁcantly different from 1, and w values signiﬁcantly greater
or less than 1 signify the ‘‘greater-than’’ (or ‘‘synergistic’’) or
‘‘less-than’’ (or ‘‘antagonistic’’) additive anti-tumor effect
from co-administration of the two agents. Hence, these
interaction terms can be used to indicate the nature and
intensity of the drug interactions.

To analyze the pooled tumor growth data from different
studies (single and combination treatments) and repeated
measurement of tumor volumes from the same animals over
time appropriately, a nonlinear-mixed effect modeling
approach with the Monte Carlo parametric expectation
maximization (MCPEM) method implemented in S-ADAPT
program [3, 20] was used to obtain the population model
parameters. This population modeling approach addresses
both repeated measurements and modest dropouts due to any
non-treatment-related death of animals before the end of
study [21]. The inter-individual variability among the model
parameters were assumed to be log-normally distributed.
Intra-individual variability was modeled with proportional
error according to the following equations:
yij ¼ ypij þ ypij  eij

ð5Þ

Cancer Chemother Pharmacol (2013) 71:133–143

137

where yij and ypij are the jth measured and model-predicted
values, respectively, for the ith individual mice, and eij
denote the proportional residual intra-individual random
errors distributed with zero means and variances r2. To
discriminate between two nested population models, a
difference in an objective function of greater than 3.84 (1
degree of freedom with v2 distribution), which corresponds
to a signiﬁcant level of p \ 0.05 was used. AIC model
selection criterion was used to discriminate non-nested
population model.

To test the ability of the model to predict the tumor
growth data from new combination regimens, only data
from studies with a single-agent (QD and Q3D) and
combination treatments with QD regimens were used to
develop the population model. The ﬁnal population model
was then used to simulate the tumor growth data from
combination treatments with the Q3D dosing regimen. The
results from the simulated studies were compared with the
observed data and used to provide evidence that the derived
population model could be used to describe the observed
data from studies with new dosage regimens.

Results

Preclinical pharmacokinetics

The mean plasma concentration–time plots of GDC-0973
in mice at doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg are shown in
Fig. 1a. The preclinical pharmacokinetic parameters of
GDC-0973 were estimated as follows: Ka = 0.579 h-1,
Ke = 0.185 h-1 and V/F = 18.7 L/kg (Fig. 2a). The esti-
mated parameters for GDC-0941 were previously descri-
bed [24] and are as follows: Ka = 10.4 h-1, Ke =
0.228 h-1 and V/F = 19.9 L/kg. These parameters were
used to simulate GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 plasma con-
centrations when ﬁtting the model to the tumor volume
data from xenograft efﬁcacy studies. The pharmacokinetics
of either compound was unaffected by the co-administra-
tion of either agent (Fig. 2b).

Xenograft efﬁcacy

Tumor growth curves following a range of GDC-0973 and
GDC-0941 single-agent oral doses administered daily (QD)
and every 3rd day (Q3D) in A2058 (BRAFV600E, PTENnull
melanoma) xenograft tumor -bearing mice are shown in
Figs. 3a–b and 4c–d, respectively. Tumor growth curve
following combination of varying doses of GDC-0973
and GDC-0941 are shown in Fig. 4a–f. Overall, as sin-
gle agents, administration of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941
resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in
A2058 xenografts. At the highest single-agent doses tested,

GDC-0973 achieved tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of
73 % and 68 % when dosed QD and Q3D, respectively.
GDC-0941, at the highest doses, achieved a TGI of *69 %
when dosed QD and 50 % when dosed Q3D. When dosed
in combination, one partial response (20 mg/kg GDC-0973
and 100 mg/kg GDC-0941) and a complete response
(10 mg/kg GDC-0973 and 150 mg/kg GDC-0941) were
observed with the combination Q3D regimen.

Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK-PD)
modeling

the ﬁt of this modiﬁed model

A semi-mechanistic population model was developed to
describe the pooled tumor growth data after vehicle, single-
agent and combination treatment with GDC-0973 and
GDC-0941 in the xenograft mouse model. A total of 1201
tumor growth data from 161 animals were used to develop
the ﬁnal population model. Initially, the model with linear
tumor growth and drug response model with no drug
interaction, with the assumption of an additive effect (w1
and w2 were ﬁxed to 1), was developed. The model,
however, failed to describe the tumor growth data. There-
fore, the model was modiﬁed by adding saturable tumor
growth components while w1 and w2 were ﬁxed to 1. As a
result,
to the data was
markedly improved (p \ 0.05). Further modiﬁcation of the
model with saturable drug response components (Eq. 4)
did not signiﬁcantly improve the model ﬁt (p [ 0.05), and
the EC50 values for both drugs were poorly estimated (%SE
[50). In addition, allowing the ﬂexibility of the model
to estimate the interaction terms w1 and w2 did not result
in signiﬁcant decrease in the objective function and
improvement of model ﬁt. Furthermore, the model esti-
mates of the w1 and w2 did not signiﬁcantly differ from 1,
suggesting that the combination of GDC-0973 and GDC-
0941 had additive effects on tumor growth inhibition in the
xenograft mouse model. Therefore, the ﬁnal population
model consisted of saturable tumor growth, linear drug
response and an additive effect for combination of GDC-
0973 and GDC-0941 on tumor growth inhibition.

The ﬁnal model reasonably predicted the observed tumor
growth data after vehicle, single-agent and combination
(QD) treatment of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941. Figure 5a
shows individual predicted versus observed tumor volume
data for all animals. Generally, there was good agreement
between the predicted and observed individual data, and the
diagnostic plots of the ﬁnal model identiﬁed no systematic
bias (Fig. 5b–d). Representative plots of observed and
model-predicted tumor volume in four animals receiving
vehicle,
single-agent and combination treatments of
GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 are shown in Supplemental
Figure 1A–D. These plots further demonstrated that the
ﬁnal model reasonably described the observed data. The

0973 (c); the overlapping curves suggest that co-administration of
either compound with the other does not alter its pharmacokinetics
(presented as concentration ± SD; n = 3 per time point)

estimated ﬁnal population model parameters are presented
in Table 1. The population mean rate constant associated
with tumor inhibition for GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 were
0.00102 and 0.00065 lM-1 h-1, respectively. The popu-
lation mean maximum growth capacity of tumors TVmax
was 3947 mm3. The ﬁnal PK/PD and inter- and intra-sub-
ject variability parameters for GDC-0973 and GDC-0941
were estimated with good precision, with percent standard
error of the parameter estimates \50 %.

This ﬁnal population model was then used to simulate
the tumor volume–time proﬁle from animals that received
different dosages and combination regimens not included
in the dataset used for model development. These animals
received different doses of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 on
Q3D regimens. The results from the simulated results
were compared with the observed data (Supplemental
Figure 2A–B). In general, the simulated results agreed with

those observed in the study. This indicates that our
understanding of the drug exposure and tumor response
relationships was adequate and allowed us to predict the
time course of tumor response after single-agent and
combination treatment of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 in the
A2058 xenograft mouse model.

Discussion

PK-PD modeling and simulations have increasingly been
incorporated into the drug discovery and development
process [18]. Although the structure of the models utilized
may vary,
the overall goal of PK-PD modeling is to
integrate information from various experiments to facili-
tate decision making, for example, dose/schedule selec-
tion and trial design. In oncology, xenograft tumor models

are the main pharmacology model used to evaluate New
Molecular Entities (NME) [33]. The information from
PK-PD modeling of mouse xenograft efﬁcacy data has
been useful in extrapolating data from mouse to humans
[6, 11, 32, 34, 35]. To date, most of the data from PK-PD
modeling has been from single-agent efﬁcacy studies.
However, cancer treatments are more frequently com-
bined, usually with standard of care chemotherapy, but
increasingly with other targeted agents to maximize efﬁ-
cacy and/or
to avoid resistance by targeting parallel
pathways. To support these clinical regimens, preclinical
efﬁcacy studies with combined agents are usually con-
ducted. Several approaches can be used in analyzing the
effects of combination, such as the Chou and Talalay
combination index in vitro [6], and the isobologram
method in vivo [12]. However, these approaches do not
take into account inputs of dynamic changes in concen-
trations (i.e., pharmacokinetics), and as such, cannot be
utilized to predict effects in human based on changes in
the concentration–time proﬁle.

As combined agents including combinations of 2
NME’s are tested earlier in the drug development process,
when optimal dosing regimens for either compound are yet
to be determined, preclinical PK-PD modeling becomes
even more important. Therefore, in order to utilize the
preclinical efﬁcacy data from administration of combined
agents, PK-PD modeling has recently been applied to
describe combination xenograft efﬁcacy data [11, 15, 23].
For instance, Rocchetti et al. [23] described the modeling
of efﬁcacy data from combined agents based on additivity
of the effects from each agent. However, these authors
mainly assessed the adequacy of their model by testing the
goodness of ﬁt in a study that included only 4 groups.
Goteti et al. [11] proposed a similar model to predict tumor
growth, assuming synergy between AZD7762 (a check-
point kinase inhibitor) and irinotecan. In addition, they
modiﬁed their model to interrogate the optimal dosing
interval of two agents, AZD7762 and ﬂavopiridol. The
doses and interval predicted for the optimal efﬁcacy of
irinotecan in combination with AZD7762 and ﬂavopiridol

Fig. 4 Xenograft efﬁcacy data (mean tumor volume ± SEM; n = 7)
after QD administration of 1 mg/kg (a), 6 mg/kg (b) and 10 mg/kg
(c) of GDC-0973 in combination with 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg QD of
GDC-0941 (top panel). Xenograft efﬁcacy data (mean tumor

volume ± SEM; n = 7) after Q3D administration of 10 mg/kg (d),

based on their modeling appeared to be consistent with the
reported effective clinical doses and schedules, respec-
tively [11]. In these examples, the potency of each indi-
vidual compound on tumor growth was initially determined
and then ﬁxed when modeling combination efﬁcacy data.
The modeling approach proposed here to describe the
combination effect of GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 was a
logical extension of the indirect response models that have
been used to characterize single-agent xenograft efﬁcacy
data from a number of kinase inhibitors [24, 36]. The
population model was developed by simultaneously ﬁtting
the model to the majority of tumor volume versus time
data from single-agent and combination treatments. The
approach is similar to the model described by Koch et al.
[15], where a multiplicative ‘‘interaction factor’’ was
included in the equation to assess the nature and intensity
of the interaction between the two drugs. However, rather
than assuming that one agent affects the other, and not vice
versa, we have incorporated an interaction factor, associ-
ated with each agent, assuming that efﬁcacy of each
compound could be contributing to a ‘‘less-than’’ or
‘‘greater-than’’ additive effect. In addition, the population
modeling approach utilized in the study allows us to obtain

reliable model parameter estimates from combining the
data from different studies.

Although ‘‘additive’’ models have been previously pro-
posed [11, 15, 23], this study is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst
application of such a model to a large dataset and study
design. Based on the model and simulations, the ‘‘addi-
tivity’’ of tumor growth inhibition from each agent
in
A2058 xenografts holds up across the range of doses tested,
as well as different regimens that is, Q3D. While this
model is speciﬁc in describing the in vivo effects of GDC-
0973 and GDC-0941 on A2058 xenograft tumors, we have
found that it also applies to other tumors (DLD-1; colo-
rectal cancer KRASG13D) [13] for this combination. In the
case of the dataset with A2058 xenografts, using the
‘‘additive’’ model described the combination effect of
GDC-0973 and GDC-0941 adequately. This is consistent
with the lack of pharmacokinetic interaction when these
two compounds are co-administered and the biological
activity of both compounds on parallel pathways, as
described in detail by Hoeﬂich et al. [13].

Once established, such a model can be applied to
describe and simulate combination efﬁcacy using different
dosing regimens (e.g., once every 2 days) without the need

further experimental data,

for
thus saving time and
expense. The overarching goal in setting up this model is to
be able to apply it to the clinical situation and therefore
guide the clinical study design. For instance, based on
substitution of human pharmacokinetic parameters for
mouse pharmacokinetic parameters, we can predict doses
at which signs of efﬁcacy can be expected or simulate and

predict efﬁcacy at tolerated clinical doses and regimens.
The information from these simulations is particularly
important
for combinations of NME where limited
knowledge of clinical efﬁcacy is available. There are
caveats to this modeling approach such as the assumption
that
the growth rate of xenografts is maintained from
mouse to humans. However, despite the limitations, the
xenograft models continue to be the mainstay of preclinical
assessment of anti-tumor efﬁcacy [7, 27] and utilizing the
data in a more quantitative manner is beneﬁcial. Recently,
it has been shown by PK-PD modeling and simulation that
anti-tumor activity of targeted agents in genotypic-appro-
priate murine subcutaneous tumor model correlated with
clinical response [37].

The model described here is not intended to provide full
mechanistic/biological information per se. However, the
simplicity of this modeling approach means that one could
generate similar information on combination agents from
multiple tumor types representing different genotypes.
These data will not only provide insight into the applica-
bility of xenograft models in predicting clinical outcome
but, collectively, this information would also be useful in
guiding rational dosing regimens in the clinic as well as
provide an assessment of target exposures that may be

required clinically. Finally, as PK-PD modeling and sim-
ulations become increasingly applied in the drug develop-
ment process, it will be important to conduct retrospective
analysis as clinical efﬁcacy data become available in order
to gain insights into model reﬁnement and application.
