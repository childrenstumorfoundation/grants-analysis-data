Abstract
Simultaneous interrogation of tumor genomes and transcriptomes is underway in unprecedented global efforts.
Yet, despite the essential need to separate driver mutations modulating gene expression networks from
transcriptionally inert passenger mutations, robust computational methods to ascertain the impact of individual
mutations on transcriptional networks are underdeveloped. We introduce a novel computational framework,
DriverNet, to identify likely driver mutations by virtue of their effect on mRNA expression networks. Application to
four cancer datasets reveals the prevalence of rare candidate driver mutations associated with disrupted
transcriptional networks and a simultaneous modulation of oncogenic and metabolic networks, induced by copy
number co-modification of adjacent oncogenic and metabolic drivers. DriverNet is available on Bioconductor or at
http://compbio.bccrc.ca/software/drivernet/.
Keywords: driver mutations, sequencing, cancer, transcriptional networks.

Background
Cancer genome sequencing experiments are designed to
enumerate all somatic mutations within a cancer. Some of
these mutations will serve as actionable genomic aberra-
tions upon which to develop and apply targeted therapies
(for example, mutations in PIK3CA, BRAF, and KRAS)
and ultimately enabling rational frameworks for improved
clinical management and patient care based on precise
genomic patterns of somatic alteration. To this end, next
generation sequencing (NGS) technology has shifted the
rate-limiting step from identifying all cancer mutations in
a sequenced genome to identifying the relatively few func-
tional mutations that drive the phenotype of malignant
cells. Therein lies a major challenge in the cancer geno-
mics field: distinguishing pathogenic, driver mutations
from the so-called passenger mutations that accrue sto-
chastically, but do not confer selective advantages.

In order to discover novel driver mutations, several
large-scale sequencing initiatives such as The Cancer Gen-
ome Atlas project (TCGA, for example, [1]) are generating
simultaneous whole genome and transcriptome interroga-
tions for hundreds of cases of the same tumor type. This
opens the possibility of ascribing the impact of individual
somatic mutations on gene expression networks. Initial
observations in high-throughput datasets, coupled with
innumerable functional studies suggest that driver muta-
tions are expected to alter gene expression of their cognate
proteins, their interacting partners, or genes that share the
same biochemical pathway. This will lead to a correlated
pattern of gene expression in a network of genes asso-
ciated with a driver mutation, which differs from benign
passenger mutations with little to no phenotype. More-
over, somatic aberrations in genes may alter more than
one transcriptional network, thus enabling the enumera-
tion of a group of pathways driven by a single genomic
event. The importance of placing mutations in the context
of their gene expression has been illuminated recently by
Prahallad and colleagues [2], who established the thera-
peutic effect of PLX4032 against the BRAF V600E onco-
protein, which is mechanistically linked to the activation

of EGFR. Thus, differential expression of EGFR in different
cell types (colon cancers versus melanomas) has a dra-
matic impact on drug efficacy. Consequently, knowing
active pathways coupled with mutational profiles will be
critical for implementation of therapeutic decisions
informed by the presence of mutations in a cancer.

Current approaches for driver analysis typically rely on
the frequency of aberration of a given gene or locus in a
population of tumors as a function of the background
mutation rate (for example, [3-5]). Recent whole gen-
ome interrogations, however, have revealed the vast
majority of mutated genes exhibit low population fre-
quencies [6-10]. While most of these events can be
explained by stochastically acquired mutations due to
increased proliferation or acquisition of mutagenic pro-
cesses, with no oncogenic properties, many others are in
fact well-known pathogenic mutations with, in some
cases, actionable clinical utility. For example, sequencing
of complete exomes of 316 ovarian cancers [7] and 65
triple negative breast cancers [11] revealed rare but
functionally important and actionable mutations (for
example, in ERBB2 and BRAF) in a small percentage of
cases that were not identified by frequency and back-
ground mutation rate analyses. Thus, frequency analysis
will fail to recognize infrequent, but nonetheless impor-
tant driver mutations.

We suggest that integrative analysis of genomic aberra-
tions and transcriptional profiles in cancer will reveal
somatic mutations that drive biological processes, regard-
less of the population frequency. Furthermore, we propose
that biological networks can be leveraged to relate muta-
tions to their consequent effect on transcription and gene
expression. Figure 1A shows an example of high-level
amplification of EGFR in a glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) tumor, accompanied by the coincident outlying
expression of genes that are connected to EGFR through
known biological pathways. We note that BRAF in this
case, although not amplified itself, exhibits elevated
expression compared to the population distribution. Other
genes known to interact with EGFR exhibit similar
extreme changes in expression levels in this example, such
that PI3K signaling and MAPK signaling could be affected
by this single genomic event. Figure 1B shows fitted Gaus-
sian expression distributions of three genes that interact
with EGFR: FGF11, PIK3R1, and PRKACB, and shows that
some cases with outlying expression have coincident
EGFR amplifications. Our assumption is that amplification
of EGFR in these cases has driven expression of the exam-
ple genes to the tails of their respective distributions.
Thus, extreme changes in expression levels of genes
related to genomic aberrations are observable in orthogon-
ally measured high-throughput transcriptome assays. As
such, simultaneous analysis of genome and transcriptome
measurements should amplify important signals in the

data. Motivated by this idea, we hypothesize that driver
aberrations will measurably disrupt transcriptional profiles
regardless of their frequency in the population.

Algorithmic frameworks to exploit the relationship
between genomic events and consequent changes in gene
expression to nominate putative driver genes are underde-
veloped. We therefore propose an integrated genome/
transcriptome analysis framework, called DriverNet, to
contextualize genomic aberrations (for example, mutations
and copy number alterations) by their effect on transcrip-
tional networks and identify candidate genomic aberra-
tions suitable for functional experimental follow-up. Our
approach allows individual mutations to be related to
coincident changes in gene expression and assigns statisti-
cal significance to candidate predictions, thus quantita-
tively and rationally prioritizing candidate genes. We note
that our intent differs from complementary approaches
such as the one described by Vaske et al. [12], which aims
at nominating driver pathways rather than driver genes in
cancer, and from those that leverage genome data without
considering expression [4,13]. Both Masica and Karchin
[14] and Ciriello et al. [15] integrate genome and tran-
scriptome relationships in their framework; however, they
differ from our approach, since Masica and Karchin [14]
do not utilize known biological pathway information and
Ciriello et al. [15] only consider mRNA expression asso-
ciated with copy number aberrations and not with muta-
tions. Other methods focusing on copy number and
expression associations do not consider mutations, nor do
they employ the use of previously annotated pathways
[16,17].

To study the properties and advantages of our approach,
we analyzed four large-scale genome-transcriptome inter-
rogations of tumor populations (Table 1) in human glio-
mas, triple negative breast cancers, a population of nearly
1,000 breast tumors (all subtypes) and high-grade serous
ovarian cancers. We present results from three experi-
ments: i) ascertainment of sensitivity and specificity in the
context of several cancer datasets; ii) enumeration of well-
known, but infrequent, drivers modulating transcriptional
networks, and iii) identification of complex driver events
that implicate compound metabolic and oncogenic path-
way modulation from single genomic events.

Results
Overview of DriverNet approach
We developed a novel, integrated algorithmic approach
(DriverNet) to analyze population-based genomic and
transcriptomic interrogations of tumor (sub)types for iden-
tification of pathogenic driver mutations. Our approach
relates genomic aberrations to disrupted transcriptional
patterns, informed by known associations or interactions
between genes. The full details of the algorithm are
described in the Online Methods, but will be summarized

Figure 1 A schematic showing how DriverNet works. (a) An example of a Cytoscape visualization of a glioblastoma patient with a high-level
amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (shown in green) and coincident outlying expression of genes connected to EGFR in the
Reactome influence graph (shown in yellow). Examples of the overrepresented pathways (by Reactome FI plug-in for Cytoscape, FDR < 0.001) from
the list of genes showing outlying expression associated with the EGFR amplification are depicted at the bottom. The box plot shows the population-
level expression distribution of BRAF, an interacting protein with EGFR, and where the specific case with EGFR amplification sits on that distribution
(red ‘x’). We note that in this case, BRAF itself is not mutated or amplified. (b) Fitted Gaussian expression distributions of three genes that interact with
EGFR: FGF11, PIK3R1, and PRKACB, with each point indicating the probability density function for individual cases. For each gene, blue dots indicate
cases with mutations in the gene itself and red arrows indicate cases with outlying expression with coincident EGFR amplifications. (c) Schematic
representation of the DriverNet approach. Given the genomic aberration states for different patients and genes, gene expression data, and the
influence graph, which captures biological pathway information, the bipartite graph shown on the right is constructed. Green nodes on the left
partition of the bipartite graph correspond to aberrated genes and nodes on the right represent the outlying expression status for each patient where
red indicates outlying patient-gene events from the gene expression matrix. The genes with the highest number of outlying expression events (for
example, g2) are nominated as putative drivers.

here in brief. Shown schematically in Figure 1C, DriverNet
formulates associations between mutations and expression
levels using a bipartite graph where nodes are: i) the set of
genes representing the mutation status (the left partition
of the graph) and ii) the set of genes representing outlying
expression status in each of the patients (the right partition
of the graph). For each patient, an edge between the nodes
on the left and right partitions of the graph is drawn if the
following three conditions are all satisfied: i) gene gi is
mutated in patient p of the population (green nodes on
the left partition of the graph); ii) gene gj shows outlying
expression in patient p (red nodes on the right partition of
the graph); and iii) gi and gj are known to interact accord-
ing to pathway or gene set databases (an ‘influence graph’
after [18]). Our method then uses a greedy optimization
approach to explain as many nodes on the right partition
of the bipartite graph as possible using the fewest number
of nodes on the left partition of the graph such that the
genes explaining the highest number of outlying expres-
sion events (for example, g2 in Figure 1C) are nominated
as putative driver genes. Finally, we apply statistical signifi-
cance tests to these candidates based on null distributions
informed by stochastic resampling.

Datasets
For our analysis, we used four publicly available datasets
that contain genome and transcriptome data of several
tumor types (Table 1). Detailed descriptions of the analysis
of the datasets and pre-processing workflows can be found
in Additional file 1. The GBM dataset represents copy
number, mutations and expression data for 120 glioblas-
toma multiforme patients [6] taken from the TCGA portal
[19]. Note that the cases which had both mutation and
copy number data were included in this dataset. The
METABRIC dataset [20] represents copy number altera-
tions and accompanying gene expression data for 997
breast cancer patients. TN represents the validated muta-
tions, copy number, and expression data for 66 triple
negative breast cancer patients [11]. The TCGA HGS
dataset contains mutations, copy number, and expression
data for 304 high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients [7]
that were taken from the TCGA portal. Like the GBM
dataset, we only included the cases which had both

mutation and copy number data. The data analysis work-
flow is shown schematically in Additional file 2. The
GBM2, TN2, and HGS2 datasets represent mutations only
and gene expression data for 140, 66, and 307 glioblas-
toma, triple negative, and high-grade serous ovarian can-
cer patients, respectively.

Performance benchmarking analysis establishes DriverNet
as a sensitive and specific algorithm
In practice, quantitative measurements with standard sen-
sitivity/specificity benchmarking techniques are impracti-
cal in the absence of ground truth. However, due to the
availability of well-studied cancer gene databases, includ-
ing the cancer gene census (CGC) [21] and the catalogue
of somatic mutations in cancer datasets (COSMIC) [22],
we set out to approximate performance metrics and com-
pare DriverNet with the following two competing meth-
ods: i) a method described by Masica and Karchin [14],
which uses correlation-based statistics followed by a Fisher
exact test to associate mutations with gene expression pat-
terns (referred to as ‘Fisher’, see Additional file 1), ii) a
method described in Youn and Simon [5], which identifies
driver genes based on the background mutation rate, func-
tional impact on proteins, and redundancy in genetic code
(referred to as ‘Frequency’). In adherence to both
approaches mentioned above, we removed copy number
data from the analysis and restricted the comparisons to
mutation data only (GBM2, TN2, and HGS2, Table 1),
resulting in the exclusion of the METABRIC dataset as it
contained copy number aberration data only. We used
two systematic benchmarking measures as follows:
i) examining the proportion of predictions found in the
Cancer Gene Census (CGC) database [21]; ii) examining
the prevalence of somatic mutations of candidate genes in
accordance with the COSMIC database, assuming genes
with higher mutation prevalence in the corresponding
patient population of interest in COSMIC (glioblastoma,
breast and ovarian cancer) are more likely to be driver
genes. Theoretically, this measure should favor the Fre-
quency approach.

To systematically evaluate specificity, we compared the
proportion of predictions that were present in CGC as a
function of decreasing sensitivity thresholds (Figure 2A,

Top N Ranked Genes

Fisher−based Approach
Frequency-based Approach
DriverNet

Figure 2 DriverNet performance benchmarking with the GBM2, HGS2, and HGS2 datasets. (A-C) Concordance with Cancer Gene Census
for DriverNet, Frequency-based, and Fisher-based approaches as a function of the top N ranked genes (out of 200) for the GBM2, TN2, and
HGS2 datasets, respectively. (D-F) Concordance with the COSMIC database (cumulative distribution of mutation prevalence in the COSMIC
database) for DriverNet, Frequency-based, and Fisher-based approaches as a function of the top N ranked genes (out of 200) for the GBM2, TN2,
and HGS2 datasets, respectively. Note that for the GBM2 dataset, DriverNet nominates 113 genes as candidate drivers, therefore, the
concordance of DriverNet genes with the Cancer Gene Census is plotted for the 113 candidates.

B, C) for all three methods. We also looked at the cumula-
tive distribution of mutation prevalence in the COSMIC
database for all three datasets (Figure 2D, E, F). Through-
out the range of the top predictions output by DriverNet,
the concordance with CGC was always higher than for
Fisher and Frequency in the GBM2 and TN2 datasets. For
HGS2, DriverNet and the Frequency approach outper-
formed the Fisher method. The cumulative prevalence in
the COSMIC dataset was higher for DriverNet compared
to the other two approaches throughout the range of the
top predictions, with Frequency second best. Thus, far
fewer predictions are required by DriverNet to capture the
majority of drivers in the dataset, indicating higher relative
specificity.

For GBM2 (mutations only), the Frequency method
identified eight genes: EGFR, IDH1, NF1, PIK3R1, PTEN,
RB1, TP53, and FKBP9 as significantly altered with seven
of these found in CGC (Additional file 3). In total, Driver-
Net identified 34 genes (p < 0.05) including seven of the
genes nominated by the Frequency-based approach (Addi-
tional file 4). Several genes found in CGC (PIK3C2G,

MDM2, BCR, ERBB2, DDIT3, FGFR1, BRCA2, MET, and
PDGFRA) were also among the top 34 genes nominated
by DriverNet. We detected MET as the 29th ranked gene
(p = 0.002, mutated in three cases), which was reported in
[1], suggesting that it has been overlooked by the Fre-
quency method, which ranked this gene as the 93rd.

For TN2 (mutation only, no copy number), the Fre-
quency method identified five genes: PIK3CA, RB1, TP53,
PTEN, andMYO3A as significantly altered genes by muta-
tion, of which four were found in CGC (Additional file 5).
In total, DriverNet identified 59 genes with p < 0.05, four
of which were nominated by the Frequency-based
approach (Additional file 6). A DriverNet prediction not
identified by the Frequency approach included JAK1 (p =
0, ranked 13th, mutated in one case), which plays a key
role in prolactin signaling, which is implicated in breast
cancer [23,24].

For HGS2 (mutation only, no copy number), the Fre-
quency method identified CSMD3, BRCA1, BRCA2, and
TP53 as significantly altered genes, three of which were
found in CGC (Additional file 7). DriverNet identified

BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 in addition to CGC genes,
KRAS, PTEN, KIT, NRAS, RPN1, RB1, PIK3CA, CLTCL1,
ATIC, CREBBP, MET, PPP2R1A, CLTC, CTNNB1, BRAF,
and TSHR (Additional file 8). BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, and
NRAS are known oncogenic drivers and emphasize the
power of integration of expression data to nominate
important but infrequently mutated genes. In addition,
the known tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, was among
the top genes in DriverNet (rank 11th) but was over-
looked by the Frequency method, which ranked this gene
as 525th.

Infrequent mutations modulating transcriptional networks
feature prominently in population level datasets
We then sought to ascertain the prevalence of rare dri-
vers in all four datasets overlooked by Frequency-based
approach to driver prediction. We identified ‘infrequent’
significant drivers (p < 0.05) where the gene of interest
was abrogated by mutation or copy number alteration
(CNA) in < 2% of cases. Due to unknown ground truth
with respect to actual drivers, we restrict presentation to
those genes also found in the CGC. This resulted in 22
genes in METABRIC, 13 genes in HGS, 1 gene in TN,
and 2 genes in GBM (Table 2). The infrequent drivers in
METABRIC were PTEN, RB1, MDM2, MYC, CDKN2A,
CLTC, CREBBP, GNAS, EGFR, CCNE1, EP300, CBL,
PIK3R1, JAK2, TP53, NUP98, PIK3CA, IDH2, KRAS, and
TRA@. Both PIK3CA (two cases with high-level amplifi-
cations) and PIK3R1 (two cases with homozygous dele-
tions) were altered in 0.19% of cases, and yet showed
evidence of driving expression levels of the connected
genes to the tails of the expression distribution. Interest-
ingly, we identified seven cases (0.67%) with homozygous
deletions in TP53 (locus 17p13.1) coincident with outly-
ing expression in MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways
(Additional files 9 and 10). Loss of function of TP53
is typically associated with mutation; however, these
results suggest that in rare cases, homozygous deletions
may be the mechanism by which TP53 is lost in breast
cancer.

In HGS, we found 13 genes that were infrequent drivers
also found in CGC (AKT2, KIT, NRAS, RPN, PIK3CA,
CREBBP, PPP2R1A, ATIC, CLTCL1, MET, MAP2K4,
ETV1, and EP300) (Table 2). Intriguingly, KIT (1.97% of
cases) and NRAS (0.66% of cases) were detected as drivers
(p = 2E-4 and 9E-4, respectively; Additional files 11 and
12) where KIT is mutated in melanomas, gastrointestinal
stromal tumors, adult acute myeloid leukemia patients,
and many other tumor types at high frequency and is the
target of the kinase inhibitor Imatinib. The mutations in
NRAS (typically associated with melanomas, multiple mye-
lomas, acute myelogenous leukemia, and thyroid cancer)
were, in both cases, the Q61R hotspot mutation in the

Ras domain. Both the KIT and NRAS mutations were
overlooked as driver mutations by the Frequency-based
approach (Additional file 7). This illustrates the increased
sensitivity of DriverNet in identifying infrequent drivers in
the population. Interestingly, mutations typically asso-
ciated with lower grade (Type I) ovarian cancers such as
PIK3CA (0.66% cases mutated) and CTNNB1 (0.6% cases
mutated) were also nominated as drivers despite having
extremely low frequency. The two PIK3CA mutations
were both in well-known, activating hotspots, E545K and
H1047R. We suggest that these (four separate) cases
might actually be histologically misdiagnosed ovarian can-
cers. These cases represent an important anecdote as
many tumor populations contain rare mutations that cre-
ate aberrant expression profiles. Type I ovarian cancers
exhibit considerably different expression profiles com-
pared to Type II high-grade serous cancers [25]. If indeed
these cases are non-serous it would be unsurprising, given
the DriverNet formulation of integration of genomic and
transcriptomic profiles, that these rare mutations would
cover many outlier events. In addition, we note that the
previously mentioned MAP2K4 as an infrequent driver
with a mutation in one case and homozygous deletions in
two cases, and the presence of ETV1, typically known for
gene fusions, are listed amongst the infrequent drivers in
the HGS ovarian data. Finally, we cross-referenced the list
of genes p < 0.05 with Cheung et al. [26] (a list of genes
with genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cell lines) and noted
that ALG8 and CCNE1 overlapped.

In the TN and GBM datasets, results were sparser. In
the TN dataset, only one gene was an infrequent driver
that was also in CGC: JAK1 with a mutation occurring in
a single case (Table 2). JAK1 associated outliers were
enriched for EGFR1 signaling (Additional files 13 and 14),
suggesting that the mutation has downstream effects on
an important oncogenic signaling network. In the GBM
dataset, two genes, namely KRAS and AKT1, were infre-
quent drivers and were also found in CGC. KRAS asso-
ciated outliers were enriched for MAPK and PDGFR
signaling and AKT1 outliers were enriched for FoxO
family signaling (Additional files 15 and 16). AKT activa-
tion is associated with many malignancies, where AKT
acts, in part, by inhibiting FoxO tumor suppressors [27].
Collectively, investigations of rare drivers in METABRIC,
HGS, TN, and GBM point out bona fide, but rare driver
mutations, which would likely be omitted by methods
examining genomic aberrations by selection or frequency
analysis. These results indicate that rare driver mutations
modulating expression networks comprise a meaningful
component of the landscape of transcriptional variation
attributed to the somatic genome, and thus should not be
overlooked in the comprehensive enumeration of driver
mutations in population-level studies.

Genomic copy number changes harboring known
oncogenes simultaneously modulate metabolic pathways
We next examined patterns of modulated expression asso-
ciated with drivers occurring within the same high-level
amplification or homozygous deletion. Surprisingly, we
noted four examples in the METABRIC and GBM data-
sets whereby genes proximal to known drivers and within
the same genomic copy number change exhibited evidence
for altering the expression of metabolic pathways exclusive
of known oncogenic or tumor suppressor pathway modu-
lation (Figure 3). PNMT encodes the phenylethanolamine
N-methyltransferase enzyme and resides approximately

20 Kb centromeric to ERBB2 with one intervening gene.
ERBB2, amplified in approximately 15-20% of breast can-
cers,
is a well-known, targetable membrane-bound
growth-factor receptor that is effectively inhibited by tras-
tuzumab in clinical practice. The proximity of PNMT to
ERBB2 results in co-amplification of both genes in nearly
all cases (82/83 cases with high-level amplification of
ERBB2 (Additional file 10)). PNMT was the top ranked
driver in our analysis (ERBB2 was rank 3). When we
examined the outlier genes associated with ERBB2 and
PNMT, ERBB2-associated outlier genes were, as expected,
enriched for Erbb signaling and EGF signaling pathways.

Figure 3 Simultaneous modulation of metabolic pathways in copy number alterations harboring known oncogenes. EnrichmentMap
[32] diagrams depicting Reactome pathways enriched in the set of outliers associated with pairs of genes that are co-amplified or co-deleted. In
each pair, one gene is a known tumor suppressor or oncogene while the other is a metabolism gene. Pathways are shown as connected nodes
in a graph where the size of the node indicates the number of genes in the pathway. Edges between nodes indicate genes common to both
pathways where the thickness of the edge represents the degree of overlap. In general, little overlap was observed between metabolic drivers
and oncogenic/tumor-suppressor drivers. (A) PNMT and ERBB2 co-amplified genes at the chr17q12 locus in breast cancer. (B) PAK1 and NDUFC2
co-amplified genes at the 11q14 locus in breast cancer. (C) CDKN2A and MTAP co-deleted genes at chr9p21.3 in GBM.

PNMT-associated outliers were enriched for non-onco-
genic macromolecule biosynthesis pathways including
metabolic pathways and tyrosine metabolism (Figure 3A).
The co-occurring modulation of oncogenic and metabolic
pathways was also found in other high-level amplifications
in METABRIC including the 11q14 amplification of PAK1
and NDUFC2 (Additional file 10). PAK1 (27 cases with
high-level amplifications) shows evidence of driving EGFR
signaling (Figure 3B) and importantly segregates with a
poor outcome ER positive subtype as reported in [20].
NDUFC2 (30 cases with high-level amplifications), down-
stream of PAK1 by approximately 660 Kb, encodes an
NADH dehydrogenase enzyme. Outliers associated with
NDUFC2 were associated with metabolic pathways and an
oxidative phosphorylation pathway: a metabolic pathway
that uses energy released by the oxidation of nutrients to
produce adenosine triphosphate (Figure 3B).

A similar pattern of simultaneous modulation of meta-
bolic pathways by the copy number changes harboring
known oncogenes was observed in GBM data. The cyclin-
dependent kinase CDKN2A and the methylthioadenosine
phosphorylase MTAP are separated by approximately 100
Kb and are adjacent genes. MTAP (DriverNet rank 3) and
known tumor-suppressor CDKN2A (DriverNet rank 4) are
known to be co-deleted and they were observed as such in
our analysis. We observed 53 cases with homozygous dele-
tions in CDK2NA with accompanying co-deletion of
MTAP in all cases (Additional file 16). In two additional
cases with CDKN2A point mutations, MTAP was not

found to be mutated or deleted. The enriched pathways of
the CDK2NA-associated outliers included cell cycle, p53
signaling, and the FOXM1 transcription factor network
amongst others. The only significant enriched pathway of
MTAP-deletion associated outliers was the metabolic
pathway (Figure 3C).

We examined PNMT-, NDUFC2-, and MTAP-associated
outlying genes that were part of metabolic pathways and
also ERBB2-, PAK1-, and CDKN2A-associated outlying
genes that were related to the oncogenic/tumor suppressor
pathways. Outlying genes related to metabolic pathways
and oncogenic/tumor suppressor pathways were distribu-
ted across disparate loci in the genome eliminating co-
amplification as the cause for the observed signals (Addi-
tional file 17).

The results of metabolic genes being co-aberrated with
oncogenic and tumor suppressor genes suggest strongly
that at least a portion of metabolic pathway disruption in
cancer can be mechanistically attributed to somatic aberra-
tions in the genome. Moreover, our results indicate the
intriguing possibility that genomic aberrations harboring
known oncogenic/tumor suppressor drivers are being
selected for due to oncogenic pathway modulation coupled
with non-overlapping metabolic pathway modulation.

Discussion
A major challenge in large-scale interrogation of genomic
and transcriptomic profiles of tumor types is to contex-
tualize genomic aberrations within their gene expression

profiles. Assessing the impact of a somatic mutation on
the expression networks of a tumor provides strong evi-
dence for its status as a driver. We presented a novel
algorithm called DriverNet for integrative analysis of
genomic and transcriptomic data derived from popula-
tion-level studies of tumors. DriverNet associates the pre-
sence of a mutated gene with its impact on the gene
expression levels of its known interacting partners. We
showed in several cancer datasets that this approach is
both sensitive and specific with respect to known driver
genes and is suitable for application in population-level
datasets for numerous tumor types that will rapidly
emerge in the coming years.

Investigation of infrequent drivers revealed a surpris-
ing number of rare mutations in known cancer genes
typically associated with other cancers. Although infre-
quent, they nonetheless modulate the expression profiles
and their identification is critical to understanding the
pathogenesis of the cancers that harbor them. We sug-
gest that examination of genomic patterns in the popu-
lation without the integration of the transcriptome
would likely result in overlooking these important, but
rare drivers. The structure of the bipartite graph induces
an interplay between the influence graph, the frequency
of mutations, and the frequency of aberrant expression.
A natural question that arises is the role of both fre-
quency of mutation and node degree in the ranking of
the output. Additional files 18 and 19 show that while
rank is correlated with both frequency and node degree,
the relationship is not monotonic and therefore the
structure of the graph does not deterministically order
the output. This suggests instead that simultaneous
observations in the genome and the transcriptome in
many cases override the structure induced by the influ-
ence graph and mutation frequency and can therefore
penetrate the seemingly deterministic structure induced
by the initial bipartite graph.

Finally, we describe a set of aberrations whereby prox-
imal drivers appear to simultaneously modulate onco-
genic and metabolic pathways. This was observed in
both breast cancer and GBM datasets and leaves open
the possibility that selection of well-known drivers such
as ERBB2 and EGFR may be synergistically acting on
altered metabolic processes abrogated by co-altered,
nearby metabolism genes. In light of recent renewed
interest in studying altered metabolism in cancer [28]
owing to IDH1/2 somatic mutations in AML and GBM,
the compound effects of single genomic events on meta-
bolic and oncogenic pathways, suggest that disruption of
metabolic pathways by somatic mutations may be more
widespread than previously thought and provides an
impetus for novel therapies that might restore normal
metabolic function in a cancer-cell specific manner.

Limitations
The DriverNet algorithm has some limitations. As outly-
ing expression is computed in a deterministic manner,
we may not be capturing less extreme but nonetheless
important changes in expression that are modulated by
a genomic event. Furthermore, DriverNet does not
gracefully handle the directionality of the expression
change. A probabilistic model would account for the
subtler changes in expression handling; however, the
combinatorial complexity of inference required in a fully
probabilistic framework remains a daunting and unre-
solved challenge because of the number of parameters
to estimate. Thus, this remains an open problem. In
addition, DriverNet relies on the genomic aberrations
including mutations and extreme copy number altera-
tion events that are supplied to the algorithm. The
threshold to determine what constitutes a significant
copy number alteration lies within third-party copy
number analysis algorithms and can affect DriverNet
results. Performance benchmarking suggest that, in
most cases, DriverNet performs better when only
extreme copy number alterations, that is, high-level
amplifications and homozygous deletions, were included
in the analysis (Additional file 20). Reducing the thresh-
olds to detect more copy number alterations (such as
chromosome-arm level events) results in too large a
space of altered genes in a given dataset (Additional files
21, 22, 23, 24).

The DriverNet framework relies on a predetermined
influence graph that is undoubtedly sparse and incom-
plete. This is underscored by the omission in the
METABRIC dataset of ZNF703, which resides in the
amplification of the 8p12 locus that includes FGFR1.
We have recently described ZNF703 as a driver [29] in
luminal B cancers; however, DriverNet was not posi-
tioned to identify it due to its absence in the Reactome
database. There are undoubtedly other false negative
predictions due to poor characterization and lack of
protein-protein interaction data; however, as interaction
databases increase in density and volume of interactions,
the DriverNet framework will be well placed to leverage
such improvements. Nevertheless, our goal is not to dis-
cover new protein interactions in this work, but rather
to describe the association of mutations and expression
in the context of well-understood knowledge bases.
Finally, we note that this framework is suitable for data-
sets with many patients sequenced. Ultimately, we wish
to extend the framework for application to individual
patients to determine the effectiveness of identification
of actionable driver mutations for clinical use. This will
require the accumulation of large gene expression repo-
sitories for tumor types that can be used to contextua-
lize a patient’s expression and mutational profiles.

Conclusions
We have presented a comprehensive analysis from four
independent datasets of how transcriptional networks are
affected by genomic aberrations in cancer and demonstrate
how integrative analysis can be used effectively to identify
novel driver genes in population-level studies of tumor
genomes and transcriptomes. Our results demonstrate the
power of integrative analysis across multiple tumor types
in recently generated population-scale datasets in revealing
infrequent, but functionally important, mutations and
novel patterns of pathway disruption in cancer. We expect
DriverNet to generalize well to planned future studies,
including application to patient-specific mutational and
expression profiles for genome/transcriptome-informed
personalized cancer care.

Methods
In this section we present the essential details of the
DriverNet algorithm. Additional details of data analysis,
data preprocessing, and the Fisher method are presented
in Additional file 1.

Details of DriverNet algorithm
Consider two gene-patient matrices. The first matrix M(i, j)
represents a binary matrix where M(i, j) = 1 indicates gene
i is mutated in patient j and M(i, j) = 0 indicates the
absence of a mutation. Mutations can take the form of
somatic point mutations, indels, copy number changes, or
possibly epigenomic events. Matrix G(i, j) captures the
real-valued gene expression measure of gene i in patient j
and can be derived from gene expression arrays or RNA-
Seq. Optionally, G(i, j) can be transformed into a matrix
G’(i, j) indicating whether gene i in patient j is an outlier
from the population-level distribution for that gene. Given
these matrices, we can formulate the problem of finding
driver mutations with a bipartite graph,
(Figure 1C),
where nodes on the left represent genomic aberration sta-
tus from M (green nodes show the genes that have a muta-
tion in at least one patient) and nodes on the right are
patient-gene events from G or G’ (for every patient, outliers
are shown as red nodes). Edges are drawn between nodes
in different partitions of the graph under the following con-
ditions: for each patient pk draw an edge between nodes gi
in the left partition and gj for patient pk in the right parti-
tion, if gi is mutated, gj exhibits outlying expression, and gi
and gj interact according to known gene networks (for
example, Reactome FI [30]), termed the influence graph
after [18].

The aim of the inference algorithm is to identify genes
in the left partition that are connected to the most nodes
in the right partition (for example, g2 as shown in Figure
1C), thereby identifying mutated genes with the largest
extent of transcriptional disruption, and simultaneously

implicating a network of connected genes in the influ-
ence graph with outlying expression that associate with
the mutation. The genes are ranked according to their
node coverage in the bipartite graph,
. If we denote the
set of all the mutated genes by U, we postulate that the
top n driver geneset Dn ⊆ U is the set of n genes that
cover the maximum number of nodes on the right parti-
tion of the bipartite graph. It should be noted that: i) due
to different factors, all the outlying expression events
may not be explained by the given mutations; and ii) the
algorithm formulation makes the strong assumption that
drivers will modulate the expression of many genes,
which will primarily apply for genes that alter large, well-
defined transcriptional networks. Finally, we observe that
solving this problem is closely related to the minimum
set cover problem, which is NP-hard.

A greedy approximation algorithm to solve the
optimization problem
Given a set of elements (called the universe) and some
sets whose union comprises the universe, the set cover
problem is to identify the smallest number of sets whose
union still contains all elements in the universe. The ana-
logy of the minimum set cover problem to our driver
mutation framework is as follows: i) elements of the uni-
verse are the patient-gene (outlying expression) events,
and ii) each mutation corresponds to a set that consists
of those patient-gene events connected to this mutation
in the bipartite graph. The greedy algorithm for our pro-
blem is similar to that for the set cover problem: at each
stage, choose a mutated gene that contains the largest
number of uncovered outlying expression events (see
Algorithm 1). The stopping condition is when all the
connected outlying expression events are covered. In
other words, the algorithm looks for the minimum cover-
ing for all of the elements in the universe. It can be
shown that the greedy algorithm achieves an approxima-
tion ratio of H(s), where s is the size of the largest set and
H(n) =

n
k=1 1/k is the nth harmonic number.

Significance tests
The statistical significance of the driver genes are assessed
using a randomization framework. The original datasets
are permuted N = 500 times, and the algorithm is run on
the N randomly generated datasets and results on real
data are assessed to see if they are significantly different
from the results on randomized datasets. This is an indir-
ect way of perturbing the bipartite graph corresponding to
the original problem. To generate the random datasets, we
permute both the patient-mutation, M , and patient-out-
lier, G’, matrices according to the following procedure:
i) construct a J × K zero matrix where J represents the
number of patients and K represents the total number of

domly selected cells, where Ntotal represents either the

the columns where their elements are 0. Using the same
influence graph, the algorithm is run on the N = 500 per-
muted patient-mutation, M1... MN, and patient-outlier,
G1’... GN’, matrices.

Suppose D is the result of the driver mutation discovery
algorithm. D contains a ranked list of driver genes with
their corresponding node coverage in the bipartite graph,
. The statistical significance of a gene g ÎD with a corre-
sponding node coverage, COVg, is the fraction of times
that we observe driver genes with the node coverage of
more than COVg in the N = 500 random runs of the algo-
rithm:

pvalue(g) =

N(cid:2)

where Si is the number of drivers identified in the ith
run of the algorithm. We then use the Benjamini-Hoch-
berg approach for correcting the P values for multiple
tests.

Building the influence graph
The influence graph captures the knowledge about the
influence of mutation in a gene on the change of expres-
sion of another gene. Various sources of information such
as the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks or net-
works based on copy number and/or expression data can
be used to build the influence graph. In this paper, we uti-
lize the protein functional interaction network derived in
[30] to build the influence graph. This network extends

the protein functional interaction network in curated path-
ways with non-curated sources of information, including
protein-protein interactions, gene co-expression, protein
domain interaction, gene ontology (GO) annotations, and
text-mined protein interactions, which cover close to 50%
of the human proteome.

Implementation
The DriverNet algorithm is implemented in a publicly
available R package [31]. The memory complexity of the
greedy algorithm is O(M N + M R + R2), where M is the
number of patients, N is the number of mutated genes,
and R is the number of genes with gene expression values
and also in the influence graph. The algorithm needs
memory to hold the patient-mutation matrix, the patient-
outlier matrix, and the influence graph. Note that all the
three matrices are sparse binary matrices, thus the mem-
ory usage can be decreased by using sparse representation
of the matrices. If we rank all the mutated genes, the time
complexity is O(δ × N (N + 1)/2), where δ is the time used
to compute the explained outliers by a gene, which is
bounded by its node degree of the influence graph. In
practice, the algorithm is fast when the memory usage
is low. For example, for the GBM dataset, it takes about
1 minute to run on a dual-core desktop Mac computer
without computing the empirical P values.
