Abstract

Whereas carcinogenesis requires the acquisition of driver muta-
tions in progenitor cells, tumor growth and progression are heavily
inÔ¨Çuenced by the local microenvironment. Previous studies from our
laboratory have used NeuroÔ¨Åbromatosis-1 (NF1) genetically engi-
neered mice to characterize the role of stromal cells and signals to
optic glioma formation and growth. Previously, we have shown that
Nf1+/j microglia in the tumor microenvironment are critical cellu-
lar determinants of optic glioma proliferation. To deÔ¨Åne the role of
microglia in tumor formation and maintenance further, we used
in which resident brain microglia (CD11b+,
CD11b-TK mice,
CD68+, Iba1+, CD45low cells) can be ablated at speciÔ¨Åc times after
ganciclovir administration. Ganciclovir-mediated microglia reduc-
tion reduced Nf1 optic glioma proliferation during both tumor
maintenance and tumor development. We identiÔ¨Åed the devel-
opmental window during which microglia are increased in the
Nf1+/j optic nerve and demonstrated that this accumulation re-
Ô¨Çected delayed microglia dispersion. The increase in microglia in
the Nf1+/j optic nerve was associated with reduced expression of
the chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, such that reduced Cx3cr1 ex-
pression in Cx3cr1-GFP heterozygous knockout mice led to a
similar increase in optic nerve microglia. These results establish a
critical role for microglia in the development and maintenance
of Nf1 optic glioma.

INTRODUCTION
that

The concept

the tumor microenvironment plays
instructive roles in oncogenesis and cancer growth has gained
considerable traction during the past 10 years (1). In other
cancers, stroma-tumor interactions involve immune system cells
(leukocytes, mast cells, and macrophages) and Ô¨Åbroblasts, which
secrete extracellular proteins, cytokines, and growth factors
(2Y5). Unlike other cancers, Ô¨Åbroblasts and mast cells are not
relevant stromal cell types in brain tumors (gliomas), suggesting
that other cell types may contribute to microenvironmental in-
Ô¨Çuences on central nervous system (CNS) tumorigenesis and
growth. Moreover, the stromal signals that inÔ¨Çuence glioma
formation and growth are likely distinct from those implicated
in non-CNS cancers and may be regulated in spatial and tem-
poral patterns during postnatal brain development.

Previous studies from our laboratory have used Nf1
genetically engineered mouse (GEM) strains to deÔ¨Åne the
role of the tumor microenvironment in glioma formation and
growth. NeuroÔ¨Åbromatosis-1 is a common tumor predis-
position syndrome in which children are prone to the devel-
opment of low-grade glial cell neoplasms (gliomas) along
the optic pathway (optic pathway gliomas). These low-grade
gliomas are classiÔ¨Åed as World Health Organization (WHO)
grade 1 pilocytic astrocytomas and are typically found in the
optic nerve and chiasm of children younger than 7 years (6).
Children with NF1 are born with 1 nonfunctional copy of
the NF1 gene in all cells of their body (NF1 heterozygosity;
NF1+/j) but develop gliomas only upon loss of the one re-
maining functional allele in glial progenitor cells. To model
this genetic condition in mice, we previously generated
mice with Nf1 inactivation in glial progenitors; however,
none of these mice developed gliomas (7). In contrast, glioma
formation was only observed in Nf1+/j mice with glial cell
Nf1 inactivation, thus establishing an absolute requirement
for Nf1 heterozygosity in glioma formation (8). The obser-
vation that Nf1 loss in glial progenitors is necessary, but not
sufÔ¨Åcient, for tumorigenesis supported the hypothesis that
nonneoplastic Nf1+/j cells provide a permissive environment
required for glioma formation. By leveraging Nf1 GEM strains
with highly penetrant tumor phenotypes, we showed that mi-
croglia represented one of the critical cell types present in
the tumor microenvironment of Nf1 optic glioma mice (9).

Microglia have long been recognized as a major cel-
lular constituent of the glioma microenvironment (10Y13).

Rio-Hortega and Asua (14) Ô¨Årst identiÔ¨Åed microglia in brain
tumors in 1921; however, their role in glioma formation and
continued growth (maintenance) remains unclear. In this re-
gard, microglia may have antitumor activity (15, 16) or promote
glioma growth by producing cytokines, such as interleukins 1
and 10, basic Ô¨Åbroblast growth factor, and transforming growth
factor A (17Y19). To deÔ¨Åne the role of microglia in glioma
growth, we previously used 2 independent approaches to
microglia inactivation in Nf1 GEM optic gliomas. First, using
minocycline to inactivate microglia in 10- to 12-week-old Nf1
optic glioma mice, we found that reduced microglia activation,
as assessed by morphological change, reduced tumor pro-
liferation (20). Second, we identiÔ¨Åed that Nf1+/j microglia, but
not Nf1-deÔ¨Åcient astroglial cells, exhibited hyperactivation of
c-Jun-NH2 kinase (JNK) such that treatment of Nf1 optic
glioma mice with a relatively nonselective pharmacologic JNK
inhibitor attenuated tumor proliferation (21). These proof-of-
principle experiments demonstrated that Nf1+/j microglia
inactivation decreased Nf1 optic glioma proliferation in vivo,
but the inhibitors used in these studies did not directly target
microglia and may have had additional effects. Moreover, these
studies did not address the importance of microglia during Nf1
optic glioma development.

In the current study, we use a novel CD11b-TK trans-
genic mouse strain to ablate microglia genetically and dem-
onstrate that microglia are important stromal cell types during
gliomagenesis (tumor development) and for glioma mainte-
nance. In addition, we deÔ¨Åne a spatially and temporally re-
stricted window in which increased numbers of microglia are
present in the Nf1+/j optic nerve. We further demonstrate that
this increase in microglia likely reÔ¨Çects impaired microglial
dispersal during postnatal optic nerve development as a result
of reduced CX3CR1 expression. Collectively, these Ô¨Åndings
establish a critical role for microglia in promoting tumor
proliferation throughout gliomagenesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mouse and Human Specimens

Mice were used in accordance to established Animal
Studies Protocols at the Washington University School of
Medicine. Nf1f lox/j; GFAP-Cre (Nf1+/jGFAPCKO), Nf1f lox/j;
GFAP-Cre; CD11b-TK (Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK), CD11b-TK
(22), Cx3cr1+/GFP (23), Nf1+/j; Cx3cr1+/GFP, wild-type
(WT), and Nf1+/j mice were all maintained on a C57BL/6
background. The Nf1+/jGFAPCKO optic gliomas lack the
Rosenthal Ô¨Åbers and eosinophilic granular bodies that are
characteristic of human pilocytic astrocytomas but otherwise
closely resemble pediatric low-grade gliomas based on the
presence of discrete optic nerve/chiasm masses composed
of hyperproliferating astrocytes with large hyperchromatic
nuclei, low proliferative indices, new blood vessel formation,
microglia inÔ¨Åltration, Olig2-immunoreactive cells, and contrast
enhancement on small-animal magnetic resonance imaging (8);
there is no evidence of endothelial hyperplasia or necrosis.

Human tumor specimens were used in accordance with
established guidelines under an active and approved human
studies protocol. Human glioma specimens were studied

using 2 individual tissue microarrays developed at the Mayo
Clinic Foundation and Washington University School of
Medicine, as previously reported (24, 25). Nonneoplastic
human brain samples from the neocortex were obtained from
autopsy materials acquired under an approved human studies
protocol at the Washington University School of Medicine.

Immunohistochemistry

-

Mice were perfused transcardially with 4% parafor-
maldehyde in 0.1 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
Optic nerves and optic chiasms were dissected and postÔ¨Åxed
in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4
C. All specimens were
then processed for parafÔ¨Ån embedding and sectioning at the
Ophthalmology Histology Core or the Histology and Micro-
scopy Core at Washington University School of Medicine.
Slides were deparafÔ¨Ånized in xylene and subjected to antigen
retrieval. After the washing and blocking steps, sections were
incubated overnight with rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:3000; Wako,
Richmond, VA), mouse anti-Ki67 (1:500; BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA), or rat anti-CD34 (1:50; BD Biosciences) fol-
lowed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies
(1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at room temper-
ature (RT) for 1 hour. Immunoreactivity was visualized with
the Vectastain ABC system and 3,3¬∂-diaminobenzidine, Vector
NovaRED, or Vector SG (Vector Laboratories).

All sections were photographed using a digital camera
attached to a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon Instru-
ments Inc., Melville, NY). For each optic nerve counted, 3
photographs were taken at a magniÔ¨Åcation of 10 for at least
4 mice/group, including the optic chiasm and the right or left
optic nerve just anterior to the chiasm (Figure, Supplemental
Digital Content 1, part A, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A199).
For brainstem and neocortex regions, 4 photographs
were taken at a magniÔ¨Åcation of 10 for at least 4 mice/
group (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1, parts B, C,
http://links.lww.com/NEN/A199). The total number of Iba1+
cells was quantitated in the mouse prechiasmatic optic nerves,
chiasm, brainstem, and neocortex, as previously described,
with the investigator blinded to the genotype and treatment
(26). All Iba1+ cells were counted regardless of morphology
(amoeboid vs ramiÔ¨Åed). In the human tumors, the number of
Iba1+ cells was calculated as a percentage of the total number
of nucleated cells.

and followed by incubation with Ô¨Çuorescent secondary anti-
bodies (1:200 goat anti-rat A488, goat anti-rabbit A568, or
goat antimouse A488; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hour
at RT. In all cases, no speciÔ¨Åc immunostaining was observed
in the negative control samples. Images were acquired using
an Olympus multichannel confocal microscope (Olympus
America Inc., Center Valley, PA) in the Washington University
Bakewell Neuroimaging Core Facility, and Image J image
analysis software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/; Wayne Rasband,
National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD) was used
to obtain a single collapsed image from an optical stack.

Ganciclovir Treatment

Ganciclovir (GCV; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was
dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and adminis-
tered at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. For the experiments focused
on determining the acute effects of microglia ablation on optic
glioma proliferation, Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK mice were divided
into 2 groups: one group received daily intraperitoneal GCV
injections for 2 weeks starting at 3 weeks or 3 months, whereas
the other group received daily intraperitoneal injections of
vehicle (PBS) starting at 3 weeks or 3 months.

Flow Cytometry

Microglia from mice were collected using previously
described procedures with minor modiÔ¨Åcations (27). BrieÔ¨Çy,
for each experiment, optic nerves and chiasms harvested
from 7 to 10 mice, transcardially perfused with Ringer‚Äôs sol-
ution, were homogenized through a 70-Km nylon Ô¨Ålter (Fisher
ScientiÔ¨Åc), enzymatically digested in Hanks‚Äô buffered salt
solution without calcium and magnesium containing 0.05%
collagenase I (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 Kg/mL N>-tosyl-L-lysine
chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride (TLCK; Sigma-Aldrich),
0.01 mg/mL bovine deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I; Sigma-
Aldrich), 10 mmol/L HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 hour at RT,
and Ô¨Åltered through a 40-Km nylon Ô¨Ålter (Fisher ScientiÔ¨Åc).
Brainstem specimens were similarly processed to obtain cells
for Ô¨Çow cytometry controls. A discontinuous Percoll gradient
(Amersham/GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) of 30%, 37%, and
70% allowed for collection of an enriched macrophage and
microglia sample from the 37% to 70% interface. Alternately,
magnetic cell sorting using CD11b microbeads after myelin
removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) was
used to extract the CD11b+ microglia population. After Fc
blocking with a CD16/32 antibody (BD Biosciences), cell
surface staining was performed with antiYCD45-APC (30-F11;
BD Biosciences) and antiYCD11b-PerCP-Cy5.5 antibodies.
In some experiments, cells were Ô¨Åxed and permeabilized with
the BD CytoÔ¨Åx/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD
Biosciences) and then stained with CD68-R-PE (FA-11; AbD
Serotec, Oxford, UK) or rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako) conjugated to
R-PE using the Zenon Rabbit IgG Labeling Kit (Molecular
Probes,
Isotype and Ô¨Çuorescence minus one
(FMO) controls were used to determine nonspeciÔ¨Åc staining.
Flow cytometry data were collected on a BD FACScan Ô¨Çow
cytometer retroÔ¨Åtted with a second laser (Cytek, Fremont, CA)
using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and Rainbow software
(Cytek) in the High-Speed Cell Sorter Core Facility at the

Invitrogen).

Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, and data were
subsequently analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland,
OR). Viable cells were gated by Forward Scatter (FSC) and
Side Scatter (SSC) characteristics, and the appropriate controls
were used for compensation and to determine negatively and
positively stained populations, as previously described (28).

Quantitative Reverse TranscriptionYPolymerase
Chain Reaction

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (quantitative PCR,
qPCR) was performed using SYBR Green detection accord-
ing to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Total RNA was extracted
from Nf1+/j and WT optic nerve using TRIzol. Complemen-
tary DNA was synthesized from total RNA samples using the
Ominiscript kit (Qiagen, Alameda, CA). AmpliÔ¨Åcation was per-
formed in 96-well plates in a real-time sequence detection sys-
tem instrument (CFX96 Real-Time System; Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Primer sequences for Cx3cr1 were 5¬∂-AGGCCTGT
_
TATTTGGGCGACAT-3¬∂ (forward) and 5
AGCGAGGACCA
CCAACAGATTT-3¬∂ (reverse). Primer sequences for Cx3cl1
were 5¬∂-AAATGGGTCCAAGACGCCATGA-3¬∂ (forward) and
5¬∂-ACATTGTCCACCCGCTTCTCAA-3¬∂
(reverse). Bio-Rad
CFX Manager software was used to convert the Ô¨Çuorescent
data into cycle threshold (CT) measurements. The $$CT
method was used to calculate changes in fold expression rela-
tive to WT optic nerve using A-actin as an internal control.
Statistical Analyses

Student t tests, along with Grubbs test to determine
outliers, were performed for all statistical analyses. Mean and
SEM were used for all graphs. For all experiments involving
cell quantitation, the investigators were blinded to mouse
genotype and treatment.

RESULTS

Increased Microglia in NF1-Associated
Pilocytic Astrocytomas

Several previous studies have reported increased num-
bers of microglia in human gliomas, constituting as many as
a third of all cells in glioma biopsies (10Y13). We also found
a 2-fold increase in the percentage of Iba1-postive cells
(microglia) in high-grade human astrocytomas (Figs. 1A, B).
Previous studies have suggested that Iba1 is a more selective
marker of brain microglia in both human (29) and rodent
tissues (30). By contrast, anti-CD68 antibodies label resident
brain microglia (CD68+, CD11b+, CD45low cells), (31, 32),
lymphocytes (CD68+, CD11b+/j, CD45high) (33, 34), neu-
trophils (CD68+, CD11b+, CD45high)
(35, 36), dendritic
cells (CD68+, CD11b+, CD45high cells) (37, 38), and bone
marrowYderived monocytes (CD68+, CD11b+, CD45high
cells) (32, 39). Similar percentages of microglia were gen-
erally found in WHO grade 1 low-grade gliomas as in the
high-grade tumors, but NF1-associated pilocytic astrocytomas
(NF1-PA) had higher percentages of microglia than their
sporadic counterparts (SP-PA) (p = 0.0008) (Figs. 1A, C).

Because previous reports used CD68 as a marker for
microglia in brain tumors (40, 41), we analyzed numbers of
CD68+ cells in the PA tumors. There was a trend toward

chemistry demonstrates increased percentages of microglia in anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) (p = 0.0236) and glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) tumors (p = 0.0377) versus nonneoplastic brain (NB). (C) Sporadic pilocytic astrocytomas (SP-PA) have a

increased numbers of CD68+ cells in NF1-PA tumors
versus both their sporadic counterparts and nonneoplastic
brain (NB) tissue, the results did not reach statistical signiÔ¨Å-
cance (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2, parts A, B,
http://links.lww.com/NEN/A200). We suspect the differences
between the results obtained using Iba1 and CD68 immuno-
staining reÔ¨Çects the labeling of blood-derived macrophages
and neutrophils by the anti-CD68 but not the Iba1 antibody.
We also observed stronger immunoreactivity with the Iba1
antibody in the formalin-Ô¨Åxed, parafÔ¨Ån-embedded speci-
mens. Moreover, in studies of CD68 and Iba1 colabeling in
areas of brain ischemia, numerous CD68+ cells lacked Iba1
colabeling and, therefore, likely represented bone marrowY
derived macrophages, leukocytes, neutrophils, or dendritic
cells (35, 39) (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2, part C,
http://links.lww.com/NEN/A200). The Ô¨Ånding of greater
numbers of Iba1+ microglia in NF1-PA than in SP-PA raised
suggested that these stromal cells play a particularly important
role in NF1-associated gliomas.

Genetic Ablation of Microglia in Established
Tumors Decreases Nf1 Mouse Optic
Glioma Proliferation

Our previous study on microglia in human pilocytic
astrocytomas suggested that
the number of microglia in
the tumors positively correlated with glioma proliferation
rate (42). We also previously showed that minocycline- or
JNK inhibitorYmediated microglia inactivation decreased
optic glioma tumor cell proliferation in vivo (20). However,
these pharmacologic approaches are limited by potential
off-target effects affecting other cell
types in the tumor
microenvironment and do not directly address the role of
microglia in tumor proliferation. To establish a more deÔ¨Ånitive
role for microglia in regulating Nf1 optic glioma proliferation
in Nf1+/jGFAPCKO mice at 3 months with radiographically
and histologically obvious tumors (glioma maintenance), we
used a novel transgenic mouse in which CD11b+ cells express
the thymidine kinase (TK) gene (22). On the administration
of GCV, CD11b+ cells are killed.

Microglia and Nf1 Glioma Growth

To characterize the CD11b+ population in the mouse
optic nerve and to determine whether the ablated CD11b+ cells
were primarily microglia, we performed Ô¨Çow cytometry and
immunohistochemistry studies using several established mono-
cyte markers. First, we found that CD11b and CD68 label the
same population of cells in the optic nerves of 6-week-old WT
mice (Fig. 2A). Most of this population expressed low levels
of CD45 characteristic of resident microglia (R1 = 95% of the
CD11b+ cell population) rather than high levels of CD45 in-
dicative of bone marrowYderived macrophages (Fig. 2B). Iba1
colabeled these CD11b+ cells, as determined by Ô¨Çow cytometry
(Fig. 2C) and Iba1/CD11b double labeling in optic nerve sec-
tions (Fig 2D). In both cases, more than 99% of the cells ana-
lyzed were positive for both CD11b and Iba1. Iba1+ cells also
express low levels of CD45 (Fig. 2E; R1 = 95% of Iba1+ cells),
consistent with their classiÔ¨Åcation as resident microglia.
Moreover, using CD11b magnetic bead capture of microglia
from optic gliomas of 3-month-old Nf1+/jGFAPCKO mice, most
of the CD11b+ population isolated had low CD45 expression
(Fig. 2F), thereby establishing that GCV/TKYmediated abla-
tion of CD11b+ cells in Nf1 mouse optic gliomas mainly targets
the resident microglia population.

On the basis of

these Ô¨Åndings, we intercrossed
CD11b-TK mice with our Nf1+/jGFAPCKO mice to generate
Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK mice and injected GCV intraperitoneally
daily for 2 weeks into 3-month-old Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK
mice. For controls, vehicle (PBS) was injected into 3-month-
old Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK mice. At the completion of the
2-week treatment, the optic nerves were removed for anal-
ysis. After GCV administration, there was a 49% reduc-
tion in the numbers of Iba1+ microglia in the optic nerves of
the 3-month-old GCV-treated versus vehicle-treated control
mice (Fig. 3A). No differences in numbers of Iba1+ cells or
Ki67-positive cells between PBS-treated Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK
mice were found compared with GCV-treated Nf1+/jGFAPCKO
mice lacking the CD11b-TK transgene (data not shown).
Consistent with previous studies using minocycline (20), GCV-
mediated microglia ablation reduced optic glioma proliferation
(Ki67-positive staining), by 94% (Fig. 3B). This reduction in
proliferation reÔ¨Çects reduced glial cell proliferation and not
microglia proliferation, as demonstrated by a lack of double
labeling for Ki67 and Iba1 (Figure, Supplemental Digital Con-
tent 3, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A201) (20). In contrast to the
effects of GCV treatment on microglia cell numbers and optic
glioma proliferation, there was no significant change in the
number of CD34+ cells within the optic nerves of GCV-treated
Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK mice compared with vehicle-treated con-
trols (Fig. 3C). Together with previous studies, these new
Ô¨Åndings establish a critical role for microglia in the main-
tenance of Nf1 mouse optic glioma proliferation.

Microglia Ablation During Optic Glioma
Development Reduces Tumor Proliferation

One of the unique opportunities afforded by GEM tumor
models is the ability to deÔ¨Åne the role of stromal cell types
during tumor evolution. We hypothesized that microglia might
also have important functions during optic glioma formation
that may be distinct from their growth-promoting role in
glioma maintenance. Previously, we showed that the earliest

√ì 2010 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

changes in optic nerve organization were observed between 3
and 6 weeks, as evidenced by increased numbers of microglia
(20), increased glial cell proliferation (9, 26), and disruption
of the relationship between optic nerve axons and their
associated glia (43). To determine the impact of microglia
inactivation/ablation during the early phase of optic glioma
formation, we treated Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK mice with GCV
or control vehicle (PBS) for 2 weeks beginning at the age of
3 weeks.

Similar to the GCV-treated 3-month-old Nf1+/jGFAP
CKO-TK mice, there was a 43% decrease in the number of
Iba1+ cells in the optic nerves of GCV-treated mice at 3 to
5 weeks versus controls (Fig. 4A). After GCV treatment, optic
glioma proliferation was decreased by 63% (Fig. 4B), with
no change in the number of CD34+ cells (Fig. 4C). These
results demonstrate for the Ô¨Årst time that microglia also facili-
tate glial cell proliferation during the early phases of optic
glioma development.

Nf1+/j Optic Nerves Have Increased Numbers
of Microglia at the Age of 6 Weeks But Not
3 Weeks or 3 Months

We next sought

to determine whether Nf1 hetero-
zygosity resulted in a temporally and spatially restricted in-
crease in microglia numbers. For these studies, we performed
Iba1 immunostaining in the optic nerves and brains of Nf1+/j
and WT mice at 2 time points: before obvious glioma for-
mation (3 weeks and 6 weeks) and a time point when radio-
graphically and histologically evident gliomas are seen
(3 months). At 3 weeks, Nf1+/j and WT mice had equivalent
numbers of Iba1+ cells in the optic nerve, but at 6 weeks,
microglia numbers in the WT optic nerve had decreased com-
pared with the WT optic nerve at 3 weeks, whereas the number
of microglia in the Nf1+/j optic nerve did not decline
(Figs. 5A, B). This difference in microglia dispersal resulted
in a 2-fold increase in the number of microglia in the optic
nerves of Nf1+/j mice compared with their WT littermates.
By 3 months, no differences in optic nerve microglia numbers
were observed between Nf1+/j and WT mice (Figs. 5A, B).
These results support the notion that there is developmental
(temporal) regulation of microglia numbers in the optic nerve
resulting from Nf1 heterozygosity, suggesting that Nf1+/j
microglia have delayed or defective dispersion.

To determine whether this effect of Nf1 heterozygosity
on microglia number was also spatially regulated, we counted
microglia in the brainstem and neocortex of the Nf1+/j and
WT mice. In striking contrast to the temporal effects of Nf1
heterozygosity in optic nerves, no differences in brainstem
or neocortex microglia numbers were observed at 3 weeks,
6 weeks, or 3 months between Nf1+/j mice and their WT
littermates (Figs. 5C, D). Thus, Nf1 heterozygosity results in
both a temporal and spatial increase in microglia within the
mouse optic nerve.

CX3CR1 Expression Is Reduced in the Optic
Nerves of Nf1+/j Mice

One of the key chemokines that regulate microglia
dispersal in the brain is fractalkine or CX3CL1 (44, 45).

Microglia and Nf1 Glioma Growth

FIGURE 3. Microglia ablation at 3 months reduces optic glioma proliferation. (A, B) Treatment of Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK mice (n = 7)
with ganciclovir (GCV) at 3 months reduces the number of Iba1+ cells by 49% (p = 0.0280) and results in a 94% decrease in
the number of Ki67-positive cells in the optic nerve (p = 0.0118) versus Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK mice treated with vehicle (n = 7).
(C) Ganciclovir treatment did not affect endothelial cell numbers, as assessed by CD34 immunohistochemistry (p = 0.2864).

CX3CL1 acts on its receptor, CX3CR1, to regulate microglia
migration and function (46), and loss of CX3CR1 expression
has been reported to lead to subretinal microglia cell accu-
mulation (47). To determine whether altered CX3CL1/
CX3CR1 expression could account for abnormal accumu-

lation of microglia in the optic nerves of 6-week-old Nf1+/j
mice, we Ô¨Årst measured Cx3cl1 mRNA levels by qPCR in
Nf1+/j and WT optic nerves at different ages. No differences
in Cx3cl1 expression were observed in Nf1+/j optic nerves
relative to their WT counterparts at any time point (Fig. 6A).

FIGURE 2. Microglia in the mouse optic nerve at 6 weeks and in mouse optic gliomas at 3 months are mainly resident microglia.
(A) Flow cytometry demonstrates that most cells from 6-week-old wild-type (WT) optic nerves (10 pooled optic nerves) are doubly
positive for both CD11b and CD68. (B) Most of these CD11b+ cells express low levels of CD45 (R1). (C) CD11b+ microglia in the
6-week-old optic nerve are also Iba1+. (D) Using double-labeling immunoÔ¨Çuorescence, there are rare cells in the 6-week-old WT optic
nerve that label with CD11b antibodies (green) alone (inset, arrowhead), whereas most (√à99%) of the microglia colabel with both
CD11b and Iba1 antibodies (inset, arrows) (n = 5). (E) Iba1+ cells express low levels of CD45 (R1). (F) CD11b magnetic cell capture of
microglia from 3-month-old Nf1+/jGFAPCKO mouse optic gliomas (7 pooled optic nerves) followed by Ô¨Çow cytometry demonstrates
that the CD11b+ cells are also almost exclusively CD45low (R1).

FIGURE 4. Microglia ablation at 3 weeks reduces early optic glioma proliferation. (A, B) Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK mice (n = 6) treated with
ganciclovir (GCV) beginning at 3 weeks reduces the number of Iba1+ cells by 43% (p = 0.0012) and results in a 63% decrease in
Ki67-positive cells in the optic nerve versus Nf1+/jGFAPCKO-TK mice (n = 6) treated with vehicle (p = 0.0013). (C) Ganciclovir
treatment did not affect endothelial cell numbers as assessed by CD34 immunohistochemistry (p = 0.5405).

Next, we examined Cx3cr1 mRNA expression by qPCR using
total RNA isolated from Nf1+/j and WT mice optic nerves at
different ages. There was a trend increase toward increased
Cx3cr1 mRNA expression at 3 weeks in Nf1+/j optic nerves
(p = 0.0855), whereas there was a 2.5-fold decrease in Cx3cr1
mRNA in Nf1+/j compared with WT optic nerves at 6 weeks
(Fig. 6B). By 3 months, Cx3cr1 mRNA expression in the
Nf1+/j optic nerves was equivalent to that in the WT mice.
Attempts to conÔ¨Årm these results at the protein level were
unsuccessful owing to the lack of suitable CX3CR1 anti-
bodies for immunohistochemistry.

To determine whether reduced CX3CR1 expression
leads to increased microglia accumulation in the optic nerve
as observed in Nf1+/j mice, we used Cx3cr1+/GFP mice in
which 1 copy of the Cx3cr1 gene was replaced with a com-

58

plementary DNA encoding green Ô¨Çuorescent protein (GFP)
(23). At 6 weeks, there were 2-fold more Iba1+ cells in the
optic nerves of Cx3cr1+/GFP mice compared with WT con-
trols (Fig. 6C). Similarly, there was an increase in the number
of Iba1+ cells in the optic nerves of Nf1+/j; Cx3cr1+/GFP
mice compared with Nf1+/j controls at 6 weeks (p
0.0001).
Collectively, these results suggest that Nf1+/j microglia exhibit
a delay in dispersal from the optic nerve related to reduced
CX3CR1 expression, resulting in increased numbers of mi-
croglia at a critical time during optic glioma development.

restricted signals emanating from the tumor microenviron-
ment. This cellular collaboration may account for the unique
pattern of glioma formation within the CNS in children with
NF1. With few exceptions, gliomas are predominantly located
along the optic pathway and less frequently in the brainstem
in young children. On the basis of this unique pattern of
gliomagenesis, we previously showed that optic nerve and
brainstem, but not the neocortex, astrocytes increase their
proliferation in response to Nf1 gene inactivation in vitro and
in vivo (48). This region-speciÔ¨Åc susceptibility to the effects
of neuroÔ¨Åbromin loss provides a receptive preneoplastic cell

type, which, in cooperation with speciÔ¨Åc signals from the
local environment, facilitates gliomagenesis.

The requirement for key stromal signals is illustrated by
studies of Nf1 GEM strains. In both peripheral and CNS
tumors, Nf1 loss in Schwann cell or glial cell precursors, re-
spectively, is not sufÔ¨Åcient for tumor formation (5, 7). Neuro-
Ô¨Åbromas or gliomas only form when Nf1 inactivation occurs
in Schwann or glial cell precursors in Nf1+/j mice (5, 8, 49).
The obligate role of Nf1+/j cells in the process of tumor for-
mation and continued growth is further underscored by studies
that identify mast cells (3, 4, 50) and microglia (20, 21) as

important stromal cell types in neuroÔ¨Åbroma and optic glioma
development and maintenance, respectively. In the current
study, we show that NF1-associated human pilocytic astrocy-
tomas have increased numbers of microglia and use several Nf1
GEM strains to establish a pivotal role for resident microglia in
both optic glioma development and maintenance.

First, we demonstrated that astrocytic tumors of all
malignancy grades harbor increased percentages of Iba1+
microglia versus nonneoplastic brain. Previous studies have

used CD68 or Iba1 to identify microglia and found correla-
tions between the malignancy grade and CD68/Iba1 immu-
nopositivity (51, 52), but others have reported differences in
microglia morphology (12) or proliferation (40) in gliomas of
varying histologic grade. We observed a statistically insig-
niÔ¨Åcant trend toward increased CD68+ cells in gliomas versus
nonneoplastic brain. We suspect that the difference between
CD68 and Iba1 as microglia markers reÔ¨Çects the fact that
CD68 recognizes other monocyte-like cells in addition to
microglia and may also stain nonmonocyte/macrophage line-
age cells, especially under pathologic conditions (33, 35, 39).
Indeed, we demonstrated that macrophages in an ischemic
region in the human brain were strongly CD68+, whereas few
cells in that pathological focus coincidentally labeled with
Iba1. These data strongly suggest that Iba1 is a more selective
marker for brain microglia (29, 30) but also highlight the need
to identify additional speciÔ¨Åc markers for resident microglia.
We found that GCV-mediated reductions in microglia
numbers were similar during tumor evolution (5Y6 weeks)
and in the established glioma (3 months). Using this method
to attenuate microglia function, we provide deÔ¨Ånitive evi-
dence for the role of microglia in glioma proliferation in
established tumors and show for the Ô¨Årst time their role in
glioma proliferation during tumor formation. Although this
method of microglia ablation should target only CNS micro-
glia, several independent experiments conÔ¨Årmed the identity
of the CD11b+ cells. Using Ô¨Çow cytometry, we found that the
normal optic nerve macrophage/monocyte population is pri-
marily composed of CD11b+ CD45low cells, consistent with
the proÔ¨Åle of resident brain microglia (34, 53). Moreover,
these microglia were CD68+ (by Ô¨Çow cytometry) and Iba1+
(by immunoÔ¨Çuorescence and Ô¨Çow cytometry). Similar to our
previous studies in human NF1-associated optic gliomas (20),
the CD11b+ population in Nf1+/jGFAPCKO mouse optic glio-
mas was CD45low resident brain microglia. Together, these re-
sults support the conclusion that genetic elimination of resident
microglia reduces optic glioma proliferation both during tumor
formation and tumor maintenance.

Because of the limited reagents currently available to
characterize brain microglia,
there are
different populations of microglia in the optic nerve at 5 to
6 weeks and 3 months. In an analogous fashion, macrophages

have been proposed to have varying functions relevant to
tumorigenesis as a function of tumor evolution (54, 55). Early
during tumor development, macrophages are active partic-
ipants in eliminating tumor cells, but as the stroma and cancer
cells coevolve an
phase emerges in which the
neoplastic cells acquire resistance to immune editing and elim-
ination (56, 57). Finally, these
tumor cells expand
and escape from immunologic pruning and create a new con-
dition where macrophages may facilitate tumor growth. It is
not clear whether these phases exist for microglia-glioma cell
interactions, but if so, it will be important to identify speciÔ¨Åc
subpopulations of microglia with unique properties germane
to a given period of glioma development and maintenance.

We also showed that Nf1 heterozygosity creates spatially
and temporally restricted differences in microglia abundance
relevant to optic glioma evolution. The fact that the numbers of
Iba1+ microglia increase in Nf1+/j mice in the optic nerve
during a deÔ¨Åned window of development suggests that this
speciÔ¨Åc microglial population might be uniquely susceptible
to the effects of reduced Nf1 expression during this period of
optic nerve maturation. We hypothesize that the accumula-
tion of Nf1+/j microglia in the optic nerve at 5 to 6 weeks
reÔ¨Çects a defect in microglia homing in response to chemo-
kines that
is unlikely that
Nf1+/j optic nerve microglia have impaired migratory abili-
ties as we have previously shown that Nf1+/j microglia have
increased motility in Boyden chamber assays in vitro (20, 21).
Rather, we propose that Nf1+/j microglia are defective in
directed migration.

instruct microglia dispersal. It

One of the major determinants controlling microglia
homing is CX3CR1 (58), which was reduced in the Nf1+/j
optic nerve. Here, we showed that reduced Cx3cr1 expression
in CX3CR1-GFP heterozygous knockout mice resulted in
a similar increase in optic nerve microglia at 6 weeks. These
results are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that
Cx3cr1-deÔ¨Åcient mice exhibit microglia accumulation in the
retina (47, 59, 60). Together, these Ô¨Åndings suggest a model
in which microglia accumulation reÔ¨Çects the impact of Nf1
heterozygosity on the developmental pattern of microglia mi-
gration in the optic nerve, thus delaying microglia dispersal
and resulting in the presence of microglia and microglia-
produced signals during a time when Nf1j/j glial progenitors
are most susceptible to expansion by stromal elements.

improved survival

Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of
CD11b+, Iba1+, CX3CR1+ microglia in human gliomas,
leading to the hypothesis that this cell population might be
important for glioma growth (61). Moreover, polymorphisms
in the human CX3CR1 gene are linked to increased survival
of patients with high-grade glioma, and patients with the
common
V249I polymorphism also had
reduced numbers of tumor-associated microglia (62). These
Ô¨Åndings raise the intriguing possibility that neuroÔ¨Åbromin
regulation of CX3CR1 expression might control microglia
function in a speciÔ¨Åc fashion to modulate neoplastic glial cell
growth in both the evolving and established optic glioma.
Collectively, our new observations suggest a mechanistic
model of stroma-tumor cell interaction relevant to optic glio-
magenesis and maintenance that envisions Nf1 heterozygosity
as an essential event that alters microglia abundance during

optic nerve development. Future studies aimed at deÔ¨Åning
the function of microglia during gliomagenesis and glioma
maintenance will be required to begin to develop treatments
that target the relevant microenvironmental cell types in this
common pediatric brain tumor.
