Abstract

The Hippo-Yap signaling pathway regulates a number of developmental and adult cellular
processes, including cell fate determination, tissue growth, and tumorigenesis. Members of the
scaffold protein angiomotin (Amot) family interact with several Hippo pathway components,
including Yap (Yes-associated protein), and either stimulate or inhibit Yap activity. We used a
combination of genetic, biochemical, and transcriptional approaches to assess the functional
consequences of the Amot-Yap interaction in mice and in human cells. Mice with a liver-specific
Amot knockout exhibited reduced hepatic “oval cell” proliferation and tumorigenesis in response

to toxin-induced injury or when crossed with mice lacking the tumor suppressor Nf2. Biochemical
examination of the Amot-Yap interaction revealed that the p130 splicing isoform of Amot (Amot-
p130) and Yap interacted in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, which involved binding of PPxY and
LPxY motifs in Amot-p130 to WW domains of Yap. In the cytoplasm, Amot-p130 prevented the
phosphorylation of Yap by blocking access of the WW domains to the kinase Lats1. Within the
nucleus, Amot-p130 was associated with the transcriptional complex containing Yap and Teads
(TEA domain family members) and contributed to the regulation of a subset of Yap target genes,
many of which are associated with tumorigenesis. These findings indicated that Amot acts as a
Yap cofactor, preventing Yap phosphorylation and augmenting its activity toward a specific set of
genes that facilitate tumorigenesis.

INTRODUCTION

Angiomotin (Amot), angiomotin-like 1 (AmotL1), and angiomotin-like 2 (AmotL2)
comprise the Motin family, a group of scaffold proteins that associate with a number of
PDZ, WW, and coiled-coil domain–containing proteins through specific binding motifs (1–
5). Amot, the first reported member of the family, was originally identified as an
angiostatin-binding protein in endothelial cells (6). The protein exists in two major splicing
isoforms (p80 and p130), both of which are localized primarily to tight junctions (7). During
angiogenesis, Amot is thought to coordinate cell migration and junctional remodeling by
promoting trafficking of Syx [synectin-binding Ras homolog gene family, member A
(RhoA)–specific guanine exchange factor] together with tight junction proteins Patj [protein
associated with lin seven 1 (PALS1)–associated tight junction protein] and Mupp1 (multiple
PDZ domain protein 1) to the leading edge of migrating endothelial cells, leading to focal
activation of RhoA at the leading edge (8). In vivo studies using transgenic zebrafish and
mouse models show that Amot functionally overlaps with AmotL1 and AmotL2 in
promoting angiogenesis and is required for normal blood vessel formation during
development (9–13). Amot also inhibits the activity of two other Rho family small
guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), Rac1 and Cdc42, by inhibiting the activity of the
GTPase-activating protein Rich1 at tight junctions (1, 2).

In addition to its role in regulating the activity of Rho family small GTPases, Amot has been
linked to the Hippo-Yap (Yes-associated protein) pathway, an evolutionarily conserved
kinase cascade that functions in a context-dependent manner in cell fate determination, cell
polarity, organ growth, tissue regeneration, stem cell maintenance, and tumorigenesis (14).
In mammalian cells, the core pathway is composed of a kinase cascade, in which the
mammalian STE20-like protein kinases 1 and 2 (Mst1/2) phosphorylate and activate the
large tumor suppressor homologs 1 and 2 (Lats1/2) kinases. Activated Lats1/2 kinases in
turn phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator Yap, leading to its cytoplasmic retention,
ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation (15, 16). When the Mst and Lats kinases are
inactive, hypophos-phorylated Yap translocates into the nucleus where it complexes with
Tead (TEA domain family) transcription factors to regulate gene expression (17). In addition
to these core components of the pathway, several regulatory components have been
identified, including Merlin (moesinezrin-radixin–like protein), Kibra (kidney and brain

protein), WW45 (45-kDWW domain protein), and Mob1 [Mps one binder (MOB) kinase
activator 1] (14, 18).

Both Amot-p80 and Amot-p130 bind directly to Merlin through their mutual coiled-coil
domains (2). Furthermore, Amot-p130, AmotL1, and AmotL2—but not Amot-p80—interact
with the WW domains of Yap through PPxY motifs located within a conserved N-terminal
glutamine-rich domain that is absent in Amot-p80 (3–5, 19, 20). These results suggest that
Amot can interact with, and potentially regulate, Hippo signaling components at both
proximal and distal points along the pathway.

This is of critical importance because previous studies have resulted in conflicting findings
regarding the roles of the Motin family in Hippo signaling and tumorigenesis. For example,
overexpression of Amot in cell lines that do not normally express endogenous Amot results
in Yap phosphorylation, its cytoplasmic sequestration, and repression of two known Yap
target genes: CTGF (which encodes connective tissue growth factor) and Cyr61 (which
encodes cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61) (3–5, 20). Likewise, knockdown of AmotL2
causes cellular transformation in MDCK canine kidney and MCF10A human breast cell
lines in vitro, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for Motin proteins (4, 5). In contrast to
these in vitro findings, results from several in vivo studies suggest that Amot plays a pro-
proliferative role during blood vessel development and tumorigenesis. For example, using an
orthotopic implantable model, we previously demonstrated that Amot is required for
tumorigenesis associated with Merlin in-activation (2). Furthermore, knocking down or
deleting Motin family members, either individually or in combination, causes defects in
endothelial cell polarization, migration, and proliferation in both mouse and zebrafish
embryos (4, 8, 10, 11, 21, 22). Here, we took advantage of several well-defined systems to
clarify the role of Amot in tumorigenesis and its relationship with the Hippo-Yap pathway.

RESULTS

Amot deletion impedes injury-induced proliferation of biliary epithelial cells

Previous studies suggested that Amot acts as a Yap antagonist and would therefore be
expected to function as a tumor suppressor. To determine whether this is the case, we
crossed Amot conditional knockout (KO) mice (Amotflox/flox) with Alb-cre transgenic mice to
generate AmotKO (Alb-cre :Amotflox/flox) mice with a liver-specific deletion of Amot.
AmotKO mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and exhibited a normal life span.
Livers from AmotKO mice were indistinguishable from cre-negative littermate controls in
overall appearance, histology, and liver weight/body weight ratios. No tumors were
observed in any of the AmotKO mouse livers examined at any time point. These results
indicate that Amot is dispensable for normal liver development and does not act as a tumor
suppressor gene in the liver.

To investigate whether Amot plays a role in a pathological response, we examined whether
Amot ablation affects hepatic cell proliferation after liver injury. The diet of AmotKO and
control mice was supplemented with 0.2% 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-l,4-dihydrocollidine
(DDC), a porphyrinogenic hepatotoxin that elicits the proliferation of biliary epithelial cells
(BECs) in portal tract regions, a histological phenomenon known as the “oval cell response”

(23). As expected control mice exhibited a marked increase in the number of cells that
stained positive for cytokeratin 19 (CK19+), a BEC marker, 3 weeks after DDC treatment
(Fig. 1A). In contrast, the average number of CK19+ cells was significantly reduced in
AmotKO mice treated with DDC compared with the treated controls, an effect that was
evident in 1-month-old mice and further pronounced in 4-month-old mice (Fig. 1A). These
results suggest that Amot is required for injury-induced proliferation of BECs.

Amot deletion inhibits hepatomegaly and tumorigenesis associated with Nf2 deficiency

We have previously shown that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated silencing of Amot
inhibited the tumorigenicity of the Nf2-null Schwann cells in an orthotopic mouse model (2).
To test whether this holds true in an endogenous tumor model, we crossed mice bearing
floxed alleles of the Nf2 and Amot genes (Nf2flox/flox, Amoflox,flox mice) to Alb-cre mice to
generate liver-specific Nf2 knockout (Nf2KO) mice and Nf2:Amot double knockout (DKO)
mice. Because the Alb-cre allele mediates recombination at the hepatoblast stage of liver
development (24), such mice would be expected to lack Nf2 and/or Amot in both hepatocytes
and BECs.

Consistent with previous reports (25, 26), we found that 100% of the Nf2KO mice exhibited
an increased number of CK19+ ductal cells in the liver, leading to an increase in the liver
weight/body weight ratio from 4.5% in control and AmotKO mice to 7% in Nf2KO mice. In
DKO mice, this ratio was reduced to 5.5% (Fig. 1B). Moreover, whereas 100% (8 of 8) of
the Nf2KO mice displayed visible hepatic tumors by 7 weeks of age, nearly a quarter (4 of
17) of the DKO mice remained tumor-free at this time point (Fig. 1C). Correspondingly, the
increase in the number of CK19+ cells in the DKO livers was also significantly reduced
when compared to the Nf2KO livers (Fig. 1, D and E). These results demonstrate that Amot
deletion partially prevents the phenotypes associated with Nf2 deficiency in the liver,
consistent with our previous finding that Amot is required for the tumorigenicity of Nf2-null
Schwann cells (2). Together, these data indicate that Amot is required in vivo for hepatic
ductal cell proliferation and tumor formation in response to either Nf2 loss or DDC injury.

The abundance of Amot is increased in Nf2-null liver tumors and human schwannomas

To elucidate how Amot may contribute to tumor development after Nf2 in-activation in the
liver, we examined Amot protein expression in the livers from control, AmotKO, Nf2KO,
and DKO mice, using immunofluorescence. In control livers, Amot staining was detected in
osteopontin (OPN)–positive BECs (Fig. 2, white arrowheads) and within the nuclei of a
subpopulation of hepatocytes (Fig. 2, white arrows). Both staining patterns were
undetectable in the AmotKO livers (Fig. 2, yellow arrows and arrowheads), confirming the
specificity of the immunofluorescent signal.

In livers from Nf2KO mice, we observed a substantial increase in Amot abundance within
the tumors compared to the adjacent nontumor regions (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, a similar
pattern of Amot staining was observed in the DKO livers that did develop tumors (Fig. 2),
implying that tumors from DKO livers may have formed from cells that “escaped”
recombination of the Amot locus. Consistent with this hypothesis, polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) analysis of genomic DNA from DKO livers revealed that, compared to the adjacent

nontumor tissue, the tumors retained more of noncombined Amot allele and correspondingly
less of the deleted Amot allele (fig. S1).

In humans, loss of Merlin (encoded by NF2) is primarily associated with neurofibromatosis
type 2 (NF2) (27). To assess the relevance of Amot to NF2, we analyzed Amot abundance in
tissue samples from 10 NF2-mutant human schwannomas and 1 normal human nerve by
IHC In contrast to the normal nerve, which showed negligible Amot staining (Fig. 3), 9 of
10 human schwannoma samples exhibited a substantial increase in Amot abundance, with
variable staining primarily in the nucleus, as well as in the cytoplasm and along the
membrane (Fig. 3).

Amot-p130 binds to the two WW domains of Yap through LPxY-PPxY motifs

The effects of Amot deletion on oval cell proliferation and liver tumorigenesis induced by
injury or Nf2 mutation are reminiscent of those of YapKO mice (26, 28). Given the reported
interactions between Motin family members and Yap (3–5), we sought to determine whether
Amot modulates liver cell proliferation and tumorigenesis phenotypes through direct
interactions with Yap.

Endogenous Amot-p130, but not Amot-p80, specifically bound to endogenous Yap in
human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells through reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays
with antibodies against Amot or Yap (fig. S2A). Consistent with previous reports, we found
that the N-terminal domain of Amot-p130 alone was necessary and sufficient for Yap
binding (fig. S2B), and Amot-p130 bound to both WW domains of Yap (fig. S2, C and D).
However, upon closer examination of the Amot-p130 primary sequence (fig. S3), we
discovered a previously unidentified, conserved, atypical LPxY motif (LPTY, denoted
PY1), which lies upstream of the two previously reported PPxY motifs (denoted PY2 and
PY3) within the N-terminal domain of Amot-p130 (fig. S2C and S3). This LPxY motif is
also conserved in AmotL1 and AmotL2 (fig. S3).

To investigate the functional importance of this LPxY motif, we mutated each of these
proline-containing sequences individually or in combination. Whereas single mutation of
either the LPxY motif (PY1) or the first PPxY motif (PY2) caused partial or no reduction in
Amot-Yap binding, simultaneous mutation of both motifs completely abolished this
interaction (fig. S2E). These results demonstrate that the Amot-Yap interaction is mediated
by the binding of the LPxY-PPxY motifs of Amot to the two WW domains of Yap.

Amot-p130 promotes Yap nuclear translocation by inhibiting its interaction with Lats1/2

Previous studies examining the impact of Amot on Yap activity relied on overexpression of
Amot-p130 in cell lines that do not normally express this protein, resulting in the formation
of abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates, which may have confounded interpretations (3–5). To
avoid this pitfall, we expressed N-terminal Flag-tagged Amot-p80 and Amot-p130 in
HEK293 cells, which have high basal abundance of both Amot isoforms.

Subcellular fractionation indicated that, similar to silencing Merlin, overexpressing Amot-
p130, but not Amot-p80, inhibited Yap phosphorylation at Ser127, which appeared to
increase the amount of nuclear Yap and correspondingly decreased cytoplasmic Yap (Fig.

4A and fig. S4A). Conversely, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Amot in HEK293 cells
reduced the abundance of nuclear Yap (Fig. 4A and S4A), whereas Cre-mediated deletion of
Amot from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) increased the amount of phosphorylated
Yap (p-Yap) without affecting total Yap protein abundance (Fig. 4B). These results suggest
that Amot-p130 functions to maintain the steady-state abundance of active, nuclear Yap at
least in part by inhibiting its phosphorylation.

Because both Amot-p130 and the Lats1/2 kinases bind to the WW domains of Yap, we
hypothesized that Amot-p130 may inhibit Yap phosphorylation and promote Yap nuclear
translocation by blocking access of Lats1/2 to Yap. Consistent with this scenario,
overexpression of Amot-p130 inhibited the Lats1-Yap interaction in HEK293 cells, and
conversely, shRNA-mediated Amot knockdown enhanced this interaction (Fig. 4C).
Overexpression of Amot-p130 had no effect on the binding of the WW domain-containing
protein Sav1 (also known as WW45) to either Lats1 or Mst2 (fig. S4B), suggesting that
Amot-p130 specifically regulates the Lats1-Yap interaction.

Amot-p130 requires binding to Yap to support the proliferation of Nf2-deficient cells

To determine whether the regulation of Yap’s subcellular localization by Amot-p130
requires direct Yap binding, we transfected vector control, Amot-p80, Amot-p130N (unique
N-terminal domain of p130), wild-type Amot-p130, or single, dual, or triple PY-mutant
Amot-p130 into HEK293 cells and performed subcellular fractionation studies. As expected,
overexpression of wild-type Amot-p130 or the PY single mutants caused a localization shift
of Yap from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. 5A). By contrast, expression of Amot-p80,
Amot-p130N, or Amot-p130 PY double or triple mutants that are defective in Yap binding
appeared to have little effect on the ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear Yap compared with
controls (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate that Amot-p130 influences the subcellular
localization of Yap through direct interactions.

We have previously generated Nf2-null mouse SC4 Schwann cell lines that stably express
Amot shRNAs (SC4/sh-Amot), which exhibit reduced proliferation and tumorigenesis
compared with control SC4 cells (2). Consistent with what we observed in HEK293 cells
using subcellular fractionation analysis (Fig. 4A and fig. S4A), analysis by
immunofluorescence staining indicated that knockdown of Amot in SC4 cells caused a shift
of Yap localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). This effect of Amot
knockdown on Yap subcellular localization appeared to be reversed by reintroduction of
wild-type, but not LY1/PY2 double mutant, Amot-p130 into SC4/sh-Amot cells (Fig. 5B),
again suggesting that Amot-p130 requires direct binding to Yap to promote its nuclear
translocation. Additionally only reintroduction of wild-type, but not LY1/PY2 double
mutant, Amot-p130 rescued the proliferation defect of SC4/sh-Amot cells (Fig. 5C).
Together, these data suggest that Amot-Yap interaction is essential for the pro-proliferative
role of Amot in the absence of Merlin.

Amot-p130 is a component of the Yap-Tead transcriptional complex and regulates the
transcription of a subset of Yap target genes

We noted from our cell fractionation studies with HEK293 cells that the two isoforms of
Amot were present in both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear compartments (Figs. 4A and
5A). Relative to Amot-p80, Amot-p130 appeared to be enriched in the nucleus in these cells
(Fig. 4A). This finding prompted us to examine whether the Amot-Yap interaction is present
in the nucleus and not restricted to the cytoplasmic compartment, as suggested by previous
studies (4, 5).

Immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Amot efficiently pulled down endogenous Yap
from both cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates of HEK293 cells (Fig. 6A and fig. S4D). Amot
immunoprecipitates also pulled down Tead1 exclusively in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 6A).
This interaction was dependent on Yap because Yap knockdown using each of two
independent shRNAs reduced the amount of Tead1 that coprecipitated with Amot (Fig. 6B).
Overexpression of Amot-p130 together with Yap and Tead1 to Tead4 did not substantially
alter the amount of Teads that coprecipitated with Yap (fig. S4C). These results suggest that
Amot-p130 is recruited by Yap to the Yap-Tead complex within the nucleus.

To examine the possibility that Amot-p130 directly participates in Yap-Tead-mediated
transcription, we carried out a microarray analysis of control, Amot-knockdown (Amot-
KD), and Yap-knockdown (Yap-KD) HEK293 cells. As many as 48 to 55% of the genes
differentially expressed in Amot-KD cells were also differentially expressed in Yap-KD
cells (Fig. 6C and fig. S5A). Among the genes co-regulated by Amot and Yap (table S1),
99.5% or more were regulated in the same direction. Of the 1127 genes whose expression
changed by more than 1.5-fold in both Amot-KD cells and Yap-KD cells, 1121 were either
increased or decreased in both data sets concordantly (Fig. 6C), whereas this was observed
for 100% of genes whose expression changed more than 2-fold (fig. S5A). Gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed a strong correlation between top-ranked Amot-
regulated genes and top-ranked Yap-regulated genes (fig. S5B). In aggregate, our
transcriptional analysis suggests that Amot and Yap primarily act in an overlapping fashion
regarding their effects on gene transcription.

To assess the role of Amot in Yap-Tead-mediated transcription, we used a GTIIC-luciferase
reporter construct that carries eight copies of the minimal Tead-binding sequence (29). As
expected, overexpression of either wild-type or a constitutively active S112A
(corresponding to S127A in human Yap) mouse Yap (mYap), but not the empty vector,
induced GTIIC reporter activity in control HEK293 cells, with the S112A mutant exerting a
greater effect (Fig. 6D and fig. S6A). In contrast, neither wild-type nor S112A mYap
expression had a significant effect on GTIIC reporter activity in Amot-KD HEK293 cells
(Fig. 6D and fig. S6A). Reexpression of Amot-p130, but not of Amot-p80 or PY-mutant
Amot-p130, partially rescued the ability of Yap to stimulate GTIIC reporter activity in
Amot-KD HEK293T cells (fig. S6C), suggesting that Amot-p130 is necessary for Yap-
Tead-mediated transcriptional activity. We further conducted chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with Flag antibodies in wild-type or Amot-KD HEK293 cells
transfected with Flag-tagged Yap S112A. Silencing Amot inhibited the binding of Flag-Yap

S112A to the promoter of ApoE, an Amot/Yap negatively co-regulated gene identified from
our microarray study (Fig. 6E and fig. S6B). In contrast, the ability of Flag-Yap S112A to
bind to the promoter of CTGF, which is positively regulated by Yap, was not significantly
affected by knockdown of Amot (Fig. 6E and fig. S6B). Thus, Amot likely modulates Yap-
Tead–mediated transcription by affecting the recruitment of Yap to the promoters of a subset
of Yap target genes.

To investigate whether Amot-p130 is part of an endogenous DNA-bound Yap-Tead
transcriptional complex, we conducted ChIP analysis using immunoglobulin G (IgG)
(control), Amot, and Yap antibodies. Both endogenous Amot and Yap were enriched at the
proximal promoter of ApoE as well as two previously reported Yap targets: AREG (which
encodes amphiregulin) and TGFB1 [which encodes transforming growth factor–β1
(TGFβ1)] (9, 30, 31) (Fig. 7A). Sequential ChIP first with Amot antibody followed by either
IgG control or Yap antibody revealed that Amot and Yap concurrently occupied ApoE,
AREG, and TGFB1 in wild-type HEK293 cells, suggesting that Amot and Yap are present
within a common regulatory complex on the promoters of these genes (Fig. 7B). No
enrichment of these genes was detected in Amot-KD HEK293 cells, thus verifying the
specificity of the Amot antibody used in this study (fig. S6D and Fig. 7B). Although we
observed association of Yap with the CTGF promoter, we did not obtain significant
enrichment of Amot at the same region in wild-type HEK293 cells under the same
conditions (Fig. 7A and fig. S6D). Together, these data suggest that Amot-p130 is a
component of the nuclear Yap-Tead transcriptional complex and directly participates in the
transcription regulation of a subset of Yap target genes.

DISCUSSION

Given the broad context-dependent activities of the Hippo-Yap pathway, crosstalk between
the core Hippo kinase cascade and other signaling inputs is likely to influence the nature
and/or intensity of the signaling output (32–34). One candidate mediator of such crosstalk is
Amot, a scaffold protein that can interact with other proteins through PDZ-binding, WW-
binding, and coiled-coiled domains. Although we and others have found that Amot binds to
components of the Hippo-Yap pathway, the nature and significance of such interactions
remain poorly understood. Here, we used mice with a liver-specific deletion of Amot to
determine the functional role of Amot in vivo and conducted a series of biochemical and
transcriptional analyses to understand how Amot regulates Yap activity. We conclude that
Amot acts to augment, rather than inhibit, Yap function by influencing its phosphorylation,
localization, and capacity to transactivate its transcriptional targets (Fig. 7C).

Several groups have reported that Amot is a major Yap-interacting protein (3–5, 20, 35).
Indeed, we pursued these studies, in part because we independently identified Amot as a
major Yap-interacting protein through unbiased mass spectrometry experiments, a surprising
result given that Amot was thought to be a tight junction protein, whereas Yap is a
transcriptional coactivator that shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. A similar
example of such an interaction is that of the junctional protein ZO2, which interacts with
Yap2 in the nucleus (36). We used HEK293 cells, which normally express Yap and Amot, to
confirm that this interaction occurs endogenously. We further showed that Yap-Amot-p130

binding is mediated by the two WW domains of Yap and one of the two previously
identified PY motifs, as well as a third upstream atypical PY motif located in the N-terminal
domain of Amot-p130.

One major mechanism by which the cell regulates Hippo-Yap activity is by controlling Yap
localization through phosphorylation-dependent sequestration and degradation (15, 16).
Using HEK293 cells, we found that Amot overexpression promotes Yap nuclear
localization, whereas Amot knockdown promotes cytoplasmic localization. This effect was
associated with changes in Yap phosphorylation status. Moreover, changes in localization
were specific to Amot-p130 (and not Amot-p80) and required a direct interaction between
Amot and Yap because PY mutations that abrogated the Amot-Yap interaction also
abrogated this effect on nuclear localization.

The finding that Amot-p130 promotes nuclear localization of Yap is at odds with recent
studies that found that in HeLa, MCF10A, and MDCK cells, Amot-p130 overexpression
causes translocation of Yap from the nucleus into the cytoplasm or to tight junctions in the
case of MDCK cells (3–5). However, because HeLa and MCF10A do not normally express
Amot-p130 [fig. S1D in (5)], and exogenously expressed Amots in these cells form mainly
cytoplasmic aggregates, the results obtained using these cell lines must be interpreted with
caution. Stable expression of Amot-p130 in MDCK cells, where it is correctly targeted to
tight junctions, leads to an increase in both nuclear and total Yap [fig. S3B in (5)]. Loss-of-
function studies showed that silencing of AmotL2, but not AmotL1, increased the
localization of Yap and Taz to the nucleus and induced cellular transformation in MDCK
and MCF10A cells (3–5). Thus, some of the discrepancies between our finding and other
studies could also be due to tissue- or cell type–specific functions of different members of
the Motin family.

Although the biochemical basis for Amot’s effect on Yap phosphorylation and localization
remains to be determined, one possible mechanism involves the interaction between Yap
and Lats1. We found that Amot-p130 overexpression disrupts formation of the Yap-Lats1
complex, whereas Amot knockdown enhances it. Thus, we speculate that cytoplasmic Amot
acts as a rheostat for the association of Yap and its inhibitory kinase (Fig. 7C). In the setting
of limiting levels of Amot, Yap associates with Lats1 and is phosphorylated, leading to its
cytoplasmic retention and degradation, whereas high levels of Amot interfere with the Yap-
Lats1 interaction, preventing Yap phosphorylation and thereby facilitating its nuclear entry.

Our findings stand in contrast to a report suggesting that the Amots increase Yap
phosphorylation by interacting with and activating the Lats kinases (20). One significant
caveat of this study is that the experiments were performed primarily by overexpressing C-
terminal–tagged Amots. Because Amot requires a free C-terminal PDZ-binding motif to
associate with PDZ domain–containing proteins such as Patj/Mupp1, adding a C-terminal
tag to Amot would likely interfere with its normal functions/localizations. Indeed despite our
repeated attempts, we were unable to detect, any specific association between our N-
terminal–tagged Amot constructs and the Lats kinases in HEK293 cells.

In the course of our cellular fractionation experiments, we found that a large fraction of
endogenous Amot-p130 is present in the nucleus of HEK293 cells. This result was
surprising given previous reports that ectopic expression of Amot-p130 in MCF10A and
HeLa cells leads to cytoplasmic retention of Yap or its paralog Taz (3–5). Moreover, we
found that immunoprecipitation of Amot from the nuclear fraction pulled down Tead1 in
addition to Yap, suggesting that Amot may be part of a transcriptionally active nuclear
complex (Fig. 7C). To test this possibility, we examined the effects on global transcription
after knocking down either Amot or Yap in the same cell line. This analysis revealed a
significant overlap between the transcriptional changes caused by Amot knockdown and
those caused by Yap knockdown, with more than 40% of the genes that exhibited a
transcriptional change with either Amot or Yap knockdown showing a corresponding
change in the other group. Almost all changes in transcript abundance occurred in the same
direction, such that most genes whose expression increased after Amot knockdown were
also increased after Yap knockdown, and the same was true for genes whose expression
decreased.

Notably, the well-characterized Yap target CTGF was among a half-dozen genes whose
transcript amounts did not change in the same direction (CTGF transcript abundance
decreased after Yap-KD and increased after Amot-KD; fig. S6B). In the aforementioned
studies by Chan et al. (3) and Zhao et al. (5), the authors concluded that Amot antagonizes
Yap transcriptional activity, in part because knockdown of Amot with shRNAs increased
transcript abundance of CTGF. Although our global transcriptional analysis confirms this
finding, it also indicates that this effect of Amot knockdown on CTGF is the exception
rather than the rule, in that it was one of a very small number of genes whose expression was
regulated in an opposite manner by Amot and Yap. At a global gene regulation level, more
than 99% of genes that responded to loss of Amot or Yap did so in the same direction,
strongly suggesting that the two proteins generally function in a cooperative manner.

Consistent with this notion, we found that Amot-p130 is part of a Tead1-containing nuclear
complex that associates with the proximal promoters of several Yap targets, including ApoE,
AREG, and TGFβ (but not CTGF). Sequential ChIP demonstrated that Yap and Amot are
present within the same transcription factor complex, and luciferase and ChIP assays
showed that Amot knockdown inhibits Yap-Tead–dependent transcription of several Yap
target genes because of compromised recruitment of Yap to their promoters. Together, these
results strongly suggest that Amot-p130 can act as a co-factor in a transcriptionally active
Yap-Tead– containing complex at a subset of Yap target genes.

Questions remain as to how Amot-p130 may modulate the specificity of Yap-Tead–
mediated transcription. GSEA of the genes regulated by Amot and Yap in HEK293 cells
shows substantial enrichment of genes involved in proteasome pathways and several
metabolic pathways (table S2). However, future studies in perhaps more disease-relevant
cell types will be necessary to cross-validate the significance of these findings and to
identify the additional factors or modifications that govern Amot-p130’s selectivity.

Given the discrepancies arising from in vitro readouts for Amot’s effects on Yap localization
and function, it was essential to determine whether, and if so how, Amot modulated Yap

activity in vivo. In AmotKO livers, we observed a reduction in the biliary ductal cell
proliferation that occurs after toxin exposure (the so-called oval cell response), a finding that
is quite similar to the blunted response to bile duct ligation observed in yap-null livers (28).
Furthermore, our results are consistent with previous observations that conditional deletion
of the Hippo-Yap pathway components WW45/Sav1 or Mst1/2 results in an exacerbated oval
cell response to DDC, effects that are mediated by increased Yap activity (37–39).
Moreover, Amot deficiency inhibited tumorigenesis caused by Nf2 deletion, which requires
Yap activity (26). Indeed, the tumors that arose in DKO mice, similar to those in Nf2KO
mice, had high levels of Amot expression, indicating that tumors in DKO mice had arisen
from cells that escaped Amot deletion. These results, together with our observation of
increased Amot abundance in the majority of NF2-associated human schwannomas, raise
the possibility that increased abundance of Amot facilitates tumorigenesis after NF2
inactivarion by increasing Yap activity. Contrary to previous reports, our in vivo genetic
studies demonstrated that Amot acts in concert with Yap during injury-related bile duct cell
proliferation and tumorigenesis.

It is also important to note that although deletion of Yap during liver development leads to
bile duct paucity (26), there were no detectable effects on bile duct development in AmotKO
mice. Thus, Amot deficiency does not phenocopy Yap deficiency in a developmental
context. There are several possible explanations for this difference. First, the appearance of
an Amot phenotype during oval cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, rather than embryonic
development, may reflect a “threshold” effect whereby Amot is required when a biological
response hinges on the “high” activity of Yap signaling, as occurs after biliary injury.
Alternatively, Amot may act as a co-regulator at a different set of targets during
development compared with adulthood. Finally, functional redundancy could account for the
differences in Yap- and Amot-mutant phenotypes because different biological processes may
be differentially sensitive to compensation by other Motin family members (AmotL1 and
AmotL2). Additional experiments using conditional deletion of multiple Motin family
members will help to clarify this question.

In summary, we have shown that Amot facilitated the nuclear entry and transcriptional
activity of Yap and was required in the liver for ductal cell proliferation and tumorigenesis
in response to liver injury or Nf2 deletion. Questions remain as to how loss of Nf2 leads to
increased abundance of Amot in murine livers and human schwannomas and whether
overexpression of Amot is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in the absence of Nf2 deletion. In
the future, it will also be critical to understand how Amot itself is regulated. Because Amot
functions in other contexts as a tight junction scaffold protein that modulates cell polarity
complexes, it is possible that this protein also participates in the well-established connection
between the Hippo-Yap pathway and apical-basal polarity (40).

described previously (41,42). For liver tumor studies, mice were fed a regular diet and
euthanized at 7 weeks of age. For the liver injury experiments, mouse chow containing 0.2%
DDC (Harlan Teklad) was fed to 1- or 4-month-old male mice continuously for 3 weeks
until euthanization.

Constructs and shRNAs

pCMV-Flag–tagged Amot-p80 and Amot-p130, V5-tagged Yap, Myc-tagged Lats1 and
Lats2, and Flag-tagged WW45 were generated as described previously (2, 43). pCMV-Flag–
tagged Amot-p80 and Amot-p130 LPxY/PPxY mutants were generated with Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene. Wild-type mYap was generated by cloning full-length
mYAP complementary DNA (cDNA) (Addgene) into the pCMV-tag-2A vector
(Stratagene). The S112A mYAP mutant was generated with the Stratagene mutagenesis kit.
Gal4-TEAD3 and Gal4-TFAD4 were gifts from J. Hogenesch (University of Pennsylvania).
Gal4-TEAD2 was constructed by cloning the full-length TEAD2 cDNA (Addgene) into the
CM-Gal4 vector (44). pLKO-shRNA lead-viral constructs targeting human Yap (clone IDs:
TRCN0000107266 and TRCN0000107268) were purchased from Thermo Scientific Open
Bio-systems. Two human Amot shRNA vectors were described previously (2).

Antibodies

Purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Amot were previously described (2). The
following antibodies were commercially purchased: Merlin (c-18), c-Myc (9E10), HA
(Y11), HA (F7), Gal4, and GST (Z5) from Santa Cruz Technology; Merlin, Yap, p-Yap
(Ser127), and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) from Cell Signaling
Technology; tubulin, rabbit Flag, and mouse Flag (M2) from Sigma; and OPN from R&D
Systems. Antibodies against CK19 were gifts from D Melton (Harvard University).

Cell culture, transfection, and infection conditions

All cells were maintained in low-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium + 10% fetal
calf serum + 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Wild-type and Amot-KD HEK293 cells were
transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Invitrogen). For retroviral production, retroviral vectors were transfected into 293 Phoenix
A packaging cells. For lentiviral production, lentiviral vectors were cotransfected with
packaging vectors Δ8.5 and VSVG into HEK293 cells. Viral supernatants were collected at
48 and 72 hours after transfection. To infect cells, we added 2 ml of viral supernatants
containing polybrene (8 µg/ml) to cells grown on six-well plates and spun at 3000 rpm at
room temperature for 2 hours. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were selected with
puromycin (2 ng/ml). MEFs were isolated from embryonic day 13.5 Amoflox mouse embryos
and infected with Adeno or Adeno-Cre viruses as previously described (45).

and pellets containing nuclei were washed twice with hypotonic buffer and subsequently
lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer.

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence

Tissues were paraffin-embedded and processed. Antigen retrieval was performed by
incubating deparaffinized slides with R-Buffer A with 0.1% trypsin in an antigen retrieval
chamber (Electron Microscopy Science) for 15 min at 37°C. Amot immunofluorescence was
performed with the TSA (tyramide signal amplification) kit (Perkin Elmer). The ABC
(avidin/biotin complex) kit was used for IHC (Vector Lab). For both IHC and TSA kits, the
endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with a 30-min incubation in 7.5% hydrogen
peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) immediately after retrieval. Slides are blocked with either 2%
normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for IHC or buffer provided with the TSA
kit. The slides are incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. All secondary
antibody steps are done at room temperature for 1 to 1.5 hours.

Luciferase reporter assay

GTIIC-luciferase reporter was a gift from H. Sasaki at RIKEN, Japan (29). Renilla
luciferase vector was purchased from Promega. Cells were transfected in 96-well plates with
FuGene 6 (Roche R&D) 24 hours before the luciferase assay. The GTIIC-luciferase reporter
activity was determined with the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). The reporter’s firefly
luciferase activity was normalized to that of the internal control Renilla luciferase before all
statistical analysis. The annotated relative luciferase activity is the ratio between firefly and
Renilla luciferase activities.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation

Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by incubation in 0.125 M
glycine for 5 min. The fixed cells were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer [50 mM tris (pH
8.0), 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS] and sonicated for 30 min (high, 10 min per cycle, 30 s
on/off) on a Bioruptor (Diagenode). The sonicated lysates were diluted with ChIP dilution
buffer [20 mM tris (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100] and
precleared for 2 hours before incubating with Flag-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma-
Aldrich) or the indicated primary antibodies plus protein G–agarose beads with salmon
sperm DNA (Millipore) overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed first with low-salt buffer
[20 mM tris (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100],
followed by high-salt buffer [20 mM tris (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS,
and 1% Triton X-100], then LiCl buffer [10 mM tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl,
1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% NP-40], and finally twice with TE [10 mM tris (pH 8.0)
and 1 mM EDTA] before eluting with freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 M
NaHCO3). The cross-link reversal was performed at 65°C overnight in the presence of 200
mM NaCl. The eluted chromatins were then incubated with protein digestion buffer [5 µl of
0.5 M EDTA, 10 µl of 1 M tris (pH 6.5), and 1 µl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml)] at 45°C for 4
hours and finally purified with the PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Quantitative analysis of
chromatin enrichment was performed by real-time PCR. Primer sequences are provided in
table S3.

For sequential ChIP, both rounds of the ChIP were performed as described above. The beads
used for the ChIP were protein A/G beads with salmon sperm DNA (Millipore). Instead of
using the standard elution buffer at the end of the first ChIP with the Amot antibody, the
beads were eluted in tris-EDTA with 10 mM DTT at 37°C for 30 min. The resulting
supernatant was diluted with ChIP dilution buffer and subjected to a second round of ChIP
with either IgG or Yap antibodies.

TRI reagent. The Epicentre TargetAmp Nano-g Biotin-aRNA Labeling Kit was used to
generate amplified complementary RNA (cRNA). Biotinylated, amplified cRNA at 750 ng
was then hybridized to the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip. All arrays were
processed in the Wistar Institute Genomics Facility.

Statistical analysis

ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni procedure were used for the comparisons of the liver
weight/body weight ratio and CK19+ cell count among the four mouse strains (control,
AmotKO, Nf2KO, and DKO). For each pairwise comparison, Bonferroni’s adjusted P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Two-group t test was used for comparing CK19+ cell
counts between control and AmotKO tissue at 1 and 4 months of age, and P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

For microarray data analysis, raw data were first quantile-normalized and then filtered to
remove noninformative probes that were either expressed at background level or showing
little variation among samples (maximum fold change <1.2). A t test was used to assess
changes in gene expression between the two knockdown groups and the controls (Amot-KD
versus controls and Yap-KD versus controls). In both comparisons, significant genes were
selected with a cutoff of P < 0.05. Three fold-change cutoffs (FC >1.5, 2, and 3) were
applied to select for genes that were most differentially expressed. These two lists were then
overlapped to determine the similarity in the effects of the Yap compared with Amot
knockdowns. All data preprocessing and analysis were performed in MATLAB R2010a.

A normal human nerve and 10 human schwannoma sections were analyzed by IHC with an
Amot antibody. Shown are two representative images from schwannoma sample XT3908
and one from a normal nerve. In each case, the entire section was scored and moderate
diffuse staining (upper panel) was scored as +1, strong focal staining (middle panel) was
scored as +2, and minimal background staining (bottom panel) was scored as +/−. Right
panels show the higher-magnification images of the areas enclosed by the dotted lines.

Fig. 6. Amot is part of a nuclear Yap-Tead complex and required for Yap-Tead–mediated
transcription
(A) Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of endogenous Amot-Yap and Amot-Yap-
Tead complexes from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HEK293 cells. Whole-lysate blot
is present in fig. S4D. Image is representative of three independent experiments. (B)
Immunoprecipitation and Western analysis of Amot, Yap, and Tead1 in total cell lysates
from HEK293 cells stably expressing control (Ctrl) or two independent Yap shRNAs
(Yapsh#1 or Yapsh#2). Image is representative of three independent experiments. (C)

Microarray-derived Venn diagram of genes for which expression changed more than 1.5-
fold by knock-down of Amot (light blue) or Yap (white) compared with control HEK293
cells. The number of genes that changed in both conditions is in the overlap (blue), either
regardless of direction (nondirectional) or which either increased in both or decreased in
both conditions (directional). IFCI = absolute fold change. (D) Dual-luciferase reporter
assays of control and Amot-KD HEK293 cells transfected with WT or S112A, GTIIC-
luciferase, and phRL-CMV vectors. Data are means ± SEM of the relative luciferase activity
(calculated by normalizing firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity from the
same well) from three independent experiments. **P < 0.01, two-tailed t test. (E) ChIP
analysis for Flag-Yap in lysates from control and Amot-KD HEK293 cells transfected with
vector or Flag-Yap S112A. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed
with eluted DNA using primers targeting the promoter regions of ApoE and CTGF. Data are
means ± SEM from three independent experiments.

Fig. 7. Amot associates with a chromatin-bound Yap-Tead transcriptional complex
(A) ChIP with IgG, Amot, or Yap antibody in HEK293 cell lysates, followed by real-time
qPCR analysis of the promoter regions of ApoE, AREG, TGFB1, and CTGF. Enrichment of
each product was calculated relative to input. Data are means ± SEM from three independent
experiments. (B) Sequential ChIP with Amot antibody followed by IgG or Yap in control
and Amot-KD HEK293 cell lysates, followed by real-time qPCR analysis of the promoter
regions of ApoE, AREG, and TGFB1 genes. The fold of enrichment of each product with
Yap antibody was calculated relative to IgG after Amot ChIP. Data are means ± SEM from

three independent experiments. (C) Schematic representation of the multiple interactions of
Amot with Merlin-Hippo-Yap signaling in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In this
model, Amot-p130 prevents Yap-Lats1/2 (LATS) interaction in the cytoplasm and LATS-
mediated Yap phosphorylation. Subsequently, the Amot-p130/Yap complex translocates to
the nucleus to regulate Tead-target gene transcription. TJ, tight junction.
