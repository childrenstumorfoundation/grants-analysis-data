The putative oncogene CPI-17 is up-regulated
in schwannoma

subunit 14A, 17 kDa) was

CPI-17 (PPP1R14A protein phosphatase 1 regulatory
inhibitor
previously
described to act as an oncoprotein in the merlin path-
way. The myosin phosphatase and its substrate merlin
are part of a tumour suppressor cascade that can be
blocked in two ways; by mutation of the NF2 gene
encoding the tumour suppressor protein merlin and by
up-regulation of the speciﬁc myosin phosphatase inhibi-
tor, CPI-17. Inactivation of the merlin tumour suppres-
sor pathway is thought to be a major principle of
transformation by CPI-17 [1]. While CPI-17 mis-
expression was demonstrated in several human tumour
cell lines, Thurneysen et al. [2] showed for the ﬁrst time
that CPI-17 plays a role as oncogene in human malig-
nancies. The authors found that CPI-17 expression in
mesothelioma is signiﬁcantly increased in tumours with-
out deleted NF2 gene, compared to normal pleura and
tumours with truncating NF2 mutations.

the
potential importance of merlin inactivation as determi-

neuroﬁbromatosis

broma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour
(MPNST)] along with 28 peripheral nervous system
biopsies harbouring

expression of CPI-17 (Table 1, [3–5]). All procedures
involving human participants in this study were in

tional and/or national research committee and with
the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amend-

a nontumour

pathology

Firstly, we performed speciﬁcity validation of

two
commercially available CPI-17 antibodies: (i) a murine

monoclonal (C1) and (ii) a goat polyclonal (A20) CPI-
17 antibody; both raised against an N-terminal CPI-17
epitope of human origin. By Western blot analysis, we
found that a human melanoma cell line (RPM-MC) [6],
previously shown to express CPI-17, gave a positive
signal (Figure 1a). In contrast, the human arachnoidal
cell line (AC-1) [7] was found to be CPI-17 negative.
However,
transfection of AC-1 cells with a plasmid
encoding for FLAG-tagged-CPI-17 demonstrated anti-
body speciﬁcity. In conclusion, the CPI-17 antibodies
C1 and A20 detected two distinct proteins at 17 kDa,
which correspond to the dephosphorylated and phos-
phorylated form of CPI-17 [8] (Figure 1a). Because the
A20 antibody showed additional unspeciﬁc protein
detection at approximately 27 kDa (not shown), we
applied the monoclonal C1 antibody for all subsequent
histopathological analysis.

To evaluate the C1 antibody for immunohistochem-
istry, we stained adult mouse kidneys for CPI-17 and
found speciﬁc staining in vascular smooth muscle cells,
as described earlier [8] (Figure 1b). Importantly, the C1
antibody signal on histological
sections of CPI-17
knock-out mice was, as expected, absent in the kidney
(Figure 1b).

In human histopathological sections, blood vessels
were always CPI-17 positive and served as internal posi-
tive control for all cases (Figure 1c, sural nerve biopsy).
In 28 nontumour samples of the peripheral nervous sys-
tem, no CPI-17 expression other than in vascular
smooth muscle was observed (Figure 1c). In particular,
there was no up-regulation in inﬂammatory pathologies
like chronic demyelinating inﬂammatory neuropathy
(CIDP) (n = 3), vasculitis (n = 3), or traumatic neuro-
mas (n = 15), compared to normal sural biopsies.

NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumours,
intraneural nodular plexiform neuroﬁbroma and der-
mal neuroﬁbroma stained negative for CPI-17. Further,
NF1-associated MPNST did not
express CPI-17

expressed smooth muscle actin (malignant Triton
tumour) (not shown). In two cases of hybrid-tumours

the ones that presented with schwannoma morphology,
expressed CPI-17 (Figure 1c).

In contrast to the aforementioned tissues, the vast
majority of schwannomas (39/43) expressed CPI-17
(Figure 1c). The labelling frequently appeared patchy
and varied in intensity; especially in NF2-associated
tumours, which showed a signiﬁcantly lower median

labelling intensity than sporadic schwannomas (Fig-
ure 1d; P < 0.02 Mann–Whitney-test).
Schwanno-
matosis-associated tumours demonstrated expression
levels between sporadic and NF2-associated schwanno-
mas (Figure 1c,d). Interestingly, spinal ganglion cells,
like neuronal elements in a ganglioneuroma, did not
express CPI-17 (Figure 1c).

CPI-17 was predominantly found in the nucleus,
which is in line with previous reports [10]. We therefore
hypothesized that its expression correlates with cellular
proliferation. In order to test the proliferative effect of
CPI-17 expression in schwannoma,
the proliferation
index was assessed in all schwannomas by labelling with
Ki-67 antibodies (Figure 1f). High CPI-17 levels (staining
intensity > 2) in schwannomas were found to correlate
with higher Ki-67 proliferation indices (Figure 1e).

Apart from a number of studies addressing CPI-17
function in vascular smooth muscle cells in pig and
mice [5,11],
the physiological expression pattern of
CPI-17 in other tissues has not been investigated sys-
tematically. Here, we show that CPI-17 is absent in
resident, normal human peripheral nervous tissue as
well as in nontumour pathologies of the PNS. However,
we now provide evidence that the putative oncogene
CPI-17 is speciﬁcally up-regulated in the tumour entity
‘schwannoma’.

lysates from human arachnoidal cells (AC-1, negative control), but in positive control lysates (AC-1 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged
CPI-17 and RPM-MC cells which express endogenous CPI-17). (b) CPI-17 antibody staining on parafﬁn-embedded kidney slices from wild-
type (left side) or CPI-17 knock-out mice (right side); smooth muscle cells in blood vessels are intensively stained with CPI-17 (C1)
antibody in wild-type (black arrow), but not in CPI-17 knock-out tissue; scale bar 200 lm. (c) CPI-17 is expressed in schwannomas, but
not in other peripheral nervous system tumours or nontumour pathology. All specimens were primarily diagnosed by two
neuropathologists of the Institute of Neuropathology according to current WHO criteria. The biopsies comprised 30 sporadic
schwannomas, three schwannomatosis-associated peripheral schwannomas, 10 NF2-associated peripheral schwannomas, two hybrid-
tumours, one perineurioma, one ganglioneuroma, 49 NF1-associated intraneural plexiform and 47 dermal neuroﬁbromas, 17 NF1-
associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST), 13 sural nerve biopsies with nontumour pathology (three CIDP, seven
noninﬂammatory axonopathies, three cases of vasculitis) and 15 traumatic neuromas. Note physiological expression of CPI-17 in smooth
muscle cells of vessels (arrows). Immunohistochemistry was performed in an automated stainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ,
USA) using a standard antigen retrieval protocol (CPI-17 antibody clone C1, 1:100, pretreatment protocol cc1st). Bound antibodies were
detected by the peroxidase method using diaminobenzidine as chromogen (Ventana Medical Systems, # 760-500). All slides were
counterstained with alum-haematoxylin; scale bar 20 lm. (d) Mean expression levels as scored from antibody labelling intensity of CPI-
17 in sporadic schwannomas (Sporadic schwannomas, n = 30), Schwannomatosis (n = 3), NF2-associated schwannomas (n = 10),
cutaneous neuroﬁbroma (CNF, n = 47), plexiform neuroﬁbroma (PNF, n = 49) and MPNST (n = 17). CPI-17 expression was evaluated
semi-quantitatively using four grades for all tumours (0: no staining, 1: slight to medium labelling of 5–50% of tumour cells, 2: slight to
medium labelling of ≥50% of tumour cells, 3: strong labelling of ≥50% of tumour cells). (e) High expression levels of CPI-17 correlate
with increased Ki-67 proliferative activity in sporadic schwannomas. Samples with no to medium CPI-17 expression (score ≤ 2, black
bar) show signiﬁcantly lower Ki-67 proliferative activity than samples with high CPI-17 expression (score = 3, grey bar). Ki-67
proliferation indices were calculated as percentage of labelled nuclei to all nuclei in 0.1 mm2 of the tumour area with the highest density
of Ki-67 labelled cells (error bars indicate +/  one standard error of the mean). (f) Examples of two sporadic schwannomas with medium
CPI-17 expression and low Ki-67 proliferation index (1.3%, case #122-14) vs. high CPI-17 expression and increased Ki-67 proliferation
index (9.27%, case #357-11); scale bar 20 lm.

Previous

investigations on schwannomas

showed
that 79% of NF2-associated [12], but only 45% [13] to
56% [12] of sporadic schwannomas harbour two muta-
tional hits affecting the NF2 gene. Further, no associa-
tion was found with the type of mutation and relevant
clinical parameters in sporadic tumours [13]. These
data strongly suggest
the involvement of additional
oncogenic pathways, primarily in sporadic schwanno-
mas, but also in NF2-associated tumours. In accor-
dance with this assumption, we found medium or high
expression levels of CPI-17 in 73% (22/30) of sporadic
schwannomas – but in only 20% (2/10) of NF2-asso-
ciated schwannomas (P < 0.02). However, expression
of CPI-17 was evident in over 90% of all schwannomas,
suggesting a role in schwannoma growth in addition to,
or in parallel with, NF2 mutations. In support of this
conclusion, high CPI-17 levels in schwannoma corre-
lated with increased Ki-67 proliferation indices. CPI-17
was frequently localized not only in the cytoplasm but
also, or even exclusively, in the nucleus of tumour cells.
Previously it was suggested that CPI-17 is actively
imported to the nucleus where it inhibits dephosphory-
lation of histone H3, resulting in increased cell prolifera-
tion [10]. Our results indicate a potential role of CPI-17
in schwannoma progression. However, the data did not
sufﬁce to prove a causative function of CPI-17 in
schwannoma pathogenesis
in the absence of NF2
mutations. The latter question could be addressed by
correlation of the NF2 mutational status with the level
of CPI-17 expression.

From a diagnostic perspective, CPI-17 overexpression
in schwannoma is a valuable ﬁnding, since the three
main PNST entities – neuroﬁbroma, schwannoma and
MPNST – show similar antigen expression patterns with
respect to S100 protein, collagen IV, CD34 and Sox10
[14], and may also display overlapping growth patterns.
These similarities may pose problems in the correct diag-
nosis of PNST [14], which in turn is an essential prereq-
uisite for an adequate therapy. Although the treatment
of choice for symptomatic benign and malignant PNST is
surgical excision, medical treatment of schwannomas
with bevacizumab has been shown to procure tumour
regression and improve hearing in NF2-patients with
vestibular schwannoma not eligible for surgery [15].

In conclusion, CPI-17 is not expressed in the healthy
peripheral nervous system or in nontumour pathologies
of the PNS. CPI-17 up-regulation, however, is observed
in over 90% of schwannomas, but not in neuroﬁbroma

and only rarely in MPNST. CPI-17 expression corre-
lates with tumour cell proliferation and because of its
predominant expression in schwannoma, CPI-17 is pro-
posed as a promising diagnostic marker differentiating
between schwannoma and other PNST or nontumour
peripheral nerve lesions.
