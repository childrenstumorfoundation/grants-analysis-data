This effect may be more pronounced in mice
than in humans, where LOH events are typ-
ically subchromosomal. Still, closely linked
mutations that act synergistically or antago-
nistically could strongly affect the process of
human tumor development
through this
mechanism.

Finally, we anticipate that both models
will be critical in further characterization of
tumorigenic mechanisms in NF1 and in the
evaluation of potential
therapies, such as
compounds designed to inhibit Ras signaling,
such as farnesyl transferase inhibitors (27).

Mouse Tumor Model for
Neuro(cid:222)bromatosis Type 1

Kristine S. Vogel,1*† Laura J. Klesse,1* Susana Velasco-Miguel,1*

Neuro(cid:222)bromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder charac-
terized by increased incidence of benign and malignant tumors of neural crest
origin. Mutations that activate the protooncogene ras, such as loss of Nf1,
cooperate with inactivating mutations at the p53 tumor suppressor gene during
malignant transformation. One hundred percent of mice harboring null Nf1 and
p53 alleles in cis synergize to develop soft tissue sarcomas between 3 and 7
months of age. These sarcomas exhibit loss of heterozygosity at both gene loci
and express phenotypic traits characteristic of neural crest derivatives and
human NF1 malignancies.

Mutations in tumor suppressor genes are com-
mon events in human cancers (1). Individuals
with a mutation in one copy of the NF1 gene
develop benign cutaneous neurofibromas, plex-
iform neurofibromas, cafe´-au-lait spots, and ax-
illary freckling (2). Through loss of heterozy-
gosity (LOH) at the NF1 locus, patients with
neurofibromatosis type 1 are at increased risk of
developing malignancies of neural crest deriv-
atives,
including malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (MPNSTs), malignant Triton tu-
mors (MTTs), and pheochromocytomas (2, 3).
MPNSTs and MTTs arise from plexiform neu-
rofibromas and frequently are associated with
mutation or loss of the p53 tumor suppressor
gene (2, 4). The protein product of the NF1
gene neurofibromin is a guanosine triphos-
phatase (GTPase)–activating protein (GAP)
that can negatively regulate p21ras signaling
(5). Mutations that activate Ras cooperate with
mutations that inactivate p53 in a number of

transformation assays and models of tumori-
genesis (6).

The Nf1 and p53 genes are linked in humans
and in mice (7). To determine whether null
mutations in Nf1 and p53 cooperate to acceler-
ate tumorigenesis in vivo, we generated a re-
combinant mouse strain harboring inactivated
Nf1 and p53 alleles linked on mouse chromo-
some 11. We accomplished this with inter-
crosses of trans-Nf11/2:p531/2 compound het-
erozygotes or through crosses with p531/2 het-
erozygotes. The integrity of the recombinant
cis-Nf1:p53 chromosome was established by
genomic Southern blot analysis and by poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR). All progeny of
cis-Nf11/2:p531/2 test crosses to wild-type an-
imals were either compound heterozygotes or
entirely wild type, which confirms the integrity
of the double-mutant chromosome.

Mice that are heterozygous for the Nf1 mu-
tation alone are at increased risk of developing
pheochromocytomas and myeloid leukemias
between 18 and 28 months of age (8). Loss of
one or both copies of the p53 gene leads to
accelerated tumorigenesis. Thus, p532/2 mice
develop lymphomas and hemangiosarcomas by
6 months of age, whereas p531/2 mice exhibit
a predominance of osteosarcomas that arise lat-
er, after 9 months (9). We compared the mor-
tality of trans- and cis-Nf11/2:p531/2 com-
pound heterozygotes with that of p531/2 and

p532/2 mice on a mixed C57BL/6/129sv back-
ground (Fig. 1A). In addition, we analyzed
survival of the null p53 genotype together with
Nf1 heterozygosity (cis-Nf11/2:p532/2). In-
troduction of one null Nf1 allele accelerated
tumor formation and mortality in the context of
both the p531/2 and the p532/2 backgrounds
(Fig. 1A). Both cis- and trans-Nf1:p53 mice
developed tumors (primarily sarcomas) and
died at 15 and 25 weeks, respectively, whereas
the p531/2 mice survived beyond 37 weeks of
age. Similarly, Nf11/2:p532/2 mice began to
develop tumors (primarily lymphomas) and die
as early as 3 weeks of age, whereas p532/2
mice did not develop lymphomas before 18
weeks. Mice homozygous for the p53 and the
Nf1 mutations are embryonic lethal and exhibit
a high incidence of exencephaly (10).

To determine whether LOH had occurred at
both loci in the cis-Nf1:p53 tumors, we used
PCR-based assays to identify the wild-type and
neo-disrupted alleles (9, 11). As shown in Fig.
1B, 22 of 31 (71%) of the soft tissue sarcomas
exhibited LOH at both loci; however, this may
be an underestimate because of the difficulties
of isolating pure tumor cells from surrounding
normal tissue. Lymphomas isolated from trans-
Nf11/2:p531/2 and cis-Nf11/2:p532/2 mice
did not exhibit LOH at the Nf1 locus (Fig. 1B,
tumor 4).

To determine whether introduction of the
Nf1 mutation altered the tumor spectrum in
cis-Nf1:p53 mice, we examined the pathologi-
cal and phenotypic characteristics of the tu-
mors. Histological analysis revealed that the
cis-Nf11/2:p531/2 mice exhibited a significant
incidence of soft tissue sarcomas that appeared
to be malignant based on their dedifferentiated
morphology, disrupted tissue organization, and
increased number of mitotic figures. Of 66
characterized tumors, 51 (77%) were sarcomas,
9 (14%) were lymphomas, 10 (8%) were car-
cinomas, and 2 were neuroblastomas. We sub-
jected the soft tissue sarcomas to further anal-
yses with antibodies specific for myoglobin,
desmin, S100, and smooth muscle markers. On
the basis of histopathological criteria and im-
munohistochemical analysis, we classified 11
tumors as MTTs, 31 as MPNSTs, 2 as leiomy-
osarcomas, 5 as rhabdomyosarcomas, and 4 as
malignant fibrohistiocytomas (Fig. 1C). At least
3 of these malignant
tumor types—MTTs,
MPNSTs, and leiomysarcomas—occur with
increased frequency in human NF1 patients (2).
Thus, the presence of the Nf1 mutation, which
alone is weakly tumorigenic, accelerates tumor-
igenesis and alters the tumor spectrum in the
context of the p531/2 background.

Although NF1 is generally considered to
be a neoplastic disorder of neural crest– de-
rived cells, certain malignancies (rhabdomy-
osarcomas, leiomyosarcomas) have been as-
sociated with a mesodermal, rather than a
neuroectodermal, origin (2). To address the
origin of NF1 malignancies, we established

crest and Schwann cell markers (12), includ-
ing the transcription factor Pax-3, the low-
affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor
p75, cell adhesion molecules N-CAM and
L1, GAP-43, and the calcium binding protein
S100. Many of
lines expressed
mRNAs characteristic of more differentiated
Schwann cells, including Krox-20 and the
myelin-specific proteins P0 and myelin basic
protein (12). In addition to these glial mark-
ers, the MT T lines expressed mRNAs char-
acteristic of myogenic differentiation, includ-
ing desmin, MyoD, SM-22, and calponin
(12). Immunocytochemical and immunoblot
analyses also demonstrated expression of
p75, S100, GFAP, GAP-43, smooth muscle
actin (SMA), calponin, neurofilament, and
peripherin proteins in many of the cis-Nf1:
p53 tumor cell lines (Table 1). Tumor cell
lines isolated from p532/2 sarcomas did not
express proteins characteristic of Schwann
cell or neuronal differentiation in these assays
(Table 1). Taken together, these data suggest
that cis-Nf1:p53 cell lines derive from a neu-
ral crest stem cell that can follow Schwann
cell, smooth muscle, or autonomic neuronal
differentiation pathways (13). Thus, although
the sarcomas that arise in cis-Nf1:p53 mice
may differ in precise pathological classifica-
tion, molecular analyses of the tumor cell
lines are consistent with a common neural
crest, rather than mesodermal, origin.

Generation of mouse mutants at suspected

tumor suppressor loci has provided important
information about the underlying mechanisms
of tumor formation (14). It has therefore been
perplexing that the original knockouts of the
Nf1 gene, modeled after the most frequently
observed genetic neoplastic disorder in humans,
did not afford a useful model for the benign
neurofibromas or the malignant neurofibrosar-
comas in NF1 patients (8, 11). A possible ex-
planation is that the period of embryonic devel-
opment, cell differentiation, and growth is sig-
nificantly reduced in the mouse. This temporal
difference may shorten the window of opportu-
nity for acquisition of additional mutations
within a given cell or reduce the size of the
target cell population. Our data, and those of
Cichowski and colleagues (15), indicate that an
additional mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor
gene is required to predispose Nf11/2 mouse
neural crest–derived cells to malignant trans-
formation. Moreover, our molecular and im-
munochemical
evidence
that NF1-associated rhabdomyosarcomas and
leiomyosarcomas may be of neural crest origin
and provide a possible explanation for the de-
velopment of MTTs. Cell lines isolated from
MTTs express both Schwann cell and smooth
muscle markers, often in the same tumor cell
(16). The phenotype of these tumors is consis-
tent with immortalization of a pluripotent neu-
ral crest stem cell, which under normal circum-
stances adopts a glial, smooth muscle, or neu-
ronal fate (13). Throughout development and

analyses provide

17. Nf11/2:p531/2 and Nf11/2:p532/2 progeny of trans-
Nf11/2:p531/2 crosses were bred with mice that were
wild type at both loci. A founder male with the geno-
type Nf11/2:p532/2 proved to harbor a stable recom-
binant chromosome 11 after test crosses to three wild-
type females. The recombinant (cis con(cid:222)guration) chro-
mosome was maintained on a mixed C57B6/129sv
background, as were mice of other genotypes used for
mortality studies. For genotyping, tail DNA was subject-
ed to two separate three-primer PCRs, one for Nf1 (11)
and one for p53 (8). Samples of macroscopically recog-
nizable tumor were (cid:222)xed in 10% buffered formalin,
embedded in paraf(cid:222)n, and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin. All immunostaining was done at room tem-
perature on a BioTek Solutions Techmate automated
immunostainer (Ventana BioTek Systems, Tucson, AZ ).
Buffers, blocking solutions, secondary antibodies, avi-
din-biotin complex reagents, chromogen, and hematox-
ylin counterstain were used as supplied in the Chem-
Mate secondary detection kit (Ventana BioTek Sys-
tems). Optimum primary antibody dilutions were pre-
determined with known positive control tissues. A
known positive control section was included in each run
to ensure proper staining. Paraf(cid:222)n sections were cut at
3 mm on a rotary microtome and mounted on positive-

ly charged glass slides (POP100 capillary gap slides;
Ventana BioTek Systems) at pH 6.8. Sections were
incubated in unlabeled blocking antibody solution for 5
to 10 min to block nonspeci(cid:222)c binding of secondary
antibody and then incubated for 25 min with either
primary antibody (S100 protein; SMA, 1:400; myoglo-
bin, 1:60,000; desmin, 1:100; DAKO, Carpenteria, CA)
or with buffer alone as a negative reagent control. After
washing in buffer, sections were incubated for 25 min
with biotinylated polyvalent secondary antibody solu-
tion (containing goat antibodies to rabbit, mouse, and
rat immunoglobulin). After another buffer wash, sec-
tions were incubated with three changes, 2.5 min each,
of 3% H2O2 to inhibit endogenous tissue peroxidase
activity and again washed in buffer. Sections were then
incubated for 25 min with freshly prepared horseradish
peroxidase—conjugated avidin-biotin complex. Sections
were then washed in buffer and incubated with three
changes, 5 min each, of a freshly prepared mixture of
diaminobenzidine (DAB) and H2O2 in buffer, followed
by washing in buffer and then water. Sections were
then counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in a
graded series of ethanols and xylene, and coverslipped.
Slides were reviewed by light microscopy. Positive re-
actions with DAB were identi(cid:222)ed as a dark brown
reaction product. Sections were photographed on a
Nikon Optiphot microscope (Nikon Instruments,
Melville, NY ).

18. Characterization of soft tissue sarcomas in cis-Nf1:p53
mice. Histopathological examination was performed on
all tumors obtained from animals at the termination of
the experiment. Soft tissue tumors were classi(cid:222)ed in
accordance with 1994 World Health Organization crite-
ria. Tumor masses were removed under sterile condi-
tions and measured. Small pieces of tumor tissue were
removed for histological processing, DNA isolation, and
establishment of tumor cell lines. Tumor samples were
(cid:222)xed in either Bouin(cid:213)s (cid:222)xative (for hematoxylin and
eosin staining) or 10% formalin (for immunohistochem-
istry) and processed for paraf(cid:222)n embedding and section-
ing at 5 to 7 mm. Tumor sections were immunostained
with S100 antibody (anti-S100) (Novocastra), anti-
desmin (Signet), anti-a-actin (Boehringer), or anti-myo-
globin (Signet) and visualized by the Vectastain Elite ABC
peroxidase method (Vector). Tumor DNA was geno-
typed by three-primer PCRs as described above.

19. Nf1/p53 tumor-derived cell

lines were isolated as
follows: Overlying skin and hair were removed from

the tumor mass and then the tumor mass immersed
brie(cid:223)y in Dulbecco(cid:213)s phosphate-buffered saline and in
a solution of penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco).
Small pieces of the tumor mass were minced in
Dulbecco(cid:213)s modi(cid:222)ed Eagle(cid:213)s medium (DMEM) [sup-
plemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf se-
rum (HIFCS), penicillin and streptomycin, and nones-
sential amino acids] (Gibco) with watchmaker(cid:213)s for-
ceps and (cid:222)ne curved scissors. Tumor pieces were
allowed to attach to 60-mm plastic tissue culture
dishes, and clonal cell lines were established from
tumor outgrowths after four to six passages.

20. For immunocytochemistry, tumor cells grown on cov-
erslips in 2% HIFCS/DMEM were (cid:222)xed in 4% parafor-
maldehyde and exposed to antibodies diluted overnight
at 4¡C as follows: p75 (Chemicon), 1:200; c-neu (Santa
Cruz), 1:200; GAP-43, 1:250; S100 (Novocastra),
1:200; GFAP (Santa Cruz), 1:200; SMA (Sigma), 1:400;
calponin (Sigma), 1:400; neuro(cid:222)lament (Chemicon),
1:200. To visualize bound antibody, we used Vectastain
Elite ABC peroxidase kits (Vector Laboratories), speci(cid:222)c
for goat, rabbit, or mouse primary antibodies, according
to the manufacturer(cid:213)s instructions. We also tested all
primary antibodies with Cy3- or (cid:223)uorescein isothiocya-
nate—conjugated (cid:223)uorescent
secondary antibodies
(Chemicon, Sigma) to determine which method yielded
little or no background staining. For immunoblots, pro-
teins were extracted from tumor cells grown in 162-
cm2 culture (cid:223)asks in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer contain-
ing protease inhibitors (Sigma). Insoluble (SMA, GFAP)
and soluble (c-neu, S100) fractions were subjected to
SDS—polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% to 10%
minigels. After protein transfer, nitrocellulose mem-
branes were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in
tris-buffered saline and incubated with primary anti-
body overnight at 4¡C. Speci(cid:222)c protein bands were
visualized with Vectastain Elite ABC peroxidase kits
(Vector Laboratories), or with Immun-Star kits (Bio-
Rad), according to the manufacturers(cid:213) instructions.

Microarray Analysis of

Drosophila Development During

Metamorphosis

Kevin P. White,* Scott A. Rifkin,† Patrick Hurban,‡

David S. Hogness

Metamorphosis is an integrated set of developmental processes controlled by
a transcriptional hierarchy that coordinates the action of hundreds of genes. In
order to identify and analyze the expression of these genes, high-density DNA
microarrays containing several thousand Drosophila melanogaster gene se-
quences were constructed. Many differentially expressed genes can be assigned
to developmental pathways known to be active during metamorphosis, whereas
others can be assigned to pathways not previously associated with metamor-
phosis. Additionally, many genes of unknown function were identi(cid:222)ed that may
be involved in the control and execution of metamorphosis. The utility of this
genome-based approach is demonstrated for studying a set of complex bio-
logical processes in a multicellular organism.

The generation of vast amounts of DNA se-
quence information, coupled with advances
in technologies developed for the experimen-
tal use of such information, allows the de-

scription of biological processes from a glob-
al genetic perspective. One such technology,
DNA microarrays, permits the simultaneous
monitoring of thousands of genes (1). DNA
