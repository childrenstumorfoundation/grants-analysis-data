The ‘RASopathies’ are a group of disorders sharing many clinical features
and a common pathophysiology. In this study, we aimed to clinically
evaluate a group of Turkish patients and elucidate the underlying genetic
etiology. Thirty-one patients with a clinical diagnosis of one of the
RASopathy syndromes were included in the study. Of these, 26 (83.8%)
had a clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome, whereas 5 had a clinical
diagnosis of either Costello, LEOPARD or cardio-facio-cutaneous
syndromes. Twenty of 31 (64.5%) patients were found to be mutation
positive. Mutations in PTPN11, SOS1 and SHOC2 genes were detected in
patients with Noonan syndrome (57.6%). Mutations in MEK1, PTPN11,
BRAF and HRAS genes were detected in the remaining. Pulmonary
stenosis was the most common (61.5%) cardiac anomaly. Among Noonan
syndrome patients with a conﬁrmed mutation, mild intellectual disability
tended to be more common in patients with PTPN11 mutation than in
those with SOS1 mutation. Hematologic evaluation revealed coagulation
defects in three Noonan syndrome patients with a mutation. This is
currently the largest clinical and molecular study in Turkish RASopathy
patients. Our ﬁndings indicate that molecular epidemiology and
genotype–phenotype correlations in RASopathies are relatively
independent from the ethnic population background.

Recent genetic studies have showed that Noonan syn-
drome (NS) and related disorders (now collectively
called ‘RASopathies’) are caused by germline muta-
tions in a number of genes interacting in the same
Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (1–3).
The overlapping clinical features, wide spectrum of
phenotypic expression within each trait, and the absence

of clinical features with pathognomonic value and
consensus on diagnostic criteria can make diagnosis
of NS and related disorders challenging (4). There-
fore, molecular analysis has become an important key
for the veriﬁcation of clinical diagnosis and estab-
lishment of
follow-up plans. The most
consistent genotype–phenotype correlations that have

individual

been conﬁrmed in independent cohorts are: PTPN11,
KRAS, SOS, RAF1, and NRAS gene mutations in
NS (1); SHOC2 gene mutations in NS-like disorder
with loose anagen hair (1); CBL gene mutations in dis-
order with variable NS-like features and propensity to
JMML (1); HRAS gene mutations in Costello syndrome
(CS) (5); speciﬁc PTPN11 gene mutations in LEOP-
ARD syndromes (LS) (6, 7); BRAF, KRAS, MEK1,
MEK2 gene mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC)
syndrome (1, 8, 9). Studies on clinical features and
molecular etiology of RASopathy syndromes in addi-
tional cohorts with various ethnic background will
contribute not only to our understanding of clinical
variability and molecular epidemiology but also to
reﬁnement of genotype–phenotype correlations in these
disorders.

Materials and methods

Clinical evaluation

Clinical diagnosis of NS was made according to the
NS scoring system (10), whereas for CFC Kavamura
index was utilized (11). All patients were examined
by experienced clinical dysmorphologists (Y. A. and
K. B.). Ethical approval and informed consent were
received from patients or their legal guardians. Anthro-
pometric measurements, cardiovascular evaluation with
echocardiography and cardiac catheterization when nec-
essary, hematological evaluation including total blood
count, peripheral blood smear and coagulation param-
eters (aPTT, INR, vWF, FII, FV, FVII-FXIII levels),
hearing assessment and psychometric evaluation using
Stanford–Binet test and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children-Revised (WISC-R) in 2–6 and 6–16 years of
age of patients, respectively were performed.

Molecular screening

DNA from patients and their parents were extracted
from peripheral blood lymphocytes by using standard
extraction procedures. National Center for Biotechnol-
ogy Information (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
was used to obtain gene information. All exons har-
boring known mutations in Noonan, CFC, Costello
and LEOPARD syndromes were analyzed for each
gene studied. Initially the genes PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS,
RAF1, SHOC2, NRAS and CBL were analyzed for
patients with NS and LS. For this purpose exons
and ﬂanking intronic regions of the genes includ-
ing PTPN11 Exons 2–4, 7, 8, 11–14 (NM_002834),
RAF1 Exons 7, 12, 14, 17 (NM_002880), KRAS iso-
form B Exon 2, 3, 5 (NM_004985), SOS1 Exons
3–11, 13,14, 16 (NM_005633), SHOC2 Exon 2 par-
tial (NM_007373), NRAS Exons 2, 3 (NM_002524),
CBL Exons 7–9 (NM_005188) were ampliﬁed by PCR
and analyzed by high resolution melting on a Light
Cycler (Roche, LC-480; Roche Diagnostics, Grenzach-
Wyhlen, Germany). Oligonucleotide primer sequences
and PCR protocols are available on request. Melt-
ing graphs were compared using the Light Cycler

182

480 Gene Scanning Software (Roche). The curves
differing from the wild type, indicated samples with
mutation. For variants from standard curves, the PCR
products were then puriﬁed and sequenced using
an automated capillary sequencer. Sequence analy-
sis was performed using 3500xl Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For the patient
with a clinical diagnosis of CS only the HRAS
(NM_005343) gene was analyzed using bidirectional
sequencing. Patients with negative results upon high
resolution melting (HRM)
screening and targeted
sequencing were subsequently sequenced for the genes
BRAF (NM_004333), MEK1 (NM_002755), MEK2
(NM_030662) and HRAS as well as the remaining
exons of PTPN11.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis of clinical ﬁndings of patients with
mutation vs patients without mutation was performed
at Hacettepe University Ihsan Dogramaci Children’s
Hospital using spss version 19.0, with a statistical
signiﬁcance set at p < 0.05.

Results

Clinical evaluation

Craniofacial features and a summary of clinical ﬁndings
of mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients are
shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, respectively. In total, 31
patients with a suspected RASopathy were included in
the study. Of these, 26 (83.8%) had a clinical diagnosis
of NS. The remaining patients had two Costello,
two LEOPARD and one CFC diagnoses. Overall, 27
patients were sporadic; however, four cases had a
parent with suggestive features of NS. Audiological
assessment was performed and found to be normal in
10 patients with NS. Hematologic evaluation revealed
thrombocytopenia in a mutation-negative patient who
is still under investigation and thrombocyte aggregation
abnormality in three patients each with a mutation in
one of the three genes (SOS1, PTPN11 and SHOC2 )
and in two other patients with no mutation.

Mutation screening

All exons of PTPN11, SOS1, SHOC2, RAF1, KRAS,
BRAF, MEK1, MEK2, HRAS, NRAS and CBL genes
harboring known mutations in Noonan, CFC, Costello
and LEOPARD syndromes were analyzed. We identi-
ﬁed heterozygous point mutations in 20 of 31 patients
with an overall detection rate of 64.5% (Table 2). Muta-
tions were detected in 16 (80%) sporadic patients and
in 4 (20%) patients with a family history of RASopa-
thy. The remaining patients were negative regarding
PTPN11, SOS1, SHOC2, RAF1, KRAS, BRAF, MEK1,
MEK2, HRAS, NRAS and CBL mutations. All of the
detected mutations in this study have been previously
described as causative changes for NS and related dis-
orders (5, 6, 8, 12–17).

Discussion

In this report, we describe our RASopathy patients
both clinically and molecularly. Heterozygous point
mutations were identiﬁed in 20 of 31 patients, most
of which represented sporadic cases, probably due to
de novo mutations. NS was conﬁrmed in 58% of
patients whereas LEOPARD and CFC syndromes were
conﬁrmed molecularly in all presumed patients. In two
patients with CS, one was found to have a BRAF
mutation (Exon 12: c.1495A>G), therefore, changing
the diagnosis to CFC syndrome whereas the other
one was found to have a HRAS (Exon 2: c.35G>C)
mutation conﬁrming the clinical diagnosis.

The majority of patients with NS had PTPN11
mutations while SOS1 and SHOC2 mutations were also
detected. The lack of RAF1 mutations and the apparent
over representation of SHOC2 mutations is most likely
a bias due to relatively small size of the cohort.

Mutations in PTPN11, the ﬁrst described and pre-
dominant gene in NS (13), are reported in 33–50% of
patients in literature. In this study, 27% of patients with
NS had PTPN11 mutations which were almost exclu-
sively present in Exons 3 and 8. Interestingly, Exon 8
mutation (c.922A>G) previously described as the most
common mutation in NS (12) was not detected in any
of our patients.

SOS1 mutations are known to cause NS in about 20%
of affected individuals without PTPN11 mutations (13,
14). SOS1 mutation detection rate in our cohort was
19% and all except one were sporadic. Phenotypically

patients with SOS1 mutation often present with ectoder-
mal abnormalities with normal stature, growth and intel-
lectual development (14, 15, 18). Such a trend could
also be reproduced in our cohort which was, however,
too small for statistical signiﬁcance.

SHOC2 mutations have only recently been reported
among genes responsible for a recognizable subtype of
NS (16). A unique feature of the SHOC2 mutation is its
association with ‘loose anagen hair’ (1). In this study,
the recurrent SHOC2 mutation p.S2G was detected in
three NS patients. All displayed loose anagen hair phe-
notype. One of them had systemic lupus erythematosis
(SLE). However, the causal interrelationships remain
speculative and more systematic studies and long-term
follow-up data are needed to clarify the possible asso-
ciation.

CFC shows considerable phenotypic overlap with
Noonan and Costello syndromes, especially in young
children (19). Patients with CFC syndrome most fre-
quently have BRAF or MEK mutations, whereas spe-
ciﬁc HRAS mutations are regarded as deﬁnitive for
CS (20, 21). In our cohort, one of the two patients with
a clinical diagnosis of CS was found to have a BRAF
mutation (Exon 12: c.1495A>G) leading to a change
in diagnosis toward CFC syndrome.

The most common congenital heart disease in
NS is pulmonary valve stenosis with dysplastic
leaﬂets (22, 23). Prevalence of pulmonary stenosis in
NS patients with PTPN11 mutations is reported to be
as high as 74% (24). In this study, 71.4% of patients

with NS had pulmonary valve stenosis. Hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy was a rare ﬁnding among PTPN11
and SOS1 mutation positive NS patients in our cohort,
which was a parallel ﬁnding with the lack of RAF1
mutations.

In this study, mutation detection rate in patients
with Noonan and CFC syndromes is not signiﬁcantly
different from previous reports (8, 12, 13). We were
unable to identify the molecular cause in about 35% of
our patients with NS but we believe that these patients
still have this syndrome, yet
through undiscovered
genes and mutations. This study might have had
minor limitations because of the fact that for some
genes, only selected exons were screened for mutations.
However, this selection included all exons in which
germline mutations have been described, to date. As
RASopathy-associated mutations have been shown to
cause gain-of-function and cluster in speciﬁc domains
of the gene products (5, 6, 8, 12–17),
the chosen
approach is very unlikely to miss a relevant number of
mutations. The variations detected in our cohort were
very heterogeneous. Therefore, a statistically signiﬁcant
comparison between patients with speciﬁc genotypes
could not be made.

In conclusion, this is the largest Turkish cohort of
patients with RASopathies. We found that mutation
spectrum and phenotypic expressions are not signiﬁ-
cantly different from cohorts with other ethnic back-
ground. We found an interesting association of SLE
with a SHOC2 mutation. More subtle phenotype associ-
ations and differences in molecular epidemiology would
require much larger cohorts.
