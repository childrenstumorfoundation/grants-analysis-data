Abstract

Purpose: We describe the preclinical pharmacology and antitumor activity of GDC-0068, a novel highly
selective ATP-competitive pan-Akt inhibitor currently in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers.
Experimental Design: The effect of GDC-0068 on Akt signaling was characterized using speciﬁc
biomarkers of the Akt pathway, and response to GDC-0068 was evaluated in human cancer cell lines and
xenograft models with various genetic backgrounds, either as a single agent or in combination with
chemotherapeutic agents.

Results: GDC-0068 blocked Akt signaling both in cultured human cancer cell lines and in tumor
xenograft models as evidenced by dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of downstream targets.
Inhibition of Akt activity by GDC-0068 resulted in blockade of cell-cycle progression and reduced viability
of cancer cell lines. Markers of Akt activation, including high-basal phospho-Akt levels, PTEN loss, and
PIK3CA kinase domain mutations, correlate with sensitivity to GDC-0068. Isogenic PTEN knockout also
sensitized MCF10A cells to GDC-0068. In multiple tumor xenograft models, oral administration of GDC-
0068 resulted in antitumor activity ranging from tumor growth delay to regression. Consistent with the role
of Akt in a survival pathway, GDC-0068 also enhanced antitumor activity of classic chemotherapeutic
agents.

Conclusions: GDC-0068 is a highly selective, orally bioavailable Akt kinase inhibitor that shows
pharmacodynamic inhibition of Akt signaling and robust antitumor activity in human cancer cells in vitro
and in vivo. Our preclinical data provide a strong mechanistic rationale to evaluate GDC-0068 in cancers
with activated Akt signaling. Clin Cancer Res; 19(7); 1760–72. Ó2012 AACR.

Introduction

The serine/threonine kinase Akt (a.k.a. protein kinase B
or PKB) is encoded by 3 closely related genes in humans,
Akt1 (PKB-a), Akt2 (PKB-b), and Akt3 (PKB-g), that belong
to the AGC family of kinases and share high homology with
protein kinase A (PKA) and PKC. Akt is the central node of
the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway and is negatively regulated
by the tumor suppressor PTEN, a phospholipid phospha-
tase that counteracts the activity of phosphoinositide 3-
kinase (PI3K). The products of PI3K activity, the lipid

second messengers phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trispho-
sphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] and PI(3,4)P2, promote membrane
association and activation of Akt. Akt is phosphorylated at
2 residues critical for its full activation: a threonine residue
in the activation loop of the kinase domain (T308) by
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and a serine
residue within the hydrophobic motif of the regulatory
domain (S473) that can be phosphorylated by a number
of kinases, most prominently mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2;
reviewed in ref. 1). Activated Akt phosphorylates and reg-
ulates the functions of numerous cellular proteins, includ-
ing the FoxO proteins, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), and
S6 kinase, thereby playing an essential role in cell prolifer-
ation, survival, growth, migration, and energy metabolism
(2).

Activation of Akt constitutes a hallmark of a variety of
human cancers (3, 4). Multiple mechanisms can lead to Akt
activation in human cancers, among which the most fre-
quent genetic alterations include loss of the tumor suppres-
sor PTEN (5, 6), and mutational activation of the p110a
catalytic subunit of PI3K (7, 8). Ampliﬁcation of the genes
encoding either Akt or PI3K has also been observed in a
subset of human cancers (9, 10). In addition, mutations in

Translational Relevance

Activation of Akt constitutes a hallmark of a variety
of human cancers. Despite signiﬁcant progress in iden-
tifying small-molecule inhibitors against Akt, selecti-
vity proﬁles and dose-limiting toxicities of previously
reported Akt inhibitors have raised concerns about their
safety and mechanisms of action. GDC-0068 is a novel
ATP-competitive Akt inhibitor currently in clinical trials.
With impressive selectivity, GDC-0068 offers both a
valuable tool to dissect Akt downstream signaling and
cellular effects and a promising therapeutic agent to
interrogate our hypotheses in the clinic. Consistent with
its high selectivity and speciﬁc targeting of activated Akt,
GDC-0068 not only shows dose-dependent inhibition
of Akt signaling and robust antitumor activity, but also
exhibits differential activity in cells with and without
activated Akt signaling that is distinct from phosphoi-
nositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. These preclinical
data suggest that a rational strategy can be applied to
stratify patients likely to beneﬁt in clinical trials with a
potentially achievable therapeutic index.

Akt1 can result in its constitutive activation in diverse
cancers (11, 12), and has recently been identiﬁed as the
underlying genetic abnormality associated with the Proteus
syndrome (13). Hyperactivation of Akt also occurs via
deregulated signaling of many cell surface receptors, intra-
cellular linkers, and signaling molecules, including ampli-
ﬁcation/mutation of the EGFR/ErbB growth factor receptor
family members and oncogenic mutations in the RAS
family (reviewed in ref. 14). Moreover, Akt activation has
been associated with resistance to both chemotherapeutic
agents and targeted agents (15). These observations make
Akt an attractive target for anticancer drug discovery. The
eventual success of drugs targeting the PI3K–Akt–mTOR
pathway will depend on their therapeutic index and the
ability to stratify patients likely to respond to these
therapeutics.

The 3 isoforms of Akt have both overlapping and distinct
functions and expression proﬁles (16, 17). Activation of all
3 Akt family members have been detected in a variety of
human malignancies, and inducible short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) knockdown studies suggest that inhibition of all
3 Akt isoforms is required for maximum efﬁcacy in PTEN-
deﬁcient cancer xenograft models (18). Strategies for target-
ing Akt have included both ATP-competitive and allosteric
compounds, several of which were or are being tested in
clinical trials (19). Previously reported ATP-competitive
inhibitors have signiﬁcant off-target activity on other mem-
bers of the AGC kinase family (20, 21), therefore challenges
remain for the development of potent and selective inhi-
bitors of Akt that are suitable as drug candidates. Here, we
describe preclinical pharmacology and antitumor activity of
a novel, highly selective, orally available ATP-competitive
pan-Akt inhibitor GDC-0068. We show that GDC-0068

GDC-0068, a Novel Selective ATP-Competitive Akt Inhibitor

inhibits Akt signaling, leading to selective inhibition of
cancer cell viability in a diagnostically deﬁned subset of
human cancer cells characterized by Akt activation. Con-
sistent with the role of Akt in promoting cell survival, GDC-
0068 also enhanced the efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutic agents
such as docetaxel and carboplatin. The antitumor activity
of GDC-0068 was recapitulated in human cancer xeno-
graft models representing a broad spectrum of tumor types.
Our preclinical studies provide a strong mechanistic ratio-
nale for clinical development of GDC-0068 in the treat-
ment of human cancer either as a single agent or in com-
bination with standard of care chemotherapeutic drugs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture



Cell lines were originally obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection or from Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH cell bank and
genotyped by Genentech’s cell banking facility. Lines were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
or RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS at 37
C under 5%
CO2. MCF7-neo/HER2 ectopically expresses HER2 in the
MCF7 parental cell line and was developed at Genentech
(22). MCF10A isogenic cells were obtained from Horizon
Discovery Ltd. (http://www.horizondiscovery.com) and
maintained in MCF10A growth medium as described pre-
viously (23) in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F12 medium
(DMEM–F12) supplemented with 5% horse serum, hydro-
cortisone (0.5 mg/mL), insulin (10 mg/mL), EGF (20 ng/
mL), and 0.1 mg/mL cholera toxin. In cell viability assays,
assay medium containing DMEM-F12 supplemented with
5% horse serum, hydrocortisone (0.5 mg/mL) was supple-
mented with either 20 or 0.2 ng/mL EGF.

Compounds and antibodies

GDC-0068, GDC-0941, and GDC-0980 were supplied
by Genentech, Inc. Antibodies used include phospho-
AktThr308, phospho-AktSer473, Akt, phospho-PRAS40Thr246,
phospho-FoxO1T24/FoxO3T32,
phospho-S6Ser235/236,
phospho-S6Ser240/242, phospho-4EBP1Ser65, S6, PARP,
cleaved PARP, and PTEN from Cell Signaling, a glyceralde-
hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody

were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to generate the
desired stock concentrations then added in a volume of 6 mL
per well. All treatments were tested in quadruplicates. After 4
days incubation, relative numbers of viable cells were
estimated using CellTiter-Glo (Promega) and total lumi-
nescence was measured on a Wallac Multilabel Reader
(PerkinElmer). The concentration of drug resulting in

Protein assays
For immunoblots, cells were washed with cold PBS and
lysed in 1 Cell Extraction Buffer (Biosource) supplemen-
ted with protease inhibitors (Roche), 1 mmol/L phenyl-
methylsulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF), and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktails 1 and 2 from Sigma. Protein concentration was
determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Equal
protein amounts were separated by electrophoresis through
Tris–glycine 4% to 20% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and
proteins transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Pri-
mary antibodies were detected using IR Dye 800-conjugated
(Rockland) and Alexa-Fluoro 680-conjugated (Molecular
Probes) species-selective secondary antibodies. Detection
and quantiﬁcation were conducted using an Odyssey infra-
red scanner (LICOR) using the manufacturer’s software.

Quantitative measurements of phospho and total Akt
were conducted using a Luminex assay (Invitrogen) or a
Meso Scale Discovery Multi-Spot Biomarker Detection Sys-
tem (Meso Scale Discovery). Phospho and total PRAS40
were quantiﬁed using a Luminex assay (Invitrogen) or a
human ELISA kit (Invitrogen). Phospho and total S6 were
quantiﬁed using a Meso Scale Discovery Multi-Spot Bio-
marker Detection System (Meso Scale Discovery).

Flow cytometry assays



For cell-cycle analyses, cells were trypsinized from the
plates, ﬁxed, and permeabilized by slowly dropping into
cold 70% ethanol, then incubated overnight at  20
C. The
cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in PBS
containing 50 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI; Invitrogen)
and 50 mg/mL RNaseA (Novagen) on ice for 30 minutes,
and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Cell-cycle distribution was
determined using the ModFit software (Verity Software
House). To detect apoptosis, cells were resuspended in PBS
containing 4 mmol/L CaCl2, 5% Annexin V -FITC (BD
Pharmingen), and 5 mg/mL PI. The mixture was incubated
on ice for 30 minutes and cells analyzed by ﬂow cytometry
(BD Biosciences).

Xenograft studies

In vivo efﬁcacy was evaluated in multiple tumor cell line-
and patient-derived xenograft models. Cells or tumor frag-
ments were implanted subcutaneously into the ﬂank of
immunocompromised mice. Female or male nude (nu/nu)
or severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice (SCID)/beige
mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Har-
lan Laboratories, or Taconic. For the MCF7-neo/HER2
model, 17b-estradiol pellets (0.36 mg/pellet, 60-day
release, no. SE-121; Innovative Research of America) were
implanted into the dorsal shoulder before cell inoculation.
The LuCaP35V patient-derived primary tumors were
obtained from Dr. Robert Vessella at University of Washing-
ton (Seattle, WA; ref. 24); male mice were castrated before
implantation of tumor fragments. After implantation of

tumor cells or fragments into mice, tumors were monitored
until they reached mean tumor volumes of 180 to 350 mm3
and distributed into groups of 8 to 10 animals/group.
GDC-0068 was formulated in 0.5% methylcellulose/
0.2% Tween-80 (MCT) and administered daily (QD), via
oral (per os; PO) gavage. Docetaxel (Sanoﬁ Aventis) was
formulated in 3% EtOH/97% saline and dosed intra-
venously (IV) every week (QW) at 2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg. Car-
boplatin (St. Mary’s Pharmacy) was formulated in saline
and dosed intraperitoneally (IP) weekly at 50 mg/kg.
Tumor volumes were determined using digital calipers
(Fred V. Fowler Company, Inc.) using the formula (L W 
W)/2. Percentage tumor growth inhibition (%TGI) was
calculated as the percentage of the area under the ﬁtted
curve (AUC) for the respective dose group per day in
relation to the vehicle, such that %TGI ¼ 100  [1  
(AUCtreatment/d)/(AUCvehicle/d)]. Curve ﬁtting was applied
to log2 transformed individual tumor volume data using a
linear mixed-effects (LME) model with the R package nlme,
version 3.1-97 in R v2.13.0 (R Development Core Team
2008; R Foundation for Statistical Computing; ref. 25).
Tumor sizes and body weights were recorded twice weekly
over the course of the study. Mice with tumor volumes
2,000 mm3 or with losses in body weight 20% or more
from their weight at the start of treatment were euthanized
per Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
guidelines.

For pharmacodynamic marker analysis, xenograft tumors
were excised from animals and immediately snap frozen in
dry ice and LN2. Frozen tumors were weighed and processed
using a pestle (Scienceware) in 1 cell extraction buffer.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemisty (IHC) for cleaved caspase-3
(CC3) was carried out using 5-mm parafﬁn sections of
formalin-ﬁxed tissue on a VentanaBenchmark XT instru-
ment (VMSI) by deparafﬁnization, treatment with antigen
retrieval buffer (VMSI) and incubation with anti-CC3 pri-
mary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) at 37
C. Bound
antibody was detected using DABMap technology (VMSI)
and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.



Statistics

Signiﬁcant differences (P values) comparing treatment
data using cell lines with and without evaluated genetic
abnormalities were determined by two-tailed Mann–Whit-
ney test calculated using the JMP statistical software, version
5.1.2 (JMP Software).

Results
GDC-0068 blocked Akt signaling and showed
antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects in
human cancer cell lines

GDC-0068 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of Akt
(Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 26) and is equipotent against
all 3 Akt isoforms, which share more than 95% sequence
identity within the ATP-binding pocket, with potencies
ranging from 5 to 18 nmol/L (Supplementary Table S1).

Because of the high degree of homology in the ATP-
binding pockets among Akt, p70S6K, PKA and other mem-
bers of the AGC family of kinases, selectivity against these
kinases has been a challenge for the development of potent
and speciﬁc Akt inhibitors. GDC-0068 showed more than
600 and more than 100-fold selectivity for Akt1 in IC50
against the closely related kinases PKA and p70S6K, respec-
tively (Supplementary Table S1). When tested at 1 mmol/L
in a panel of 230 protein kinases, which includes 36
human AGC family members, GDC-0068 inhibited only
3 other kinases by more than 70% at 1 mmol/L concentra-
tion (PRKG1a, PRKG1b, and p70S6K). IC50 values mea-
sured for these 3 kinases were 98, 69, and 860 nmol/L,
respectively. Thus, with the exception of PKG1 (relative to
which GDC-0068 is >10-fold more selective for Akt1),
GDC-0068 displays a more than 100-fold selectivity for
Akt1 over the next most potently inhibited non-Akt kinase,
p70S6K, in the screening kinase panel (Supplementary
Table S1; ref. 26).

The biologic activity of GDC-0068 was evaluated in cell-
based assays in vitro. Similar to other ATP-competitive Akt
inhibitors (21, 27, 28), GDC-0068 induced a dose-depen-
dent increase in Akt phosphorylation at both Thr308 (T308)
and Ser473 (S473) residues in all cell lines tested, including
lines in which the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated, such as
PC-3 (PTEN homozygous deletion mutant, prostate),
BT474M1 (PIK3CAK111N mutant and HER2-ampliﬁed,

ovarian; Fig. 1A). As we and others have shown, binding of
the ATP competitive inhibitors to the active site of Akt can
protect these sites from phosphatases, leading to increased
pAkt (29). Despite this increase in pAkt, downstream
Akt signaling activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner as shown by the diminished phosphorylation of
the proline-rich Akt Substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) within
15 minutes of treatment (Fig. 1A). Maximum inhibition
of pPRAS40 was achieved within 1 hour, with IC50 values
of approximately 200 nmol/L in multiple cancer cell
lines (Supplementary Table S1). Phosphorylation of other
downstream targets, such as FoxO1 and FoxO3a, 4EBP1 and
S6, were also inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Fig. 1A and B). Inhibition of pS6, the substrate
of p70S6K that is further downstream of Akt, exhibited a
delayed response compared with the proximal Akt targets,
such as pPRAS40 (Fig. 1B).

The effects of GDC-0068 on cell-cycle progression and
cell death were also assessed in cancer cell lines in which the
PI3K/Akt pathway is activated, including PC-3, BT474M1,
and the MCF7-neo/HER2 (PIK3CAE545K mutant stably
expressing a HER2 transgene) breast cancer cell
lines
(25). A dose-dependent increase in the G0–G1 phase pop-
ulation was observed in all cell lines tested (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S2A). This effect was apparent within 15
hours of treatment and persisted for at least 72 hours in the

GDC-0068, a Novel Selective ATP-Competitive Akt Inhibitor

High Akt activity predicts sensitivity to GDC-0068

Consistent with its effect on cell-cycle progression and
apoptosis, GDC-0068 exhibited dose-dependent inhibition
of overall viability in multiple cancer cell lines (Fig. 3A and
Supplementary Table S2). In a panel of 100 cell lines, we
determined IC50 values on cell viability in response to GDC-
0068. To investigate potential biomarkers that may predict
response to GDC-0068, we also determined baseline
pAktS473 levels in these cell lines, as well as mutational
status of key components in cancer signaling pathways
including loss or mutation of the tumor suppressor PTEN,
mutations in PI3K, ampliﬁcation of HER2, or mutations in
the KRAS or BRAF oncogenes. Sensitivity to GDC-0068 was

strongly associated with pAkt levels above the median value
(P ¼ 1.8  10
 7), and cells with loss of PTEN protein or
genetic mutations in PTEN were also signiﬁcantly more
sensitive to GDC-0068 than those without (P ¼ 7.1 
 5). Cells with PIK3CA mutations did not show signif-
10
icantly increased overall sensitivity to GDC-0068 compared
with PIK3CA wild-type (WT) cells (P ¼ 0.14); however,
mutations in the kinase domain (e.g., H1047R; ref. 8) were
signiﬁcantly associated with increased sensitivity (P ¼
0.002), whereas helical (e.g., E545K) and other domain
(e.g., I391M) mutations did not show signiﬁcant asso-
ciation (P ¼ 0.75). Conversely, mutations in KRAS or

sensitivity with high pAkt or PTEN-deﬁciency was often lost,

or ER

These data are consistent with previous reports that loss of
PTEN strongly correlates with Akt activation (31). Indeed,
higher pAkt levels were signiﬁcantly associated with PTEN
loss or mutation in our panel (mean pAkt levels ¼ 11.44
arbitrary units in PTEN deﬁcient cells vs. 4.85 in others cell
lines; P ¼ 0.00016), and with PIK3CA kinase domain
mutants (mean pAkt levels ¼ 13.32 in kinase domain
mutants vs. 6.32 in all other mutant or WT cell lines; P ¼
0.013) but not with other nonkinase domain PI3K mutants
(mean pAkt levels ¼ 7.63 vs. 6.02 in PIK3CA WT cells; P ¼
0.45). To further determine whether PTEN loss can result in
increased sensitivity to GDC-0068, we evaluated nontrans-
formed human mammary epithelial cells, MCF10A, with
their isogenic PTEN knockout counterparts (23). Cells were
grown in regular MCF10A growth medium, and assayed for
dose–response to GDC-0068 in assay medium containing
either 20 ng/mL EGF or 0.2 ng/mL EGF (low EGF; Fig. 3B).
Although very little pAkt was detectable in the parental
MCF10A cells, Akt phosphorylation at both S473 and T308
were markedly elevated in the PTEN knockout cells under
both conditions, along with increased phosphorylation of
Akt downstream targets such as PRAS40 and S6 (Supple-
mentary Fig. S3). The parental nontransformed MCF10A
cells were quite resistant to GDC-0068 under the high EGF
condition, with only 39% maximum inhibition of viability
at concentrations up to 20 mmol/L of GDC-0068 (Fig. 3B).
Reducing EGF increased sensitivity to 55% maximum inhi-
bition in the parental line. Loss of PTEN resulted in a
leftward shift of the dose–response curves under both
conditions, with maximum inhibitions of 67% and 79%
under high and low EGF conditions, respectively. A greater
than 4-fold decrease in IC50 values was observed under low
EGF conditions in PTEN knockout versus WT cells (1.8 vs.
7.3 mmol/L, respectively), and a greater than 3.5-fold
decrease in IC50 values was observed under high EGF
conditions in PTEN knockout versus WT cells (5.7 vs. >
20 mmol/L, respectively; Fig. 3B).

The strong correlation of GDC-0068 sensitivity with
PTEN loss is in contrast to the previous reports in which
no signiﬁcant correlation with PTEN loss was observed for
sensitivity to other PI3K-targeting inhibitors including the
class I PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (32, 33) and dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor GDC-0980 (25) but is consistent with
another ATP-competitive inhibitor AZD5363 reported
recently (20). We therefore examined the sensitivity of the
MCF10A PTEN isogenic cells to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-
0941 and the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GDC-0980. Both inhi-
bitors were more potent at inhibiting the parental MCF10A
cells than GDC-0068 (Fig. 3B). However, in direct contrast
to GDC-0068, PTEN loss resulted in a 3-fold increase in IC50

GDC-0068, a Novel Selective ATP-Competitive Akt Inhibitor

for GDC-0941 (0.78 vs. 2.3 mmol/L) under high EGF con-
ditions and 2-fold increase (0.20 vs. 0.44 mmol/L) under
low EGF conditions, respectively. Smaller increases in GDC-
0980 IC50 were also observed under both conditions.
Together, these data indicate that PTEN-loss in MCF10A
cells increased sensitivity to the Akt inhibitor GDC-0068,
whereas decreased sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors. This is
consistent with the hypothesis that Akt activation becomes
less dependent on PI3K activity upon PTEN-loss, and that
activated Akt is preferentially targeted by ATP-competitive
inhibitors such as GDC-0068 (29).

GDC-0068 is efﬁcacious in a broad spectrum of human
cancer xenograft models

The in vitro sensitivity proﬁle of GDC-0068 was recapit-
ulated in vivo in xenograft models representing a spectrum
of cancer types including prostate, breast, ovarian, colorec-
tal, non–small cell lung, glioblastoma, and melanoma
(Fig. 4A and B). GDC-0068 was typically efﬁcacious in
xenograft models in which Akt was activated because of
genetic alterations including PTEN loss, PIK3CA mutations/
ampliﬁcations, or HER2 overexpression. In these models,
tumor growth delay, stasis, or regression was achieved at or
below 100 mg/kg daily oral dose, which was the maximum
dose tested in immunocompromised mice that was well
tolerated. In contrast, cancer cell lines and xenograft models
that harbor mutations in KRAS or BRAF, such as the
KRASG12C mutant NCI-H2122 non–small cell lung carci-
noma (NSCLC) or the KRASG12D and PIK3CAH1047R mutant
HCT-116 colorectal cancer (CRC) model, were less sensitive
to GDC-0068 both in vitro and in vivo, even in models with a
coexisting PIK3CA mutation (Figs. 3A, 4A and B). Interest-
ingly, an ovarian cancer cell line that contains both PTEN
loss and the PIK3CAH1047R hot-spot mutation, TOV-21G
and its in vivo selected subline TOV-21G.x1, remained
exquisitely sensitive to GDC-0068 both in vitro and in vivo
despite the presence of the KRASG13C mutation (Figs. 3A, 4A
and B and Supplementary Table S2), suggesting that Akt
activity is indispensible for cell viability in this line. Single
agent treatment of GDC-0068 was well tolerated with
less than 10% body weight loss observed compared with
vehicle controls in all models tested in vivo (Supplementary
Table S3).

pharmacodynamics (PD) of GDC-0068 was investigated

of GDC-0068 in these 3 cell lines is 2.56, 0.44, and 0.11
mmol/L, respectively. The phosphorylation levels of Akt,
PRAS40, and S6 in MCF7-neo/HER2 tumors, as well as
plasma and tumor concentrations of GDC-0068, were
evaluated over 24 hours following a single dose of GDC-
0068 at 0, 12.5, 50, or 100 mg/kg (Fig. 5A). Within 0.5 hour,
a dose-dependent increase in Akt phosphorylation at both
T308 and S473 sites was observed, reaching maximal levels
between 4 and 8 hours. The kinetics of pAkt levels correlated
better with GDC-0068 drug kinetics in tumors than in

of S6 at Ser235 and/or Ser236 was also inhibited in a dose-
and time-dependent manner, albeit with delayed kinetics
consistent with the distal nature of this biomarker down-
stream of Akt. The tumor pharmacodynamics effect of
GDC-0068 was also analyzed in the TOV-21G.x1 ovarian
cancer xenograft model. Similar to observations in the

x1 tumors with 50% or more reduction sustained between 3
to 8 hours when animals were dosed with 25 and 50 mg/kg
GDC-0068 (Fig. 5B).

GDC-0068 elicited tumor stasis at 25 mg/kg in the TOV-
21G.x1 model, with partial regressions observed at 50 mg/
kg or higher, suggesting a strong dependence on Akt sig-
naling in this model (Fig. 4A). To further investigate the
mechanism of GDC-0068–mediated TGI, the level of CC3
was determined by IHC in the TOV-21G.x1 tumors treated
with GDC-0068. A signiﬁcant increase in nuclear CC3 was
observed within 1 hour, with maximum levels observed at 3
hour in the 50 mg/kg group (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig.
S4). Substantial tumor regression was also observed in the
PTEN-null prostate cancer model LNCaP with 50 mg/kg or
higher doses of GDC-0068 (Fig. 4A). Induction of apoptosis
was also evidenced by a dose-dependent increase in the
cleavage of PARP within 4 hours postdose, correlating
with inhibition of pPRAS40T246 and pS6S240/244 in this
model (Fig. 5D and E). Thus, efﬁcacy of GDC-0068 in
xenograft models is associated with efﬁcient inhibition of
Akt signaling nodes and induction of cell death in the
sensitive models.

GDC-0068 enhanced the antitumor activity of
chemotherapeutic agents

Akt activation has been associated with resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents (15). We hypothesized that inhi-
biting Akt activity with GDC-0068 would overcome resis-
tance or enhance the antitumor activity of standard of care
chemotherapeutic drugs. Indeed, combination of multiple
chemotherapeutic agents with GDC-0068 resulted in com-
bination index (CI) values below 0.8 in the majority of
cancer cell lines tested (as determined by the Chou and
Talalay method; ref. 34), suggesting synergism for most of
the combinations (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Interestingly,
MCF10A cells with isogenic knockin of the activating
PIK3CA mutation H1047R exhibited decreased sensitivity
to docetaxel compared with the WT parental cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. S5B). Combination with GDC-0068 resulted
in signiﬁcantly increased inhibition of cell viability in both
PIK3CA WT and H1047R mutants compared with each
single agent alone, suggesting Akt activation contributes to
the resistance to docetaxel (Supplementary Fig. S5C).

When tested in vivo, daily dosing of GDC-0068 in
combination with docetaxel induced tumor regression
and stasis in the PC-3 and MCF7-neo/HER2 xenograft
models, at doses where each single agent was ineffective
or only caused modest tumor growth delay (Fig. 6A and
B). Similarly, increased TGI was observed in the OVCAR3
ovarian cancer xenograft model when GDC-0068 was

GDC-0068, a Novel Selective ATP-Competitive Akt Inhibitor

combined with carboplatin (Fig. 6C). The combination
of GDC-0068 with docetaxel or carboplatin was tolerated
with less than 5% body weight loss when compared
with treatment with each chemotherapeutic agent alone
(Supplementary Table S3).

Discussion

Identiﬁed 2 decades ago, the serine/threonine kinase Akt
has emerged as a promising target for drug development.
Akt is critically involved in multiple signaling cascades,
controlling cell growth and proliferation, and its activation
is a prominent feature of many human cancers. On the basis
of the strong rationale for targeting Akt for cancer therapy,
multiple attempts to identify Akt inhibitors with acceptable
pharmaceutical properties have been pursued (17). How-
ever, despite the signiﬁcant progress in identifying Akt
small-molecule inhibitors, selectivity has been a key issue
for many previously reported ATP-competitive Akt inhibi-
tors (relative to the kinome, especially within the AGC
kinase family), raising concerns on safety and unclear
mechanisms of action of these drugs. Even allosteric inhi-
bitors, which held the promise of greater selectivity against
the kinome, have been reported to exhibit unexpected
nonkinase off-target effects (35).

GDC-0068 is a highly selective, orally available pan-Akt
inhibitor discovered through a structure-based drug discov-
ery approach guided by cocrystal structures of ATP-com-
petitive inhibitors in complex with Akt1 and the closely
related PKA (26). It exhibited unprecedented selectivity
against the kinome, including AGC family members previ-
ously shown to be signiﬁcantly inhibited by other ATP-
competitive inhibitors (20, 21). Our preclinical work pre-
sented in this report shows that GDC-0068 effectively
inhibited Akt signaling to downstream biomarkers and
dose-dependently decreased tumor cell viability in a broad
spectrum of tumor models in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we
observed a strong association between cellular sensitivity to
GDC-0068 and baseline levels of Akt activation. Genetic
alterations that lead to Akt activation, most notably PTEN
loss and PIK3CA kinase domain mutations, also showed
positive correlation with sensitivity to GDC-0068, whereas
mutations in KRAS or BRAF were negative predictors of
GDC-0068 sensitivity.
Interestingly, while PTEN-loss
decreased sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors GDC-0941 and
GDC-0980 in PTEN knockout MCF10A cells compared with
the isogenic parental cells, it increased the sensitivity of
these cells to GDC-0068, which is consistent with the
notion that PTEN-loss reduces the dependence of Akt acti-
vation on PI3K activity and promotes cell proliferation in an
Akt-dependent manner. Lessons learned from clinical
experiments have indicated that broad and potent preclin-
ical activity does not necessarily translate into clinical
success without acceptable therapeutic index. As an ATP-
competitive inhibitor, selective targeting of activated Akt is
expected to further increase GDC-0068
s effectiveness in
cells with high pAkt levels (29), such as tumor cells
with PTEN-loss (31), whereas decrease its potency in cells
thereby
with low Akt activity, such as normal cells,

potentially widen its therapeutic index. Interestingly, dif-
ferent safety proﬁles have been observed between allosteric
and ATP-competitive inhibitors in the clinic, for example,
rash is reported as a dose-limiting toxicity for the allosteric
inhibitor MK2206 but not several ATP-competitive Akt
inhibitors including GDC-0068 (36–38), raising the pos-
sibility that differences in on-target effects on normal cells
could exist between the 2 classes of inhibitors due to their
different mechanisms of action.

In xenograft models, GDC-0068 was efﬁcacious as a
single agent when administered orally in models with
genetic alterations that are predicted to cause activation of
Akt, consistent with our in vitro results. The maximum
antitumor effect of GDC-0068 achieved in the PC-3 xeno-
graft model was comparable with the TGI generated by
inducible shRNA knockdown of all 3 Akt isoforms in this
model (18), consistent with an on-target drug effect. We
also conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of GDC-0068 in more clinically
relevant disease models such as the patient-derived andro-
gen-independent prostate cancer primary xenograft model
LuCaP35V, which expresses reduced levels of the PTEN
protein. Collectively, GDC-0068 shows single agent and
on-target activity in tumor models in which the Akt pathway
is activated.

Analysis of GDC-0068 pharmacokinetics

revealed
dose-dependent plasma and tumor exposure. GDC-
0068 caused an increase in pAkt levels even at subefﬁca-
cious doses and the kinetics of pAkt increase correlated
with tumor drug levels. This is consistent with our ﬁnding
that ATP-competitive inhibitors lock Akt in a hyperpho-
sphorylated yet nonfunctional state by preventing the
accessibility of phosphatases (29), and as such, pAkt
increase is a direct indicator of GDC-0068 binding to
Akt. At efﬁcacious doses a 50% to 75% suppression of the
Akt substrate pPRAS40 and the downstream target pS6
was observed, showing inhibition of Akt signaling is
necessary for robust antitumor responses in vivo. How-
ever, the degree of TGI varies between different models,
with responses ranging from tumor growth delay to
tumor regression even in the presence of comparable
pPRAS40 suppression. The latter suggests that genetic
background of each tumor model determines the depen-
dence of tumor growth on Akt signaling.

Akt is known to be critically involved in glucose metab-
olism (15), and indeed we observed a transient, completely
reversible increase in glucose and insulin levels in preclin-
ical models after GDC-0068 treatment (data not shown),
consistent with an on-target effect on Akt. Details of these
data will be discussed elsewhere.

In summary, GDC-0068 is a novel, highly selective ATP-
competitive Akt inhibitor with compelling selectivity, efﬁ-
cacy, and oral pharmacokinetics that support its clinical
development as an anticancer agent either singly or in
combination with chemotherapeutic agents. The selective
activity of GDC-0068 in cancer cells with activated Akt
signaling allows for a rational strategy to identify patients
who will potentially beneﬁt in clinical trials, which are
currently underway.
