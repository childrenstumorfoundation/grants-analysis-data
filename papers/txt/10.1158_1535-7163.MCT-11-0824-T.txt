Abstract

AKT is a key node in the most frequently deregulated signaling network in human cancer. AZD5363, a novel
pyrrolopyrimidine-derived compound, inhibited all AKT isoforms with a potency of 10 nmol/L or less and
inhibited phosphorylation of AKT substrates in cells with a potency of approximately 0.3 to 0.8 mmol/L.
AZD5363 monotherapy inhibited the proliferation of 41 of 182 solid and hematologic tumor cell lines with a
potency of 3 mmol/L or less. Cell lines derived from breast cancers showed the highest frequency of sensitivity.
There was a signiﬁcant relationship between the presence of PIK3CA and/or PTEN mutations and sensitivity
to AZD5363 and between RAS mutations and resistance. Oral dosing of AZD5363 to nude mice caused dose-
and time-dependent reduction of PRAS40, GSK3b, and S6 phosphorylation in BT474c xenografts (PRAS40
 0.1 mmol/L total plasma exposure), reversible increases in blood glucose concentra-
phosphorylation EC50
tions, and dose-dependent decreases in 2[18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) uptake in U87-MG xeno-
grafts. Chronic oral dosing of AZD5363 caused dose-dependent growth inhibition of xenografts derived from
various tumor types, including HER2
breast cancer models that are resistant to trastuzumab. AZD5363 also
signiﬁcantly enhanced the antitumor activity of docetaxel, lapatinib, and trastuzumab in breast cancer
xenografts. It is concluded that AZD5363 is a potent inhibitor of AKT with pharmacodynamic activity in
vivo, has potential to treat a range of solid and hematologic tumors as monotherapy or a combinatorial agent,
and has potential for personalized medicine based on the genetic status of PIK3CA, PTEN, and RAS. AZD5363
is currently in phase I clinical trials. Mol Cancer Ther; 11(4); 873–87. Ó2012 AACR.

Introduction

The signaling network involving phosphoinositide 3-
kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB, also known as AKT),
and mTOR is the most frequently deregulated in human
cancer and an important axis for the development of new
therapies (1, 2). The network is mutationally activated in
distinct ways in different tumor types. For example, in
estrogen receptor (ER)
breast cancers, activating muta-
tions in the catalytic subunit of PI3Ka are common,
whereas mutations in AKT1 and PTEN occur at lower

frequency (3). In prostate cancer, loss of phosphatases
including PTEN and INPP4B are common (4–6). In con-
trast to the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, signaling through
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling network is noncanoni-
cal; the presence of mutations in multiple signaling com-
ponents in tumor types such as endometrial (7) and
bladder (8) supports this concept. PI3K/AKT integrates
signaling inputs from many sources including receptor
tyrosine kinases and small GTPases, many of which are
also commonly ampliﬁed or mutated in human cancer,
including HER2 and RAS, respectively (9). AKT is a key
node in the signaling network, with multiple substrates
that mediate processes as diverse as cell proliferation,
resistance to apoptosis, and glucose and fatty acid metab-
olism, which are activated in a wide range of solid and
hematologic malignancies (10, 11). AKT activation, either
directly or indirectly by loss of PTEN and other means, has
been shown to mediate resistance to inhibitors of receptor
tyrosine kinases such as HER2 (12, 13), antihormonal
agents in breast (14–16) and prostate (17–19) cancers, and
chemotherapy (20–22). Therefore, it is one of the most
promising targets for cancer therapy, with a considerable
platform of preclinical validation.

Davies et al.

There are a number of ways to inhibit the activity of
AKT; 2 distinct types of relatively selective AKT inhibitor
are being tested in the clinic. The most advanced agent is
MK-2206, an allosteric inhibitor, which binds to the region
that interacts with both the pleckstrin homology and
kinase domains, and prevents translocation of AKT to
the membrane and activation. This compound has been
shown to enhance antitumor efﬁcacy by chemotherapeu-
tic agents and molecularly targeted therapies in preclin-
ical models (23) and is currently in phase II clinical trials.
The dose-limiting toxicity in the clinic is rash, and modest
monotherapy clinical activity has been reported. Classical
ATP competitive kinase domain inhibitors, which prevent
substrate phosphorylation by AKT, have also been devel-
oped. The ﬁrst of these to be described in detail in the
literature was GSK690693 (24). This compound was
potent and speciﬁc, but lacked oral bioavailability and
was withdrawn from development in phase I trials. More
recently, compounds with oral bioavailability have been
disclosed, from a number of companies including Gen-
entech (GDC-0068), Lilly, and GSK, several of which are in
phase I clinical testing. For the development of AZD5363,
we were provided with a number of potential starting
points arising from our earlier collaboration with Astex
Therapeutics and their collaboration with the Institute of
Cancer Research, United Kingdom, including the pro-
mising chemical series exempliﬁed by the orally active

compound CCT129254 (25). Our internal development
ultimately led to the identiﬁcation of the clinical devel-
opment candidate AZD5363. We now describe the pri-
mary pharmacology of AZD5363, a potent pan-AKT
kinase inhibitor, with pharmacodynamic properties con-
sistent with the mechanism of action of an AKT inhib-
itor in vivo. AZD5363 inhibits the growth of a range of
human tumor xenografts, as monotherapy or in combi-
nation with HER2 inhibitors in breast cancer models.
AZD5363 also produces very signiﬁcant tumor regres-
sions in combination with docetaxel in breast cancer
xenografts. On the basis of these data, AZD5363 is cur-
rently being investigated in phase I clinical trials.

Enzyme assays

The ability of AZD5363 to inhibit the activity of AKT1,
AKT2, and AKT3 was evaluated by the Caliper Off-Chip
Incubation Mobility Shift assay. Active recombinant
AKT1 (Upstate), AKT2, or AKT3 (both obtained from
Invitrogen) were incubated with a 5-FAM–labeled cus-
tom-synthesized peptide substrate (Cambridge Research
Biochemicals) together with increasing concentrations of
inhibitor. Final reactions contained 1 to 3 nmol/L AKT1,
AKT2, or AKT3 enzymes; 1.5 mmol/L peptide substrate;
ATP at K
m for each AKT isoform; 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
4 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 mmol/L HEPES, and
0.015% Brij-35. The reactions were incubated at room
temperature for 1 hour and stopped by the addition of
buffer containing 100 mmol/L HEPES, 0.015% Brij-35
solution, 0.1% coating reagent (Caliper), 40 mmol/L
EDTA, and 5% DMSO. Plates were then analyzed using
a Caliper LC3000, allowing for separation of peptide
substrate and phosphorylated product by electrophoresis
with subsequent detection and quantiﬁcation of laser-
induced ﬂuorescence. To determine the kinase selectivity
proﬁle, AZD5363 was also tested against PKA, ROCK1,
ROCK2, and P70S6K. PKA, ROCK1, and ROCK2 activity
were determined by Caliper Off-Chip Incubation Mobility
Shift Assay, as described earlier. Final reaction condi-
tions for measuring ROCKI activity were 5 nmol/L active
recombinant ROCK1 (Invitrogen), 1.5 mmol/L ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled custom peptide sub-
strate, 7 mmol/L ATP, 1 mmol/L DTT, 5 mmol/L MgCl2,
100 mmol/L HEPES, 0.015% Brij-35, and 5 mmol/L
b-glycerophosphate; ﬁnal reaction for measuring ROCK2
activity contained 7.5 nmol/L active recombinant ROCK2
(Upstate), 1.5 mmol/L FAM-labeled custom peptide
substrate, 7.5 mmol/L ATP, 1 mmol/L DTT, 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, 100 mmol/L HEPES, 0.015% Brij-35, and
5 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate; and protein kinase A
(PKA) activity was measured in a ﬁnal reaction con-
taining 0.0625 nmol/L PKA (Upstate), 3 mmol/L FITC-
labeled custom peptide substrate, 4.6 mmol/L ATP, 1
mmol/L DTT, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 110 mmol/L HEPES,
and 0.015% Brij-35. P70S6K activity was measured by a
radioactive (33P-ATP) ﬁlter-binding assay. Recombinant
S6K1 (T412E) was assayed against a substrate peptide
(KKRNRTLTV) in a ﬁnal volume of 25.5 mL containing
8 mmol/L MOPS, 200 mmol/L EDTA, 100 mmol/L
substrate peptide, 10 mmol/L magnesium acetate,
20 mmol/L g-33P-ATP (50–1,000 cpm/pmol), and in-
creasing concentrations of AZD5363. The reactions were
incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and
terminated by the addition of 0.5 mol (3%) orthopho-
sphoric acid. Reactions were then harvested onto a P81
UniFilter and product formation quantiﬁed. IC50 values
for all enzyme assays were obtained by ﬁtting data in
Origin 7.0. To evaluate a broader selectivity proﬁle,
AZD5363 was also tested across the Dundee Kinase Panel

Cellular inhibition of AKT

A high-throughput screening cell-based assay was
developed to measure cellular AKT activity using the
MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line. Cells were exposed
to AZD5363 at concentrations ranging from 3 to 0.003
mmol/L. After a 2-hour treatment, cells were ﬁxed with
formaldehyde, washed, permeabilized with 0.5% poly-
sorbate 20 and then probed with a phospho-speciﬁc anti-
body against GSK3bser9. Levels of phosphorylated
GSK3bser9 were measured with an Acumen Explorer laser
scanning cytometer (TTP LabTech) and IC50 values esti-
mates by ﬁtting data in Origin 7.0.

Western blot analysis

LNCaP prostate cancer cells and BT474c breast adeno-
carcinoma cells were exposed to AZD5363 at concentra-
tions ranging from 10 to 0.03 mmol/L for 2 or 24 hours.
Cells were then lysed on ice with a buffer containing
25 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 3 mmol/L EDTA, 3 mmol/L EGTA,
50 mmol/L NaF, 2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
0.27 mol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate,
5 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.5% Triton X-
100 and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates
were then diluted with sample loading buffer (Invitro-
gen), separated on 4% to 12% Bis-Tris Novex gels, trans-
ferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with
antibodies for phospho-PRAS40, phospho-GSK3b, phos-
pho-S6, phospho-AKT, phospho-4E-BP1, total 4E-BP1,
PARP, and caspase-3. After an overnight incubation with
the primary antibody, membranes were washed and
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary
antibodies, followed by visualization of the immuno-
blotted proteins on a Syngene ChemiGenius with Super-
Signal West Dura Chemiluminescence Substrate. Quan-
tiﬁcation was carried out using Syngene GeneTools, and
IC50 values were estimated.

FOXO3a translocation assay

BT474c cells were seeded into a clear bottom, black wall

C, 5% CO2
96-well plate, and incubated overnight at 37
before being exposed to AZD5363 at concentrations rang-
ing from 3 to 0.003 mmol/L. After 2 hours of treatment,
cells were ﬁxed with formaldehyde, permeabilized with
0.5% polysorbate 20, and then probed with a primary
antibody against FOXO3a overnight at 4
C. Following a
wash step, cells were incubated with a secondary anti-
body conjugated to an Alexa Fluor 488 dye and imaged
using a Cellomics ArrayScan. An algorithm measuring the
ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic ﬂuorescence intensity was
developed, and IC50 values were estimated.

CO2. Cells were then exposed to concentrations of
AZD5363 ranging from 30 to 0.003 mmol/L for 72 hours.
For the MTS endpoint, cell proliferation was measured by
the CellTiter AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation
Assay (Promega) reagent in accordance with the manu-
facturer’s protocol. Absorbance was measured with a
Tecan Ultra instrument. For the Sytox Green endpoint,
Sytox Green nucleic acid dye (Invitrogen) diluted in TBS-
EDTA buffer was added to cells (ﬁnal concentration of
0.13 mmol/L) and the number of dead cells detected using
an Acumen Explorer. Cells were then permeabilized by
the addition of saponin (0.03% ﬁnal concentration, diluted
in TBS-EDTA buffer), incubated overnight and a total cell
count measured. Predose measurements were made for
both MTS and Sytox Green endpoints, and concentration
needed to reduce the growth of treated cells to half that of
untreated cells (GI50) values were determined using
absorbance readings (MTS) or live cell counts (Sytox
Green).

Animals




C–23

Speciﬁc, pathogen-free,

female nude mice (nu/nu:
Alpk) and male SCID mice (SCID/CB17; 786-0 xenograft
studies) were bred at AstraZeneca (Alderley Park) and
housed in pathogen-free conditions. Animals were main-
tained in rooms under controlled conditions of tempera-
C), humidity (55%  10%), photoperiod (12
ture (19
hours light/12 hours dark), and air exchange. Animals
were housed in standard cages within a ﬂexible ﬁlm
isolator, with food and water provided ad libitum. The
facilities have been approved by the Home Ofﬁce License
and meet all current regulations and standards of the
United Kingdom. The mice were used between the ages
of 8 and 12 weeks in accordance with institutional
guidelines.

Implantation of cells into mice

For in vivo implants, cells were harvested from T225 tissue
culture ﬂasks by a 2- to 5-minute treatment with 0.05%
trypsin (Invitrogen) in EDTA solution followed by suspen-
sion in basic medium and 3 washes in PBS (Invitrogen).
Only single-cell suspensions of greater than 90% viability, as
determined by trypan blue exclusion, were used for injec-
tion. Tumor cells were injected subcutaneously in the left
ﬂank of the animal in a volume of 0.1 mL. For BT474c studies
the animals were supplemented with 0.36 mg/60-d 17b
estradiol pellets (Innovative Research of America) 1 day
before cell implantation. For KPL-4 and HGC-27 antitumor
studies, tumors were passaged as approximately 10 mm3
fragments into the ﬂank before carrying out efﬁcacy studies,
to achieve more consistent take rates.

Efﬁcacy studies

DMSO 25% w/v Kleptose HPB (Roquette) buffer by oral
gavage, docetaxel (Sanoﬁ-Aventis) solubilized in 2.6%
ethanol in injectable water by intravenous injection once
on day 1 at 15 or 5 mg/kg once weekly. When admin-
istered in combination, docetaxel was administered
1 hour before the oral dose of AZD5363. The control
group received the DMSO/Kleptose buffer alone, twice
daily by oral gavage. Tumor volumes (measured by
caliper), animal body weight, and tumor condition were
recorded twice weekly for the duration of the study.
Mice were sacriﬁced by CO2 euthanasia. The tumor
volume was calculated (taking length to be the longest
diameter across the tumor and width to be the corre-
sponding perpendicular diameter) using the formula:
(length  width)  H(length  width)  (p/6). Growth
inhibition from the start of treatment was assessed by
comparison of the differences in tumor volume between
control and treated groups. Because the variance in
mean tumor volume data increases proportionally with
volume (and is therefore disproportionate between
groups), data were log transformed to remove any size
dependency before statistical evaluation. Statistical sig-
niﬁcance was evaluated using a one-tailed, 2-sample t
test.

Pharmacodynamic studies
When mean tumor size reached 0.5 cm3, the mice were
randomized into control (n ¼ 8 animals) and treatment
groups (n ¼ 5 animals per group). The treatment groups
received 300 or 100 mg/kg acute dose of AZD5363 solu-
bilized in a DMSO/Kleptose buffer, by oral gavage. The
control group received the DMSO/Kleptose buffer
alone, once by oral gavage. At 2, 4, 8, 16, or 24 hours after
dosing, the animals were humanely killed and the tumor
was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80

C.
Total blood was collected by intracardiac puncture and
plasma prepared and immediately frozen at  20

C for
pharmacokinetic analysis. Frozen tumors were homoge-
nized using Fastprep methodology lysis matrix A (MP
Biomedicals) and lysates generated using adjusted lysis
buffer (1% Triton X-100). Equivalent amounts of protein
(12 mg per lane) were resolved by 4% to 15% gradient SDS-
PAGE premade gels (#345-0035 Bio-Rad) and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then incu-
bated with primary antibodies tGSK3b (BD Transduction
Laboratories #610202), pGSK3b (CST #9336), tS6 (CST
#2217), pS6 (CST #2211), and subsequently with HP-con-
jugated antimouse IgG (CST #7076) or antirabbit IgG
(#7074) diluted in 5% marvel in PBS. Immunoreactive
proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
(Pierce; #34080) and bands quantiﬁed with a ChemiGenius
(Syngene). Phosphorylated PRAS40 (T246) was measured
by solid phase sandwich ELISA (Biosource #KHO0421)

When mean tumor sizes reached approximately
0.2 cm3, the mice were randomized into control and
treatment groups. The treatment groups received vary-
ing dose schedules of AZD5363 solubilized in a 10%

(determined by thin-layer chromatography) was greater
than 95%. Imaging was carried out using the Inveon
positron emission tomography (PET) and computed
tomography-docked system from Siemens Medical Solu-
tions. Data were acquired with IAW software (Siemens)
Version 1.4.3 and analyzed with IRW software (Siemens)
version 3.0. The performance of the scanner has been
documented previously (27).

Images were reconstructed using the MAP/3D algo-
rithm (quality control measurement was carried out for
the PET scanner before commencement of imaging). Fol-
lowing imaging, tumors were snap frozen in liquid nitro-
gen and stored at  80
C. Mice received on average 7.96
MBq of radioactivity as a bolus intravenous injection via
the tail vein under isoﬂurane anesthesia. Food was with-
drawn on the day of imaging in half-hour intervals so each
mouse was fasted for 4 hours before injection of 18F-FDG.
Mice were dosed with either vehicle or AZD5363 (130, 200,
or 300 mg/kg) and were imaged 4 hours after drug
dosing. Mice were anesthetized in preparation for 18F-
FDG injection 3 hours and 15 minutes after dosing, and
anesthesia was then maintained for a 45-minute uptake
period followed by a 20-minute PET scan under isoﬂurane
anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced using isoﬂurane
delivered in 100% oxygen (1.5% isoﬂurane, 3 L oxygen).
Respiration and temperature were monitored through-

Images were reconstructed using the MAP/3D algo-

the whole tumor. Data were expressed as the maximum
standardized uptake value (SUV). Max SUV was calcu-
lated using the following formula described by Gambhir,

Blood glucose concentration was measured before

Blood glucose concentrations were measured with an
Accu Chek meter (AVIVA, Roche). Data are reported
as mean  SEM unless otherwise stated. Statistical ana-
lyses were conducted using GraphPad prism (v. 4.02).
An ANOVA allowing for treatment group was carried
out as well as group means, which were compared
using a 2-sided t test.

Plasma pharmacokinetic analyses

Plasma samples were extracted by protein precipitation
in methanol. Following centrifugation, the supernatants

AZD5363, an Oral Inhibitor of AKT

were mixed with water in a ratio of 1 in 10 (v/v). Extracts
were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromato-
graphy/mass spectrometry using a reversed phase Gem-
ini column (Phenomenex) and a gradient mobile phase
containing water/methanol/formic acid. Peaks were de-
tected using a Micromass/Waters MS technology Ultima
mass spectrometer.

Results
AZD5363 is a potent inhibitor of AKT in vitro

In isolated enzyme assays, AZD5363 inhibited all 3
isoforms of AKT, with an IC50 < 10 nmol/L. P70S6K and
PKA were inhibited with similar potency to the AKT
isoforms, but a lower potency was shown against the Rho
kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 (Table 1). Further insight into
selectivity was obtained by screening the compound at a
concentration of 1 mmol/L in a panel of 75 kinases, which
included 35 members of the AGC kinase family. AZD5363
had signiﬁcant activity (>75% inhibition at 1 mmol/L)
against 15 kinases, 14 of which were members of the AGC
family. These enzymes were AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, P70S6K,
PKA, ROCK2, MKK1, MSK1, MSK2, PKCg, PKGa, PKGb,
PRKX, RSK2, and RSK3 (data not shown).

The activity of AZD5363 in cells was determined by its
ability to inhibit phosphorylation of its substrates PRAS40
and GSK3b in BT474c (Her2
PIK3CA mutant breast) and
LNCaP (PTEN-null prostate) cancer cells using Western
blotting, and in MDA-MB-468 (PTEN-null breast) cancer
cells, by an immunoﬂuorescence-based (Acumen) assay.
AZD5363 inhibited phosphorylation of these substrates

with an IC50 value of 0.06 to 0.76 mmol/L in the 3 cell lines
(Table 1). The phosphorylation status of AKT, and several
proteins downstream of AKT in the signaling network,
were also monitored by Western blotting in BT474c and
LNCaP cells. AZD5363 effectively inhibited phosphory-
lation of S6 and 4E-BP1 in these cell lines, whereas it
increased phosphorylation of AKT at both ser473 and
thr308 (Fig. 2B). The activity of AZD5363 was also mea-
sured by its ability to induce nuclear translocation of

FOXO3a in BT474c cells. Inhibition of AKT prevents
phosphorylation of FOXO3a; this results in translocation
of FOXO3a to the nucleus, where it is able to switch on the
expression of genes such as p27, FasL, and BIM, which
collectively induce cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. In
BT474c cells, AZD5363 induced FOXO3a nuclear translo-
cation with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50)
value of 0.69 mmol/L; a concentration of 3 mmol/L was
sufﬁcient to almost completely localize FOXO3a to the
nucleus (Fig. 2C). To show P70S6K pharmacology of
AZD5363 in cells, we used the RT4 bladder cancer cell
line. These cells have a homozygous deletion in TSC1 and
very low TSC2 expression; hence, AKT is largely
uncoupled from P70S6K in these cells. In this cell line,
AZD5363 inhibited S6 phosphorylation with an IC50 value
of approximately 4.8 mmol/L, whereas the allosteric inhib-
itor MK-2206 was much less active (IC50 > 30 mmol/L;
Supplementary Fig. S1).

AZD5363 inhibits in vitro growth of a subset of tumor
cell lines

þ

and ER

The activity of monotherapy AZD5363 was measured
by its ability to inhibit growth of a panel of 182 cell lines
derived from solid and hematologic tumors, by a standard
proliferation assay. Tumor cell lines that were inhibited
with a GI50 < 3 mmol/L were classiﬁed as sensitive where-
as those with a GI50 > 3 mmol/L were classiﬁed as resistant.
Forty-one cell lines (23%) were classiﬁed as sensitive; 25
of these lines (14%) were inhibited with a GI50 < 1 mmol/L
and were classiﬁed as highly sensitive. The highest fre-
quency of sensitivity was seen in cell lines derived from
breast cancers (14 of 22; 64%); HER2
breast
cancer cell lines were consistently sensitive (Fig. 3A). Cell
lines derived from endometrial, gastric, hematologic, and
prostate cancers all showed a frequency of response of
24% to 33%, although only 6 unique prostate cancer cell
lines were screened. Cell lines derived from lung and
colorectal tumors showed a lower frequency of response
at 12% and 7% respectively, whereas all the cell lines
derived from bladder cancers were classiﬁed as resistant.
There appeared to be a correlation between sensitivity to
AZD5363 and either the presence of activating PIK3CA
mutations, PTEN loss or inactivating mutation, or HER2
ampliﬁcation. Nineteen of 25 (76%) cell lines classiﬁed as
highly sensitive and 30 of 41 (73%) the cell lines classiﬁed
as sensitive carried at least one of these genetic defects
(Fig. 3B). When data from the whole-cell panel were
analyzed, regardless of other mutations, a signiﬁcant
relationship was found between the presence of PIK3CA
mutations and sensitivity to AZD5363 (P ¼ 0.0059; t test).
When mutations in the helical and catalytic domains of
PIK3CA were analyzed separately, a signiﬁcant correla-
tion was found between both types of mutation and
sensitivity to AZD5363 (P ¼ 0.024 and 0.0047 for helical
and kinase domain mutations, respectively). A signiﬁcant
correlation was also found between PTEN mutation (loss
or gene sequence mutation) and sensitivity to AZD5363
(P ¼ 0.0099; t test; Supplementary Fig. S2). A signiﬁcant

correlation between the presence of a RAS mutation
(collectively analyzing K-, N-, or H-RAS mutations) and
resistance to AZD5363 was also found (P ¼ 0.038; t test).
When cell lines with coincident RAS mutations were

AZD5363 inhibits the growth of human tumor
xenografts in vivo

The effect of monotherapy AZD5363 on growth of
xenografts was determined by continuous oral dosing to
nude mice. Dose-dependent inhibition was observed in all
models tested. In HER2
ampliﬁed, PIK3CA mutant
BT474c xenografts, oral administration at 100 mg/kg
twice daily resulted in 80% inhibition (P < 0.0001); this
schedule was more effective than 200 mg/kg every day
(39% inhibition; P ¼ 0.02) but less effective than the

þ

maximum well-tolerated dose of 200 mg/kg twice daily
þ
(104% inhibition; P < 0.0001; Fig. 4A). In the HER2
ampliﬁed, PIK3CA mutant HCC-1954 breast cancer xeno-
graft, AZD5363 at 150 mg/kg twice daily caused pro-
nounced tumor regression (129% inhibition; P < 0.0001)
whereas 75 mg/kg twice daily resulted in 111% inhibition
(P < 0.001; Fig. 4B).
In contrast, 30 mg/kg twice
weekly trastuzumab was inactive in this HER2
model.
In 786-0 PTEN-null renal cancer xenografts, AZD5363 at
150 mg/kg twice daily resulted in partial regression (125%
inhibition; P < 0.0001) whereas 75 mg/kg twice daily
caused partial growth inhibition (56%; P ¼ 0.001;
Fig. 4C). AZD5363 also inhibited growth of PIK3CA
mutant/PTEN-null HGC-27 gastric cancer xenografts at
doses more than 50 mg/kg twice daily; in this model slight
tumor regressions were observed at doses more than 100
mg/kg twice daily, and a dose-dependent time to pro-
gression was observed after cessation of dosing (108%,
106%, and 72% inhibition of growth; P < 0.0001, 0.001 and

AZD5363 has pharmacodynamic activity in vivo

The pharmacodynamic activity of AZD5363 was deter-
mined in BT474c xenografts in nude mice, following acute
doses of 300 and 100 mg/kg and related to plasma phar-
macokinetics (Fig. 5A). Following a 300 mg/kg dose of
AZD5363, phosphorylation of PRAS40, GSK3b, and S6
was signiﬁcantly inhibited for at least 24 hours. pPRAS40
was most strongly inhibited, with approximately 90%
inhibition at 1 and 2 hours, and this recovered to approx-
imately 70% inhibition at 24 hours. Inhibition of GSK3b
and S6 phosphorylation varied from approximately 80%
at 1 hour to approximately 50% at 8 hours and approx-
imately 40% at 24 hours. Total plasma exposure of
AZD5363 (not corrected for protein binding) exceeded
10 mmol/L at 1 hour and remained more than 1 mmol/L for
approximately 8 hours following a 300 mg/kg dose. Phos-
phorylation of all 3 biomarkers was signiﬁcantly inhibited
at for at least 8 hours following a 100 mg/kg dose of
AZD5363, but the magnitude of inhibition was less
than that observed following a 300 mg/kg dose (Fig.
5A). Plasma exposure of AZD5363 was approximately
1 mmol/L for at least 4 hours following a 100 mg/kg dose.
Plotting the pharmacodynamic–pharmacokinetic rela-
tionship between PRAS40 phosphorylation of individual

animals showed that 50% inhibition of pPRAS40 occurred
at a total plasma exposure of approximately 0.1 mmol/L
AZD5363 (Fig. 5B). A dose- and time-dependent relation-
ship between dose of AZD5363 and blood glucose con-
centration was also seen in the nonfasted animals used for
this study; the glucose concentration increased to approx-
imately 20 mmol/L at 2 hours after a 300 mg/kg dose, and
fell back to control levels by 16 hours whereas the glucose
concentration increased by less than 2-fold following a 100
mg/kg dose, and fell to control levels by 8 hours (Fig. 5C).
AKT plays a key role in glucose metabolism; its sub-
strates GSK3b and AS160 can modulate glycogen synthe-
sis and glucose transporter function respectively, and
signaling through the pathway can regulate glycolytic
enzymes including hexokinase and phosphofructokinase.
Indeed, AKT activation may, at least in part, explain the
Warburg effect—the metabolic shift from oxidative phos-
phorylation to elevated glycolysis in tumors (29, 30).
Therefore, 18F-FDG-PET imaging has potential as a bio-
marker of pathway output following AKT inhibition. The
effect of AZD5363 on 18F-FDG uptake was tested in U87-
MG xenografts in fasted nude mice, 4 hours after acute
dosing. Doses of 130, 200, and 300 mg/kg AZD5363 all
caused a signiﬁcant decrease in tumor uptake of 18F-FDG
compared with vehicle controls, but the blood glucose
concentration was only signiﬁcantly elevated at this
time point after 200 and 300 mg/kg doses (Fig. 6A).

Phosphorylation of PRAS40 was also inhibited in the U87-
MG xenografts in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). A
dose-dependent effect on tumor growth was also seen
after chronic dosing, although this only achieved statis-
tical signiﬁcance after 7 days dosing at 300 and 200 mg/kg
every day; doses of 300, 200, and 130 mg/kg every day,
respectively, resulted in 62% (P < 0.0001), 36% (P < 0.001),
and 25% (P ¼ 0.07) inhibition of tumor growth (Fig. 6C).

Mechanism of action of AZD5363

To determine whether AZD5363 has a predominantly
antiproliferative or proapoptotic mechanism of action, a
Sytox Green assay was carried out on a panel of breast and
prostate cancer cell lines, which showed sensitivity to
AZD5363 in the standard proliferation assay. The Sytox
Green assay enables the generation of a dose–response
curve based on cell number and determination of per-
centage of dead cells at a ﬁxed concentration of 1 mmol/L.
The GI50 values in the Sytox Green assay were generally
similar to the proliferation assay values; the values in the 2
assays were all within 5-fold and 8 of 14 (57%) of the cell
lines were within 2-fold. However, more than 10% cell
death was only seen in 3 of 14 cell lines following incu-
bation with 1 mmol/L AZD5363; these cell lines were
BT474c breast and 2 prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP
and PC346C-Flut1; Supplementary Fig. S4A). The induc-
tion of cell death was conﬁrmed in the BT474c cell line by
exposing the cells to increasing concentrations of
AZD5363 and monitoring cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved
PARP. A dose proportional increase in both these apo-
ptotic markers was observed in BT474c cells at 48 hours.
Given that it seems to be possible to induce cell death in

the BT474c cell line in vitro, we compared the effects of a
continuous and intermittent dosing schedule of AZD5363
that delivered similar areas under curve (AUC) but dif-
ferent C
max values on BT474c xenograft growth in vivo.
Continuous dosing of 100 mg/kg twice daily, which
achieved a steady-state exposure of approximately 1
mmol/L AZD5363, resulted in more than 90% inhibition
of tumor growth, as shown previously, but no tumor
regression (Supplementary Fig. S4B). However, a sched-
ule of 300 mg/kg every 4 days on, 3 days off, which
achieves 4-peak concentrations exceeding 10 mmol/L
AZD5363, resulted in waves of tumor regression during
the dosing period, followed by a recovery of tumor
growth in the drug holiday period. When a pharmaco-
dynamic analysis was carried out on these xenografts
after short-term chronic dosing (3 days’ dosing), there
was a signiﬁcant induction of cleaved caspase-3 at
2 hours following a 300 mg/kg dose of AZD5363, which
was not observed after dosing at 100 mg/kg twice daily.
In contrast, Ki-67 staining decreased signiﬁcantly at
8 hours after dosing of both schedules of drug (Supple-
mentary Fig. S4B). These experiments show that a high
dose, intermittent schedule of AZD5363 has the poten-
tial to be more efﬁcacious than a continuous one in
tumors that are susceptible to apoptosis as a conse-
quence of AKT inhibition.

AZD5363 enhances the activity of HER2 inhibitors

tic antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors of HER2
signaling was tested in the HER2

therapy lapatinib at 100 mg/kg every day, trastuzumab
at 15 mg/kg twice weekly, and AZD5363 150 mg/kg
twice daily all inhibited tumor growth (37%, not signif-
icant; 69%, P ¼ 0.002; and 65%, P ¼ 0.004, respectively),
but none achieved stasis. In contrast, combinations of
AZD5363 and trastuzumab or AZD5363 and lapatinib
were well tolerated and, respectively, resulted in tumor
regressions of 107% and 109% (P < 0.0001). Moreover,
the combinations both showed enhanced growth delays
after cessation of dosing compared with the monother-
apy groups (Fig. 7A). The combination of AZD5363 with
docetaxel was tested in 2 different breast cancer xeno-
grafts: BT474c and HCC-1187. In BT474c xenografts, a
single dose of 15 mg/kg docetaxel resulted in slight
tumor regression (129% inhibition; P < 0.0001). When
combined with 150 mg/kg twice daily of AZD5363,
the tumors showed dramatic and greatly enhanced
regressions (159% inhibition; P < 0.0001), with 6 of

9 tumors showing complete regressions where the
tumors were nonmeasurable at the end of the experi-
ment (Fig. 7B). The effect of combining weekly dosing
cycles of 5 mg/kg docetaxel with AZD5363 was
assessed in the HCC-1187 xenograft model. In the ﬁrst
experiment (Fig. 7C), the combination of 150 mg/kg
twice daily of AZD5363 and docetaxel was investigated.
The combination was considerably more efﬁcacious
than either of
the respective monotherapy groups
(100% inhibition; P ¼ 0.0003 for the combination com-
pared with 71% P ¼ 0.002 for monotherapy docetaxel
and 79% P ¼ 0.005 for monotherapy AZD5363) and
showed evidence of increased apoptosis by cleaved
caspase-3 staining (Supplementary Fig. S6). In the sec-
ond experiment (Fig. 7D), the combination of 5 mg/kg
once weekly docetaxel with 2 schedules of AZD5363
that deliver equivalent AUCs was investigated. Both
schedules enhanced the efﬁcacy of docetaxel mono-
therapy, and to a similar extent; at the end of the ﬁrst
dosing period docetaxel monotherapy resulted in 76%

combinations of docetaxel and the continuous and inter-
mittent dosing schedules of AZD5363, respectively,
resulted in 103% and 101% inhibition of tumor growth.
All treatment groups showed regrowth when dosing
was stopped. Following rechallenge with the same
treatments, the docetaxel monotherapy–treated tumors
slowly increased in size, whereas the combination
groups showed progressive regression. The combina-
tion of docetaxel with an intermittent schedule of
300 mg/kg AZD5363 (4 days on, 3 days off) initially
appeared to be slightly superior to the combination
of docetaxel with a continuous dosing schedule of
100 mg/kg twice daily AZD5363, but the group sizes
did not differ signiﬁcantly from one another at the end
of the experiment (Fig. 7D).

Discussion

In our AKT drug discovery program, we ultimately
achieved a combination of favorable characteristics relat-
ing to potency, selectivity proﬁle, and bioavailability in
one small molecule AZD5363. AZD5363 has acceptable
preclinical tolerability, pharmacodynamic characteristics
of an AKT inhibitor, and a distinct proﬁle from the other
AKT inhibitors that have entered clinical development.
It
is challenging to achieve exquisite selectivity for
AGC kinase family members with ATP-competitive AKT
kinase inhibitors; AZD5363 is a potent inhibitor of all 3
AKT isoforms, but also carries equipotent pharmacology,
at least in enzyme assays, against PKA, P70S6K, and some
pharmacologic activity against at least 14 other members
of the AGC kinase family. Despite of this additional
pharmacology, the proﬁle of activity of AZD5363 in our

182 tumor cell line panel is very similar to that of MK-2206
and GSK690693 (data not shown), suggesting that AKT
pharmacology is primarily responsible for its antiproli-
ferative activity. Whereas there is a drop off in potency
against AKT substrates in cellular assays compared with
AKT enzyme assays, AZD5363 can still inhibit the phos-
phorylation of at least 2 AKT substrates and induce
FOXO3A translocation to the nucleus with a potency of
less than 1 mmol/L in sensitive breast and prostate cancer
cell
lines. AZD5363 also reduces phosphorylation of
4EBP-1, a substrate of mTOR, and increases phosphory-
lation of AKT itself; this latter phenomenon has been
reported to occur with several other ATP competitive,
catalytic inhibitors of AKT, and is due to the protein being
held in a hyperphosphorylated but catalytically inactive
form as a consequence of compound binding (31).

Given that total exposures in excess of 10 mmol/L are
achievable at well-tolerated doses in nude mice, it follows
that AZD5363 should achieve excellent pharmacodynam-
ic activity in vivo. This was indeed found to be the case;
AZD5363 inhibited the phosphorylation of PRAS40 and
another AKT substrate, GSKb, and the downstream path-
way protein S6 by approximately 80% to 90%, with sig-
niﬁcant pharmacodynamic activity being maintained for
at least 24 hours, following a 300 mg/kg dose to nude
mice. Pharmacodynamics showed good correlations with
plasma pharmacokinetics; AZD5363 can inhibit the phos-
phorylation of PRAS40 with plasma EC50 value of approx-
imately 0.1 mmol/L in BT474c xenografts growing in nude
mice; this is reasonably consistent with an IC50 value of
approximately 0.3 mmol/L for the same cell line in vitro.
Therefore, the additional pharmacologic properties of
AZD5363 compared with MK-2206 and GSK690693 does
not compromise its tolerability and pharmacodynamic
activity in vivo; in fact the P70S6K pharmacology may be
advantageous, resulting in greater inhibition of S6 phos-
phorylation as a consequence of its direct P70S6K phar-
macology in addition to reduced pathway ﬂux as a con-
sequence of AKT inhibition. However, the presence of
additional P70S6K pharmacology may also have addi-
tional consequences in terms of feedback compared with
other AKT inhibitors; P70S6K is known to result in feed-
back activation of insulin and insulin-like growth factor
receptor signaling via IRS1 (32), whereas inhibition of
AKT has been reported to remove a feedback loop to
these and other receptor tyrosine kinases (33). AKT and
P70S6K signaling are known to have an impact on glucose
uptake and cellular metabolism, including an upregulation
of glycolysis. Therefore, blood glucose concentrations and
18F-FDG-PET imaging have potential as pharmacodynam-
ic, proof-of-principle biomarkers of altered pathway out-
put following inhibition of these kinases. In the nonfasted
animals used in the BT474c pharmacodynamic study, a
reversible, dose- and time-dependent increase in blood
glucose concentration was observed; this was still seen,
but attenuated in magnitude, in fasted animals. Similar
data have been reported with GSK690693 (34). Moreover,
an acute dose of AZD5363 can cause a reduction in 18F-FDG

in U87-MG xenografts, using static imaging. This effect
correlates with pPRAS40 pharmacodynamics in the same
tumor samples, and a dose-dependent reduction in tumor
volume following chronic dosing in the same xenograft
model. The exact mechanisms by which AZD5363 causes a
reduction in 18F-FDG uptake, however, are not fully under-
stood and could be due to various processes; therefore,
further experiments are merited using dynamic 18F-FDG-
PET to provide information on the metabolic rate of glu-
cose utilization following drug administration.

In contrast to inhibitors with mTOR kinase (35, 36),
AZD5363 has much less broad activity in panels of tumor
cell lines in vitro. Indeed, using a GI50 value of 3 mmol/L as
a cutoff, only 41 of 182 (23%) of the cell lines were classiﬁed
as sensitive. Breast cancer cell lines showed the highest
frequency of sensitivity, and our data are consistent with
previously published data with an allosteric AKT inhib-
itor, showing that breast cancer cell lines with HER2
ampliﬁcation and positivity for the ER are sensitive to
AKT inhibition (37). Two prostate cancer cell lines with
PTEN loss were also particularly sensitive to AZD5363.
Luminal breast cancers and prostate cancers have a high
frequency of PIK3CA mutation and PTEN loss respec-
tively, whereas having a low frequency of RAS-RAF
pathway mutations; moreover HER2 is a strong activator
of PI3K-AKT signaling. Therefore, these tumor types
appear to be addicted to AKT signaling and are sensitive
to monotherapy inhibition by AZD5363. In contrast, cell
lines from colon and bladder cancers, which have a high
frequency of RAS mutation, are virtually all resistant to
AZD5363 monotherapy, even though coincident PIK3CA
mutations are present in many of them. Therefore, we
sought to determine whether there was a relationship
between PIK3CA, PTEN, and RAS mutations, and sensi-
tivity to monotherapy AZD5363, collectively analyzing all
the cell lines derived from the various tumor types. The
presence of PIK3CA or PTEN mutations signiﬁcantly
correlated with sensitivity to AZD5363, regardless of RAS
status, but was very highly signiﬁcant when coincident
RAS mutations were excluded from the analysis; that is,
PIK3CA or PTEN mutation/RAS wild-type predicts very
highly for sensitivity to AZD5363. The presence of RAS
mutation is associated with AKT independence due to
redundant activation of cap-dependent translation by
convergent regulation of the translational repressor 4E-
BP1 by the AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) pathways (38). It, therefore, follows that tumor
types such as breast and prostate cancers may be enriched
for responders to an AKT inhibitor such as AZD5363,
whereas tumor types with coincident RAS mutations,
such as colorectal and endometrial cancers, may require
combinations with ERK pathway inhibitors. This having
been said, there are mechanisms other than RAS activa-
tion that may limit sensitivity to AZD5363. For example,
the MCF-7 cell line has a PIK3CA mutation, high P70S6K
expression, and wild-type RAS genes, but is considerably
 1.6
less sensitive to AZD5363 growth inhibition (GI50
mmol/L) than the most sensitive breast and prostate

cancer cell lines (GI50s < 0.1 mmol/L); the reason for this
comparatively lower sensitivity may be AKT-indepen-
dent signaling via SGK3 (39). Our ﬁndings with AZD5363
are consistent with reports that HER2 ampliﬁed and
PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cell lines were selectively
sensitive and KRAS mutant lines resistant to apoptosis
induction by the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 (35, 40).
However, PTEN loss of function was associated with
resistance to BEZ235 in breast cancer cell lines (40),
whereas it is associated with sensitivity to AZD5363 in
our cross-tumor cell line panel, suggesting that AKT
inhibitors may potentially be more effective in tumors
with PTEN loss. This merits further investigation.

The ﬁnding that tumor types with either PIK3CA muta-
tion, HER2 ampliﬁcation, or PTEN loss are particularly
sensitive to AZD5363 in vitro, logically led us to test the
hypothesis that xenografts containing one or a combina-
tion of these lesions would be sensitive to AZD5363
monotherapy dosing in vivo. Dose-dependent antitumor
activity was showed in 4 such models. At the highest
doses tested, stasis was observed in a HER2-ampliﬁed,
PIK3CA mutant breast cancer xenograft, and regressions
obtained in another HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer model
that was resistant to trastuzumab (HCC-1954), a clear cell
renal cancer xenograft with PTEN and VHL loss (786-0),
and a gastric cancer model with both PIK3CA mutation
and PTEN loss (HGC-27). AZD5363 also greatly enhanced
the antitumor activity of trastuzumab and lapatinib in the
KPL-4 HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer model, which only
showed a modest, progressive disease response to mono-
therapy doses of these drugs. The data collectively indi-
cate that AZD5363 has the potential to increase response
or overcome resistance to HER2-targeting therapies in
breast cancer. Other inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
network have also been shown to increase the response or
overcome resistance to HER2-targeting agents in breast
cancer models (41, 42). Interestingly, the HCC-1954 mod-
el, which is innately resistant to trastuzumab, expresses
high levels of P95HER2, a truncated form of HER2 that
lacks the extracellular ligand-binding domain. The pres-
ence of this truncated form of HER2 has been reported to
correlate with trastuzumab resistance and poor progno-
sis; however, these tumor types may beneﬁt from treat-
ment with an AKT inhibitor such as AZD5363 (43, 44).

Given that AKT has substrates that can mediate prolif-
eration and resistance to apoptosis, it was surprising to
ﬁnd that AZD5363 monotherapy had an antiproliferative,
rather than proapoptotic mechanism of action, at thera-
peutically relevant doses in vitro. Cell death in more than
10% of the cells and biomarkers of apoptosis were only
observed in one breast and 2 prostate cancer lines in vitro.
In the breast cancer cell line where apoptosis was observed

in vitro, it was possible to achieve waves of apoptosis and
tumor regression in vivo, by a high, intermittent dosing
schedule, whereas an equivalent AUC delivered by a
continuous lower dosing schedule was only sufﬁcient to
achieve stasis and inhibition of proliferation in vivo. AKT is
known to mediate resistance to cell death by chemother-
apy; we have shown that combination of AZD5363 with
docetaxel can result in sustained and profound tumor
regression, and by implication, increased apoptosis in 2
breast cancer xenografts. This was achievable with doses of
AZD5363 that only cause partial inhibition of tumor
growth or stasis as monotherapy. Therefore, the proapop-
totic potential of an AKT inhibitor is more likely to be
manifested in combination with chemotherapy, than when
dosed as a monotherapy. It is possible that the PKA
pharmacology of AZD5363 also contributes to the sensi-
tization to apoptosis that we have observed in combination
with chemotherapy; inhibiting PKA can decrease RelA
phosphorylation that is able to induce cell death in NF-kB
expressing, chemoresistant tumor cell lines (45, 46).

In conclusion, AZD5363 is a potent inhibitor of AKT
with a pharmacologic proﬁle consistent with its mecha-
nism of action in vitro and in vivo. Tumor types with
PIK3CA mutation, PTEN mutation, or HER2 ampliﬁca-
tion, without coincident RAS mutation, show the highest
frequency of response to AZD5363 in vitro; in such tumor
types, stasis or regression is achievable by monotherapy
dosing in vivo. AZD5363 also has potential to overcome
resistance or increase sensitivity to HER2 inhibitors in
breast cancer, and greatly sensitizes to docetaxel chemo-
therapy, resulting in tumor regression in vivo. AZD5363 is
currently in phase I clinical trials.
