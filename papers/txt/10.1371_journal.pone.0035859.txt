Abstract

The transcriptional effects of the ovarian hormone progesterone are pleiotropic, and binding to DNA of the nuclear
progesterone receptor (PR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, results in diverse outcomes in a range of target tissues.
To determine whether distinct patterns of genomic interaction of PR contribute to the cell specificity of the PR
transcriptome, we have compared the genomic binding sites for PR in breast cancer cells and immortalized normal breast
cells. PR binding was correlated with transcriptional outcome in both cell lines, with 60% of progestin-regulated genes
associated with one or more PR binding regions. There was a remarkably low overlap between the PR cistromes of the two
cell lines, and a similarly low overlap in transcriptional targets. A conserved PR binding element was identified in PR binding
regions from both cell lines, but there were distinct patterns of enrichment of known cofactor binding motifs, with FOXA1
sites over-represented in breast cancer cell binding regions and NF1 and AP-1 motifs uniquely enriched in the immortalized
normal line. Downstream analyses suggested that differential cofactor availability may generate these distinct PR cistromes,
indicating that cofactor levels may modulate PR specificity. Taken together these data suggest that cell-specificity of PR
binding is determined by the coordinated effects of key binding cofactors.

Introduction

Considerable effort has been applied over several decades to
understanding the molecular mechanisms of progesterone signal-
ling in target tissues such as the breast and endometrium. From
comprehensive in vitro studies a detailed picture has emerged.
Progesterone regulates transcription via its nuclear receptor (PR),
which associates with specific target sites on chromatin. The
consensus DNA sequence to which PR binds
(progesterone
response element (PRE)) consists of a six base pair inverted repeat
sequence: RGNACAnnnTGTNCY [1,2,3]. DNA-bound PR
recruits
transcriptional coactivators and associated cofactors,
which modify the local chromatin structure and facilitate
transcriptional activation, resulting in activation or repression of
PR target genes
In addition to coregulators and
cofactors, which associate with the PR regulatory complex by
protein-protein interaction, PR recruits chromatin remodelling
factors, which modify local DNA architecture to enhance PR
interaction and transcriptional activation [8]. Factors known to be
involved in chromatin remodelling at progestin-regulated sites
include the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex [8,9] and
transcription factor NF1, which cooperates with PR for binding
and activation of MMTV [10,11]. For other nuclear receptors
including estrogen (ER) and androgen receptor (AR), pioneer
factors such as FOXA1, which interact with condensed chromatin,
are required for nuclear receptor activation of transcriptional
targets [12,13,14,15,16,17]. In addition to direct interaction with
DNA at PREs, PR has been reported to associate with target genes

[4,5,6,7].

via tethering to other transcription factors, including AP-1, SP1
and Stat3 [18,19,20,21,22].

Although the critical determinants governing the transcriptional
activity of PR have been described in vitro, the molecular basis for
the strikingly pleiomorphic roles for this hormone in vivo are poorly
understood. Progesterone is critical for normal reproductive tissue
function [23] and in the uterus supports differentiation, and
inhibits proliferation [24]. By contrast, in the breast progesterone
is associated with increased proliferation, ductal side-branching
and lobuloalveolar development [25]. Consistent with the distinct
effects of progesterone in these two tissues, there are distinct
transcriptional responses to progesterone in breast and endome-
trium [23,26,27,28,29,30].

[31,32,33,34]. Interestingly, progestins regulate different

risk may be mediated by altered specificity of progestin action in
the cancerous breast. If altered cell-specificity of PR underlies the

determine the contribution of these variables to the cell-specificity
of PR in normal breast and breast cancer cells, we used genome-
wide PR chromatin immunoprecipitation, coupled with high-
throughput sequencing to compare PR interaction on genomic
DNA in two cell lines: T-47D cells and in MCF-10A immortalized
normal breast cells stably expressing both PR isoforms. We report
here on the discovery and characterisation of strikingly different
PR cistromes in these two cell lines.

Results

Generation of genome-wide PR interaction profiles

PR genomic interactions were mapped in T-47D breast cancer
cells and in the AB32 cell line: a stable PR expressing clone of the
MCF-10A immortalized normal breast cell line. Cells were treated
with the progestin ORG2058 (10 nM, 45 minutes), followed by
PR-chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Illumina sequenc-
ing. Sequences were aligned to the human genome and genomic
regions enriched in the alignments were identified using the
Bowtie [36] and ERANGE [37] software tools (false discovery rate
0.27%).

In T-47D cells, 6312 peaks of PR binding were identified and in
AB32 cells 8117 binding regions were detected (Table 1). Most PR
binding regions (88% in T-47D and 73% in AB32) were within
100 kb of the nearest gene, with 57% of binding regions in T-47D
and 54% in AB32 within 50 kb. However, few binding regions
(21% in T-47D and 20% in AB32) fell within 10 kb of a gene TSS
(Table 1). The distribution of distances from the nearest gene
transcription start site (TSS) for each of the PR binding regions in
T-47D and AB32 cells is shown in Figure 1A and 1B, respectively.
PR binding regions were detected on all chromosomes and the
number of binding sites per chromosome reflected chromosome
size and number of genes, although some variability was observed.
Linear regression analysis of binding regions against gene number
per chromosome in T-47D (Figure 1C) and AB32 (Figure 1D) cells
revealed a stronger correlation to gene number in the AB32 cells
(R2 = 0.76 in AB32 compared to R2 = 0.58 in T-47D). Overall
there was a correlation between numbers of binding regions per
lines (R2 = 0.66, Figure S1),
chromosome between the two cell
however
some exceptions were noted. Binding regions on
chromosomes 2 and 8 were under-represented in the T-47D
dataset compared to AB32, whereas regions on chromosome 11
were over-represented. The karyotype of T-47D cells [38] shows
significant rearrangement and duplication compared to AB32 cells
and this may partly explain the binding differences observed since
T-47D cells contain 4 rather than 2 copies of chromosome 11.
However, chromosome 2 is normal in T-47D cells, yet binding to
regions on this chromosome were half as frequent as were detected
in AB32 cells. Functional annotation of regulated genes on
chromosome 2 that were bound by PR in AB32 revealed
enrichment in genes involved in metabolism (Table S1), suggesting
an altered or attenuated metabolic response to progestins in the
cancer cell line.

Relationship between PR genomic interaction and
transcriptional response

Gene expression profiling conducted in parallel with ChIP-seq
revealed that PR binding regions were concentrated around
regulated genes. The density of PR binding regions per gene was
higher for regulated genes (density of binding regions per regulated
gene: 2.23 in T-47D cells, 2.19 in AB32 cells; Table 1) than the
overall PR binding region density (0.73 per gene for all genes in T-
47D cells, 0.74 in AB32 cells; Table 1). In addition, PR binding
peaks were more likely to be within 50 kb of the gene transcription

start site in regulated genes (74% and 69% of regulated genes in T-
47D and AB32 cells), compared with the proportion of PR binding
regions within 50 kb of all genes (57% of PR binding regions
within 50 kb of TSSs in T-47D cells, 54% in AB32 cells, Table 1).
PR binding regions in T-47D cells were on average closer to up-
regulated gene TSSs than regions near down-regulated genes. In
T-47D cells the median distance of PR binding to up-regulated
genes was 44 kb, whereas median distance to down-regulated
genes was 75 kb (Figure 1E). This was reflected in a statistically
significant overall difference in the cumulative frequency distribu-
tions of binding region distances to up-regulated and down-
regulated genes in this cell
line (Figure 1E, p = 0.001, Kolmo-
gorov-Smirnov two-sample test).
In contrast, no significant
difference was seen in binding region distribution with respect to
up- and down-regulated genes in AB32 cells (Figure 1F, p = 0.305).
In addition to PR binding regions being closer to up-regulated
genes, there were more PR binding regions near up-regulated
genes, with an average 2.3 binding regions per up-regulated gene
compared with 1.5 per down-regulated gene in T-47D cells and
2.4 and 1.9 average regions per up- and down-regulated gene,
respectively,
(Table 1). Moreover, a higher
proportion of up-regulated genes (509/786 - 65% of up-regulated
genes in T-47D and 439/546 - 80% of up-regulated genes in
AB32) were associated with PR binding regions than down-
regulated genes (50/98 - 51% of down-regulated genes in T-47D
and 325/621 - 52% of down-regulated genes in AB32, Table 1).

in AB32 cells

PR binding is associated with transcriptional regulation
The majority of regulated genes in both cell lines (559/950 in T-
in AB32, Figure 2A and B,
47D (59%) and 749/1249 (60%)
Table 1) had one or more PR binding region within 100 kb. There
was a stronger association between PR binding and transcriptional
regulation at earlier time points after ORG treatment, suggesting
that genes that are directly regulated by PR are more likely to be
detected early at the transcriptional
level than those that are
indirect targets (Figure S2). This relationship was strongest in T-
47D cells, and in AB32 cells was true only for binding regions that
were relatively near the TSS of regulated genes, as shown by the
higher representation of promoter proximal PR binding regions
(59UTR and up to 10 kb upstream) at earlier times in both cell
lines (Figure 2C and D). The overall distribution of PR binding
regions with respect to intragenic and intergenic regions was
similar in both cell lines (Figure S3): the greatest proportion of PR
binding regions was observed upstream and in the 59UTR of
regulated genes, representing 43–45% of regions associated with
regulated genes.

Self-organizing map (SOM) clustering of progestin-regulated
transcripts associated with PR binding regions in T-47D cells
(Figure 2E) and analysis of corresponding binding regions showed
that PR binding regions were significantly closer to the TSSs of
rapidly up-regulated genes, than to TSSs of down-regulated genes,
or genes regulated at a later time point (Kruskal-Wallis one-way
analysis of variance, p value,0.001, Figure 2F - compare clusters
0–5 with 6–8). Self-organizing map clustering of all progestin
regulated transcripts revealed a pattern of regulation that was
overall similar to that observed with the subset of genes associated
with PR binding (Figure S4). However, a cluster of 26 transcripts
was detected in the larger dataset representing transcripts that
were decreased at all time points, but showed some recovery at
24 h. Although 12 transcripts in this cluster were also present in
the set of transcripts associated with PR binding, 14 were found
only in the full progestin regulated transcriptome, and represented
transcripts that were regulated early but largely recovered by 24 h,

suggesting that transcriptional silencing mediated by direct PR
binding may be more sustained than indirect regulation.

In AB32 cells more transcripts were decreased than increased
(Figure S5) and there was no significant difference in mean binding
region to TSS distance observed between regulation clusters
(Kruskal-Wallis p value = 0.209, not shown).

Distinct patterns of PR binding between cell lines reflects
divergent transcriptional response

Of the 6312 regions bound by PR in T-47D and 8117 in AB32,
the combined total) were
just 1824 binding regions (14% of
common to both cell lines, representing 29% of binding regions in
T-47D and 22% of AB32 binding regions (Figure 3). The binding
regions common to both cell
lines were not more likely to be
associated with regulated genes: of the 1824 binding regions found
in both AB32 and T-47D, 431 (24%) were associated with
progestin regulation in AB32 and 345 (19%) in T-47D - similar to
the association of all binding regions with regulated genes shown
in Table 1. Just 157 (9%) binding regions were associated with

regulated genes in both cell lines (data not shown). Examples of
binding peaks detected exclusively in one cell line or common to
both are shown in Figure S6. Directed ChIP confirmed the
differential patterns of PR binding to genes regulated in AB32, T-
47D or both cell lines (Figure S7). Moreover, direct examination of
the overlap between PR binding in T-47D and AB32 cells with
another PR cistrome in T-47D cells [39] revealed a markedly
higher overlap in binding regions between the two T-47D data sets
than to the AB32 PR data set (Figure S8).

The lack of overlap in binding sites between the two cell lines
was reflected in a similarly low overlap in transcriptional profiles at
2, 6 and 24 h of progestin treatment (Figure 3C–E). The small
overlap in progestin targets in the two cell lines was similar at all
time points examined (Figure 3E). This lack of overlap was
confirmed in two additional cell lines, ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells
and an additional PR+MCF-10A clone, AB9, which revealed a
similarly low overlap of progestin response when compared
directly with each other (Figure S9) or with the T-47D or AB32
cells.

Conserved PRE identified in PR binding regions in T-47D
and AB32 cells

De novo motif enrichment analysis of PR binding regions
associated with regulated genes
identified highly significant
enrichment of a conserved PR binding motif (Figure 4A) consistent
with previously predicted progesterone response elements (PREs).
Both the MEME-ChIP and Homer motif analysis tools identified a
consensus PR binding motif consisting of a 6 bp inverted repeat
sequence RGNACA separated by three non-specific bases,
in
agreement with classical biochemical
studies of PR binding
elements [2,3] and similar to the element briefly described recently
[39]. In addition, de novo analysis in Homer identified a highly
enriched shorter element, representing the central core of the
inverted repeat sequence (Figure 4A), suggesting that this more
strongly conserved part of the PRE is most critical for PR binding.
In T-47D cells 782/1239 PR binding regions (63%) associated
with regulated genes contained one or more full-length or core
PRE motifs (Figure S10A) and in 33% of binding regions this
included at least one highly conserved full-length PRE. In AB32
cells 62% of regulation-associated PR binding regions contained
PREs (Figure S10B). A substantial proportion of PR binding was
likely to be mediated by a direct genomic interaction with these
motifs, as there was a normal distribution of PREs about the
centre of binding regions in both T-47D and AB32 cells (Figure
S11, and one sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). A number of
binding regions in both cell lines contained more than one PRE,
although number of PREs was not correlated with peak height
(Pearson regression R-squared = 0.0048), suggesting that PRE
number was not correlated with binding strength. The position
specific probability matrix for the full-length PREs defined by de

(+)

novo motif mapping in the two cell lines was used to classify PRE
strength in all PR binding regions. PRE strength did not predict a
transcriptional outcome, since the same proportion of regulation
associated and non-associated PR binding regions contained
strong PREs (data not shown). Regulation-associated PR binding
regions were grouped based on PRE p value (Figure 4B–C, strong
(+++) - p,161025, moderate (++) - p = 161025–161023, weak/
- p.161023). By these criteria 77% regulation-
absent
associated binding regions in T-47D cells and 76% in AB32
contained one or more moderate or strong PRE (p,0.001). The
majority of PR binding regions did not contain a strong PRE,
suggesting broad flexibility in PR binding site selection and also
implying that PR binding strength is not just determined by basic
sequence and is likely influenced by secondary structure and other
DNA binding PR cofactors. PR binding peak height was positively
correlated with transcriptional outcome, suggesting that it is a
measure of binding strength. In both T-47D and AB32 cells, the
average peak height of binding regions that were within 50 kb of
an up-regulated gene was significantly greater than those that were
distant from any regulated gene (Figure 4D–E, unpaired t test, T-
47D p = 2.8961028, AB32 p = 3.861026). When PRE strength
was compared directly with peak height, no correlation was
observed, demonstrating that PRE quality alone does not
determine PR binding strength (Figure S12). This finding was
supported by directed ChIP validation of the top PR binding
regions by peak height in T-47D and AB32 cells. Analysis of these
regions revealed just two regions containing strong PREs in T-47D
and three regions in AB32 cells. Most regions in the top ten
contained moderate strength PREs, and binding of PR was
confirmed in all but one binding region in each cell line (Table S2).

analysis of up-regulation associated binding regions and of those
associated with down-regulation did not reveal enrichment of
different transcription factor motifs (not shown).

The pioneer factor FOXA1 alters PR transcriptional
response

FOXA1 transcripts were abundantly expressed in T-47D and
ZR-75-1 cells relative to AB32 and AB9 cells (Figure S13),
suggesting that endogenous levels of FOXA1 may play a role in
regulating the PR transcriptional response. Accordingly, AB32
cells lacking endogenous levels of FOXA1 were infected with
lentiviral-delivered FOXA1 (Figure 5). This resulted in a profound
alteration in the progestin-regulated transcriptome at 6 h and 24 h
(Figure 5A). FOXA1 transduction resulted in progestin regulation
of 303 transcripts that were not regulated in cells transduced only
with the control pCDH virus (Figure 5C). Almost half of these
targets (146/303, 48%) were detected as a distinct cassette of genes

enrichment

We analysed the sequences up to 400 bp from each binding
peak for the presence of other enriched motifs. Binding regions in
T-47D cells were significantly enriched with motifs for the pioneer
factor FOXA1 (Figure 4F), whereas there was no significant
enrichment for this factor in PR binding regions from AB32 cells.

that clustered together (Figure 5A, red bar). Functional analysis
revealed that genes that gained progestin regulation after FOXA1
expression were involved in blood vessel morphogenesis and
regulation of cell motility (Table S3 and data not shown). These
categories included genes such as transforming growth factor b3,
CD44 and basic fibroblast growth factor, suggesting a broader
developmental
function. Surprisingly, a large proportion of

these had been increased by progestins in absence of FOXA1, but
lost progestin responsiveness when FOXA1 was expressed (Table
S3 and data not shown). Genes in this category that were

suggesting that the net effect of FOXA1 was to promote apoptosis
in response to progestin. The dampening effect of FOXA1
expression on progestin regulation suggested that the pioneer
factor may play a dual role in PR action, similar to its role in
androgen receptor signalling where it acts as an activator on a
subset of androgen targets and a corepressor on others [40]. The
progestin regulation of
just 168 transcripts was unaffected by
changed FOXA1 levels (Figure 5C). Functional analysis of these
genes revealed progestin-mediated increases in genes involved in
cell cycle progression, suggesting that the proliferative effects of
progestin may not require FOXA1.

As FOXA1 appeared to have an effect on PR transcription
distinct from that observed for ER, we compared the density of
FOXA1 ChIP-seq interactions [41] around PR binding regions in
T-47D cells, with those observed at FOXA1 or ER binding

Figure 5. Introduction of FOXA1 into AB32 cells alters progestin response. (A) Unsupervised cluster analysis of transcriptional profiles in
response to progestin in AB32 cells in the presence and absence of FOXA1. AB32 cells were transduced for 24 h with viral particles comprising the

measured by whole genome microarray. Genes that were differentially expressed at any time point in ORG-treated cells compared to control were
analysed by unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis. Red - increased log fold expression, green - decreased log fold expression. (B) FOXA1 protein

regions (Figure 5D). Binding of FOXA1 around ER binding
regions was very high, confirming the absolute requirement for
this factor in estrogen signalling. In contrast, although a peak of
FOXA1 interaction was seen near PR binding regions, sequence
enrichment was significantly lower (Figure 5D) suggesting that
while FOXA1 may be involved in PR binding at some regions, this
may represent a subset of binding events. This was supported by
the finding that FOXA1 binding was much stronger at PR binding
regions in which a FOXA1 motif had been predicted, than in
regions where no motif was found, and was similar to the density
of binding observed overall in ER binding regions (Figure S14). In
order to test whether PR binding site numbers were different near
genes that gained progestin-regulation upon FOXA1 expression,
we compared the number of PR binding peaks in FOXA1
negative AB32 cells that were near to genes that lost, gained or
retained progestin regulation when FOXA1 was expressed.
Although there were slightly fewer PR binding regions near genes

bending activity [42,43,44]. We speculated that PR binding
regions that require FOXA1 to affect transcription may be further
from the target gene than those that do not, and that binding of
FOXA1 near those regions results in DNA bending, which brings
the PR transcriptional complex closer
to the target gene.
Examination of the distance from PR binding regions to genes
that gained regulation by FOXA1 revealed that this was the case
and that this subset of regions was significantly further from the

absence of FOXA1 (Figure 5F, p = 0.003, unpaired t test).

In summary, ChIP-seq profiling in two different cell lines has
revealed remarkably distinct patterns of PR binding. These distinct
cistromes are reflected in marked differences in transcriptional
response to progestins. PR binding in the two cell lines is mediated
by highly similar PREs, suggesting a similar mode of DNA
interaction, but key differences in cofactor binding site enrich-
ment, particularly FOXA1, suggest that the expression levels of
these cofactors have potential to determine cell-specific binding
and ligand response.

Discussion

This

first detailed genome-wide survey of PR genomic
interaction has identified non-overlapping PR binding sites in
immortalized normal and malignant breast cells; shown that PR
interactions occurred distal to proximal promoters, supporting the
view that PR effects are mediated over a longer distance than has
previously been expected for direct cis-acting transcription factors;
and demonstrated that transcriptional cofactors are important
contributors to cell-specific PR activity.

PR binding regions are distant from TSS

Most PR binding regions were located more than 10 kb from
the TSS of regulated genes, with less than 35% of regulated genes
in both cell lines having PR binding regions within 10 kb of the
TSS, and less than 4% of regulated genes having binding regions
within 1 kb of the TSS. In both breast cell types, binding was
correlated with gene regulation, with most progestin-regulated
genes having one or more PR binding regions within 50 kb, and
genes increased by progestin being more likely to be associated
with PR binding sites than genes that were decreased. These
for other nuclear
findings are consistent with observations

systems. Reddy et al
identified 4392 glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding sites (2%
FDR) by ChIP-seq in dexamethasone-treated A549 cells [45].
Welboren et al
identified between 7713 and 10205 estrogen-
dependent ER binding sites, depending on the peak-calling
algorithm used,
[46]. Both ER and GR
demonstrate a correlation between binding and gene regulation,
and in line with the findings of
this study, a relatively low
proportion of promoter proximal binding is reported [14,45,46].
The stronger correlation between binding and transcriptional up-
regulation than down-regulation has also been described for ER
[14] and GR [45].

in MCF-7 cells

The number of PR binding sites discovered markedly exceeded
the number of progestin-regulated transcriptional
targets and
many PR binding sites were not associated with active transcrip-
tion, as only 20% of PR binding regions were associated with
transcriptional regulation in each cell line. This has been found for
other nuclear receptors [14,17,45,46]. A number of potential
explanations are proposed [47]. Some binding events may regulate
transcription at a level below the detection threshold of genome-
wide expression profiling. Moreover, a subset of binding sites may
represent weaker associations or binding occurring in only a subset
of cells such that transcriptional regulation does not occur at a

assumed that a proportion of binding regions represent non-
specific interactions, although the finding that PREs are similarly
prevalent
in regulation-associated and non-associated binding
regions would argue that non-specific interaction explains a small
component of overall binding.

PREs in PR binding regions

PR binding regions were significantly enriched for a binding
element with a sequence consistent with previously described
progesterone response elements [2,3]. The relative conservation at
specific base positions in the 15 bp palindromic response elements
was variable, and was consistent with the pattern of conservation
seen for GR [45,49] and AR [50]. A shorter motif, representing
the core highly conserved elements
(CA/t nnn TGTnC,
Figure 4A), was also detected, demonstrating the particular
importance of these positions in the PR binding element. There
was a high degree of variability of PRE sequences, as indicated by
the consensus sequence allowing for marked variation at several
positions, and many binding regions contained weak sequences
that diverged considerably from the ideal. Moreover, a proportion
of PR binding regions totally lacked a consensus PRE, raising the
question of whether these were directly binding PR. To address
this, we sought motif enrichment just in those regions, and did
identify a PRE-like motif at a lower level of significance (not
shown). This suggests that many binding regions lacking consensus
PREs do contain sequences consistent with a PRE. A similar
finding was reported for GR [45].

Although there was variability in the presence and strength of
PREs identified in PR binding regions, this was not a determinant
of whether a particular region was associated with transcriptional
activity, as PRE strength was not correlated either with PR
binding peak strength or with transcriptional outcome. This
suggests that PRE strength is not the sole determinant of whether
PR will interact with a particular binding region and regulate gene
expression, and that other sequence features and the influence of
DNA binding cofactors are likely to be important determinants.
This is supported by the identification of FOXA1, AP-1 and NF1
as potential cell type-specific binding cofactors for PR in the two
cell lines examined.

The PR cistromes in T-47D and AB32 cells are non-
overlapping

There was a relatively small overlap in PR binding regions in T-
47D and AB32 cells. This was consistent with the observation that
the transcriptional response to progestin was also non-overlapping
between the two cell lines. Moreover, binding regions that were
common to both cell lines were not more likely to be associated
with a transcriptional outcome. Expression profiling in two
additional cell
lines, ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells and an
independent PR positive MCF-10A clone (AB9), revealed a
similarly low overlap in transcriptional regulation by progestins. It
is important to note that the difference in PR cistromes observed
in T-47D and AB32 cells may be contributed by lineage
differences between these cells. MCF-10A cells (from which
AB32 are derived) are considered to be myoepithelial in character,
whereas T-47D cells have luminal characteristics. It is therefore
possible that myoepithelial cells may respond differently to
progesterone than luminal cells, even when PR is ectopically
expressed, although confirmation of this possibility would require
direct comparison of ectopic expression of PR into normal and
malignant
luminal or myoepithelial cells. Comparison of ER
binding patterns in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and ER expressing
U2OS osteosarcoma cells revealed a similarly low overlap in
binding sites and transcriptomes [48]. In that study, differential

promoter methylation was proposed to underlie this difference.
However, global inhibition of DNA methylation in AB32 cells,
while enhancing existing transcriptional targets, did not signifi-
cantly alter the progestin-responsive transcriptome (data not
shown). In support of our findings, Yin and colleagues have
recently reported a similarly low overlap in PR genomic
interactions in T-47D cells and uterine leiomyoma cells on
exposure to the antagonist RU486 [51]. Cofactor motif enrich-
ment was also found to be different between the two cell lines,
however, some care should be taken in the interpretation of these
data as no negative control or biological replicates for ChIP-seq
were included in the study. Comparison of our T-47D and AB32
PR cistromes with a publicly available dataset revealed a markedly
greater overlap between the two T-47D datasets (51% reported T-
47D PR binding sites were also found in T-47D in our study) than
with binding in AB32 cells (28%), supporting the validity of the
observation of distinct binding patterns. The level of overlap in PR
binding sites in T-47D cells from the two different studies was
possibly influenced by a number of factors. The use of different
ligands would influence the detection of PR binding sites. In the
published study T-47D cells were treated with progesterone, which
has a similar pharmacokinetic profile to ORG2058, but dissociates
from PR more rapidly than the synthetic analogue. Moreover, the
mobility of PR at genomic DNA has been shown to be ligand
specific [52] and may differ when bound to ORG2058 compared
to progesterone. Secondlly, PR binding was detected by different
methods: in this study ChIP-seq was used, whereas the published
data are derived from ChIP-chip. ChIP-seq surveys binding in an
unbiased genome-wide fashion. ChIP-chip is dependent on the
sequences present on the arrays used and can be affected by
hybridization bias. A similar overlap was observed in ER binding
sites detected in MCF-7 cells by ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip [46].
Lastly, the analysis methods used to generate the published data
were likely different than used in our study. This information is not
currently available for the published data.

Role of chromatin structure and the pioneer factor
FOXA1

it plays

Pioneer factors such as FOXA1 are able to bind to tightly
packed heterochromatin, opening DNA structure to allow binding
and regulation by nuclear receptors, including ER, GR and AR
[12,14,15,17,40,53]. The level of requirement for FOXA1 and the
in receptor signalling differs between the
role that
receptors. Expression of FOXA1 is critical
for transcriptional
activation by ER, although the specific gene targets may differ
between cell
lines. In a recent study, Hurtado and colleagues
mapped ER and FOXA1 binding in three breast cancer cell lines,
MCF-7, T-47D and ZR-75-1, and determined that positioning of
the silencing factor CTCF was different between the three cell
lines and defined which ER targets were transcriptionally
enhanced by FOXA1 binding. In these cell
lines FOXA1 was
critical for ER action [15].

In contrast, FOXA1 appears to play a dual role in androgen
signalling, where it promotes androgen responsiveness of some AR
targets and acts as a repressor of others. This is supported by a
recent study in LNCaP prostate cancer cells where depletion of
FOXA1 caused significant remodelling of AR binding patterns
and a marked increase in androgen regulated transcripts [40]. In
this context FOXA1 is a critical determinant of binding site
selection and acts both as a facilitator and a repressor of AR
binding depending on the target site. Our data suggest
that
FOXA1 may play a similar role in PR signalling as with AR, since
FOXA1 was not absolutely required for progestin response and
over-expression of FOXA1 in AB32 cells, which lacked endoge-

nous FOXA1, caused a marked decrease in the number of
progestin-regulated genes in those cells. In T-47D cells where
FOXA1 is abundantly expressed, binding motifs for the pioneer
factor were statistically enriched in PR binding regions. The role
of FOXA1 in PR signaling through regions containing FOXA1
motifs was supported by the finding that FOXA1 binding levels at
these sites in T-47D cells was greater than interactions at PR
binding regions that did not contain a predicted FOXA1 motif.
However, a comparison of average FOXA1 binding around all PR
binding regions in T-47D cells with those at ER interaction sites
revealed significantly lower overall enrichment of FOXA1 binding
near PR than ER, suggesting that FOXA1 is not required for all
PR interactions. Taken together, our data suggest that FOXA1
may act as an enhancer of PR transcriptional activation of many of
the targets identified in T-47D, whereas in AB32 cells the lack of
FOXA1 expression allows binding of PR targets
that may
normally be repressed by FOXA1.

The overlap between progestin regulation in T-47D and
FOXA1 transduced AB32 cells was low, suggesting that FOXA1
expression did not cause AB32 cells to become more like T-47D
cells in their progestin response. This is consistent with our
observation that FOXA1 may not be absolutely required for all
PR binding events in T-47D cells. It also suggests that, although
FOXA1 may affect PR binding, other cell specific factors or
characteristics are important in determining PR binding, which
may not be identifiable by ChIP. Both ER and AR have been
shown to associate with histone modifying factors in a cell-type
and promoter-specific fashion [54,55], which are recruited to
enhancers as part of a large coregulatory complex and would not
be identifiable through motif analysis. The nature of the GR
cistrome has been shown to be highly dependent on chromatin
accessibility [56], which is also cell type specific. It is likely that the
same factors influence PR binding in a cell type specific fashion.

AP-1 and NF-1

Nuclear receptors, including PR, have been shown to associate
with DNA independently of hormone response elements, by
tethering to AP-1 [18,19,20]. In the case of ER, this mechanism
was reported to mediate transcriptional repression of
target
transcripts by estrogen [14]. These findings suggest that AP-1
binding sites may be more common in binding regions that lack
PREs and could be associated with down-regulated genes. AP-1
sites were present in 27% of regions that contained PREs and 29%
of regions lacking PREs in AB32 binding regions. This proportion
was higher overall than in T-47D cells where AP-1 site enrichment
was not observed (12% regions with PREs and 10.7% regions
lacking PREs contained AP-1 sites in T-47D), however it was not
different between the two subsets of binding regions. There was
also no evidence that AP1 sites were more prevalent in down-
regulated than up-regulated genes (data not shown). These data
suggest that, while AP-1 may co-operate with PR on a subset of
binding sites in AB32 cells, its role in progesterone signaling may
be more minor than for estrogen.

Binding of the transcriptional cofactor NF1 to DNA requires co-
association by PR, and NF1 and PR have synergistic effects on
gene expression [11], demonstrating the potential
for co-
expression of these transcription factors to result in enhanced
transcriptional outcomes. In the mammary gland, the coordinated
expression of NF1 isoforms is involved in controlling lactation and
involution [57]. NF1 action in the mammary gland is context-
specific, and is induced when mammary epithelial cells are
maintained in contact with laminin-rich extracellular matrix [58].
The development-specific and context-specific actions of NF1 in
the mammary gland suggest that its interplay with PR may be

regulated by both NF1 and PR levels, and that these may be
susceptible to modulation under physiological circumstances that
include carcinogenesis. Enrichment of NF1 binding motifs in PR
binding regions in AB32 cells, but not breast cancer cells, supports
this view and suggests that NF1 is a cell
type-restricted PR
cofactor.

Our data suggest that a combination of chromatin remodelling
cofactors is important for progesterone response in the breast and
that
these
cofactors determines the PR cistrome. Progesterone has a diverse
range of effects in normal and malignant target tissues and the
results of this study demonstrate that the interplay between key
cofactors and PR on the progesterone regulated cistrome
contributes to context specificity of progesterone action, and
may play a central role in aberrant progestin effects in breast
cancer.

Methods

Cell culture

T-47D and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines were obtained from
the E.G. and G. Mason Research Institute (Worcester, MA).
MCF-10A immortalized normal breast cells and HEK293T
kidney cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (atcc.org, Manassas, VA). T-47D and ZR-75-1 cells
were maintained in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf
serum and 0.25 units/ml insulin. HEK293T were maintained in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum. The AB32 and AB9 cell lines were generated by
co-introduction of PRA and PRB from viral vectors into the MCF-
10A cell line and clonal selection using puromycin. Clones were
characterised by dual immunofluorescent analysis and by western
blotting for expression of PRA and PRB. A western blot
comparing PR expression in AB32 and AB9 with PR levels in
T-47D cells is shown in Figure S15. The cells were maintained in
1:1 DMEM:Hams-F12 medium supplemented with cholera toxin
(0.1 mg/ml),
insulin (0.28 iu/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 mg/ml),
epidermal growth factor (0.02 mg/ml), and 5% horse serum. The
synthetic progestin ORG2058 was obtained from Amersham
Biosciences (GE Healthcare, Rydalmere, Australia). TSA and
5AdC were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Castle Hill, Australia).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation

Cells were cultured to 80% confluency in 15 cm tissue culture
dishes, then treated for 45 minutes with 10 nM ORG or vehicle.
Chromatin was subsequently cross-linked by the addition of
formaldehyde to the culture medium to a final concentration of
1% and incubation for 10 minutes at 37uC. Media were
immediately removed and the cells were washed with cold
phosphate buffered saline and harvested by scraping. Cells were
collected by centrifugation and pellets were lysed 10 minutes at
4uC in SDS buffer (1% SDS; 10 mM EDTA; 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8). The lysates were sonicated at 4uC with a Branson 450
sonicator, using seven one minute bursts at 40% amplitude and
60% duty, each separated by a rest of at least one minute. Lysates
were centrifuged at 13,0006 g at 4uC for 15 minutes to remove
debris. Genomic DNA was isolated from an aliquot of lysate and
checked by gel electrophoresis to confirm that sonication had
resulted in fragmented DNA with an average size of 200 to
400 bp. Supernatants were diluted 1:10 with IP buffer (0.5% NP-
40; 50 mM Tris, pH 8; 120 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM PMSF; Complete
protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche, Ryde, Australia) and pre-
cleared using washed Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG
magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Mulgrave, Australia), with gentle

rotation at 4uC for at least 2 h. Genomic DNA fragments that
were bound to PR were isolated by rotation overnight at 4uC with
in-house hPRa6 and hPRa7 mouse monoclonal anti-PR antibod-
ies [59] and fresh sheep anti-mouse IgG magnetic beads (40 ul per
1.4 ml diluted lysate). Beads were washed sequentially with IP
buffer, high salt wash buffer (0.5% NP-40, 50 mM Tris, pH 8,
500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM PMSF), lithium wash buffer (250 mM
LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 8, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) and TE (10 mM Tris, pH 8,
1 mM EDTA). Isolated DNA fragments were eluted twice for
15 minutes at room temperature using elution buffer (1% SDS,
0.1 M NaHCO3). Cross-links were reversed by addition of NaCl
to 0.25 M and heating to 65uC for at least 6 h. DNA fragments
were purified using Qiagen PCR purification columns (Qiagen,
Doncaster, Australia). DNA fragments isolated by PR chromatin
immunoprecipitation from ORG-treated cells were sequenced on
an Illumina GA-IIx sequencer at the Ramaciotti Centre for Gene
Function Analysis (University of New South Wales, Australia) and
GeneWorks (Hindmarsh, Australia). Input DNA isolated from the
pre-cleared ORG-treated samples were sequenced as a baseline
control.

Analysis

Sequences were aligned to repeat masked human genome hg18
(NCBI build 36) using Bowtie 0.12.0.1 [36]. Up to 2 mismatches
were allowed in the aligned sequences. Multiple alignments were
permitted up to a multiplicity of 10, but only the best ranked
alignment was reported. This strategy resulted in alignment of 42
to 48% of reads. Results in T-47D represent
the combined
outcome of
three independent biological replicates and two
replicate input controls. AB32 results are from two independent
ChIP and input control samples each. All sequences were at 36 bp
read length except for one ChIP and one matched input control
sample from T-47D cells. These samples were processed with a
64 bp read length, but were trimmed to 36 bp during data
processing to avoid bias in the downstream analysis. Enriched
regions of PR binding were determined using the ERANGE open
source software tool [37]. Peak shift was determined to be 70 bp
using the -shiftLearn function in findall.py. The peak threshold
was set at four-fold background as determined from the control
input DNA sequence. The minimum number of reads (RPM)
within a region was set to 10. Multireads were weighted at a value
of 1/multiplicity. Peaks were called with false discovery rate
0.27%. Regions of PR binding were annotated with respect to
neighbouring genes using CisGenome v1.1 [60] and Homer [61].
Known and de novo enriched binding motifs were identified using
Homer and the MEME suite of motif analysis tools, version 4
[62,63]. Significance of enrichment of binding motifs discovered in
MEME was determined using a Fisher Exact Test. The E-value
for enrichment represents the p-value multiplied by the number of
sequences tested. Motif enrichment was scored in Homer using a
cumulative hypergeometric distribution analysis comparing bind-
ing region sequences with a matched genomic background [61].
The FIMO program in MEME was used to classify full-length
PRE occurrences in PR binding regions in AB32 and T-47D cells,
using the position specific probability matrices discovered by
MEME in the two cell lines. Sequences with a p value,0.01 for
similarity to the consensus PRE were reported and p values ranged
from 0.01 to 1610210. A lower p value signified greater sequence
conservation compared to the consensus PRE and for the purposes
of comparisons, a p value,161025 was considered to represent a
strong PRE. For comparison of PR genomic interaction in T-47D
cells with published ER and FOXA1 interactomes [41], sequence
tag libraries were generated from all three data sets in Homer and

binding peaks were identified using the same parameters for each
data set. Average FOXA1 tag density was then determined at PR,
ER and FOXA1 peaks using the peak annotation function in
Homer. All raw data generated by ChIP-seq and gene expression
profiling have been deposited on the Gene Expression Omnibus
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and can be accessed through GEO
accession number GSE31130. Gene expression data conform to
MIAME guidelines.

Real-time PCR

Directed ChIP was performed using the same protocol as
described for ChIP-seq. Target templates were quantitated using
Platinum Sybr Green reagents (Invitrogen) in a RotorGene 6000
real-time PCR machine. Directed ChIP was carried out as
described above and purified gDNA fragments were diluted 2 to 5-
fold prior to quantitation by real-time qPCR. Primer sequences
used for specific target validation were: ACSL1 - fwd 59-TGC

Lentiviral transduction

The FOXA1 cDNA was obtained from the PlasmID Dana
Faber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core (Boston,
MA). The open reading frame was amplified by high fidelity PCR
and transferred into the multiple cloning site of pCDH-CMV-
MCS-EF1-copGFP. Integrity of
the insert was confirmed by
sequencing. Lentiviral particles were generated by cotransfecting
the pCDH-FOXA1-GFP vector and lentiviral packaging con-
structs into HEK293T cells and allowing virus to accumulate in
the medium for 48 h. Viral titre was estimated over a dilution
series in AB32 cells, using a Facs Calibur flow cytometer to
estimate GFP positivity. AB32 cells were infected at a level
predicted to give a 70% infection rate and incubated for 24 h at
37uC to allow expression of FOXA1, followed by treatment for 0,
6 and 24 h with 10 nM ORG. Matched control samples infected
with the parent pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP virus were
included at each time point.

Gene expression microarray

Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueous purification columns
(Invitrogen). Total RNA (500 ng) was amplified and biotin labelled
using Illumina TotalPrep reagents (Invitrogen). The amplified
samples (750 ng) were hybridized to human whole genome HT-12
gene expression bead arrays using the recommended Illumina
reagents and following the manufacturer’s protocol. Raw data
were analysed using Genome Studio software (Illumina). After
background subtraction data and cubic spline normalization,
differential expression p values were determined using the Illumina
custom model of Genome Studio. Data were further analysed
using Microsoft Excel and SPSS statistical software. Hierarchical
clustering and self organizing map clustering were performed
using GenePattern [64].

Protein extract preparation and immunoblotting

Cells to be analysed by protein immunoblot were harvested by
trypsinization, washed with cold phosphate buffered saline solution
and collected into a cell pellet by centrifugation. Whole cell
extracts were prepared by lysis of cells in RIPA buffer (10 mM
NaPO4 (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% sodium
deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.1% b-mercaptoethanol) containing
10 mM NaMoO4, 1% aprotinin, Complete protease inhibitor
(Roche, Castle Hill, Australia) and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl-
fluoride, and rotation 15 min at 4uC. Insoluble debris was
removed by centrifugation at 14,0006 g, 15 min at 4uC. Protein
concentration was estimated using Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad,
Regents Park, Australia). Proteins were fractionated by electro-
phoresis through denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as described previously
[65]. For detection of FOXA1 expression T-47D whole cell
extract was loaded at 100 mg per lane and transduced cell extracts
at 10 mg per lane. FOXA1 was detected using a goat anti-human
FOXA1 polyclonal antibody (Abcam ab5089, Sapphire Biosci-
ences, Waterloo, Australia) at 1:800 dilution, and rabbit anti-goat
horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Dako
Cytomation, Kingsgrove, Australia). For detection of PR protein
expression, whole cell extracts were loaded as indicated. PR was
detected using hPRa6 and hPRa7 in-house mouse monoclonal
antibodies (1:100 each) and goat anti-mouse horseradish perox-
idase conjugated secondary antibody (Dako). Protein bands were
visualized by chemiluminescent reaction using ECL reagents
(Quantum Scientific, Murrarie, Australia) and exposure to film or
imaging using a Kodak Image Station (Carestream Health,
Richmond, Australia).

Figure S7 Validation of cell type-specific PR binding
regions identified in ChIP-seq. PR binding regions identified
in (A) T-47D, (B) AB32 or (C) both cell lines by ChIP-seq were
validated by directed PR-ChIP, using binding region-specific
primers and quantitative real-time PCR. Regions bound near
ACSL1 and PACSIN1, which were regulated in T-47D but not
AB32 produced marked enrichment of bound fragments in T-47D
cells and not AB32. The converse was true with PR target regions
identified in AB32 but not T-47D. FLRT3 and DHRS9, which
are both transcriptional targets only in AB32, were strongly bound
by PR in AB32 but showed a weak association in T-47D cells.
PDK4 and Notch 2, which are progestin regulated in both cell
lines, were bound by PR in both although the association was
stronger in T-47D (85-fold vs42-fold binding enrichment of PDK-
4 and 300-fold vs37-fold enrichment of Notch 2 binding in T-47D
vs AB32).
