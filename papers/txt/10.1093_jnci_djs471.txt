 Background 

  Methods 

 

Results 

The mitogen-activated protein–kinase pathway consisting of the kinases RAF, MEK, and ERK is central to cell pro-
liferation and survival and is deregulated in more than 90% of melanomas. MEK inhibitors are currently trialled 
in the clinic, but despite efficient target inhibition, cytostatic rather than cytotoxic activity limits their efficacy.

We assessed the cytotoxicity to MEK inhibitors (PD184352 and selumetinib) in melanoma cells by toluidine-blue 
staining, caspase 3 cleavage, and melanoma-sphere growth. Western blotting and quantitative real-time poly-
merase chain reaction were applied to determine SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (SMURF2), PAX3, 
and MITF expression. Human melanoma samples (n = 77) from various stages were analyzed for SMURF2 and 
PAX3 expression. RNA interference was performed to target SMURF2 during MEK inhibition in vivo in melanoma 
xenografts in mice and zebrafish. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Activation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signalling sensitized melanoma cells to the cytotoxic effects 
of MEK inhibition. Melanoma cells resistant to the cytotoxic effects of MEK inhibitors counteracted TGF-β sig-
nalling through overexpression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2, which resulted in increased expression of 
the transcription factors PAX3 and MITF. High MITF expression protected melanoma cells against MEK inhibitor 
cytotoxicity. Depleting SMURF2 reduced MITF expression and substantially lowered the threshold for MEK inhibi-
tor–induced apoptosis. Moreover, SMURF2 depletion sensitized melanoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of selu-
metinib, leading to cell death at concentrations approximately 100-fold lower than the concentration required to 
induce cell death in SMURF2-expressing cells. Mice treated with selumetinib alone at a dosage of 10 mg/kg body 
weight once daily produced no response, but in combination with SMURF2 depletion, selumetinib suppressed 
tumor growth by 97.9% (95% confidence interval = 38.65% to 155.50%, P = .005).

 Conclusions 

Targeting SMURF2 may be a novel therapeutic approach for increasing the antitumor efficacy of MEK inhibitors.

The  mitogen-activated  protein  (MAP)–kinase  pathway,  consist-
ing of the kinases RAF, MEK, and ERK, is hyperactivated in more 
than 90% of melanomas, and this is mainly triggered by a mutated 
BRAF-kinase, which constitutively activates MEK (1,2). Currently, 
inhibitors of MEK are being evaluated in the clinic, but although 
they  show  some  single-agent  activity,  the  overall  responses  are 
much lower than expected (3,4). Importantly, the doses of MEK 
inhibitor used in reported trials effectively produce target inhibi-
tion  and  suppress  proliferation  (4,5). These  observations  suggest 
that  cytostatic  effects  may  not  be  sufficient  to  produce  a  major 
response in patients and that the majority of tumors are intrinsi-
cally refractory to cytotoxic effects of MEK inhibition.

Indeed,  from  studies  in  melanoma  cell  lines,  it  is  clear  that 
cytotoxic  effects  of  MEK  inhibitors  in  melanoma  cells  generally 
occur  either  at  concentrations  considerably  higher  than  the 
concentrations  needed  to  produce  an  antimitotic  effect  or  after 

continuous long-term exposure to the drug (6–8). However, dose-
limiting toxicity or a short half-life of the inhibitor prevents these 
conditions  being  satisfied  in  vivo  (3,5).  Moreover,  frequently 
BRAF-mutant  cells  display  high  resistance  to  MEK  inhibitor–
induced apoptosis despite efficient target inhibition (9,10), which 
points to the activation of additional pathways in these cells that 
enable them to survive even at very low levels of ERK activation. 
Thus,  in  addition  to  recently  discovered  mechanisms  reinstating 
MAP-kinase pathway activation in the presence of inhibitor (11–
14), abrogation of the cytotoxic effects of MEK inhibitors brought 
about  by  parallel  pathways  must  be  considered  as  a  possible 
resistance  mechanism.  Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase  or 
its 
upstream regulators activate such a pathway (10,15,16), and trials 
using phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathway inhibitors combined 
with  MEK  inhibitors  are  currently  underway.  However,  like  the 
MAP-kinase  pathway,  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase  signalling  is

a limiting factor (17,18).

We,  therefore,  aimed  to  identify  melanoma  specific  proteins 
that  counteract  MEK  inhibitor–induced  cytotoxic  effects.  Such 
proteins may be useful predictive markers for the sensitivity of mel-
anoma cells to MEK inhibitors. Moreover, targeting such proteins 
may 1) improve the initial response to MEK inhibitors by enhanc-
ing their cytotoxic effects, thus overcoming primary resistance, and 
2)  prevent  secondary  acquired  resistance  that  develops  from  the 
selection for primary resistant cells during drug treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture, Reagents, and Transfections
Human melanoma cell lines, derived from patients with either pri-
mary (888mel) or metastatic (A375, WM266-4, SK-Mel2, 501mel, 
and WM164) melanoma lesions, were grown in Dulbecco’s modi-
fied Eagle medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (PAA, Yeovil, 
UK).  A375,  WM266-4,  WM164,  and  SK-Mel2  cells  were  from 
American Type Culture Collection (LGC, Middlesex, UK), 501mel 
and 888mel were a gift from Steven Rosenberg (National Cancer 
Institute, Bethesda, MD). All cell lines are positive for the mela-
noma marker MITF: SK-Mel2 cells harbor an NRAS mutation, and 
the other melanoma cell lines were confirmed to harbor a BRAF 
mutation. Human dermal fibroblasts were a gift from Guillaume 
Jacquement  (University  of  Manchester,  Manchester,  UK)  and 
grown  in  Dulbecco’s  modified  Eagle  medium  containing  10% 
fetal calf serum. Normal human melanocytes (Cascade Biologics, 
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were cultured in medium 154 with human 
melanocyte growth supplement 2 (Cascade Biologics). PD184352 
was  from  Axon  Medchem  (Groningen,  The  Netherlands),  and 
selumetinib (AZD6244) was from Selleck Chemicals (Newmarket, 
UK).  Transforming  growth  factor  β  (TGF-β)  was  from  Sigma 
(St Louis, MO). Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using 
Attractene  transfection  reagent  (Qiagen, Valencia,  CA)  and  with 
small  interfering  RNAs  (siRNAs)  using  INTERFERin  siRNA-
transfection  reagent  (Polyplus,  Illkirch,  France)  according  to  the 
manufacturer’s instructions. For the generation of A375 cells stably 
transfected  with  either  the  control  vector  pLKO  or  with  differ-
ent SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (SMURF2)–spe-
cific small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), cells were transfected with the 
respective circular plasmids (set of 5 shRNAs, #RHS4533; Open 
Biosystems,  Huntsville,  AL)  and  selected  for  puromycin  (1µg/
ml) resistance. Clones S2-C4 and S2-C14 were isolated from cell 
populations transfected with different shRNA sequences. For the 
MEK inhibitor resistance colony formation assay, A375, WM266-
4, and SK-Mel28 cells were transfected with circular pEF-MITF 
or empty vector plasmids. Cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and 
incubated with 1µM PD184352 for 3 weeks before being formalin 
fixed, stained with crystal violet, and photographed. Quantification 
was achieved by spectrophotometrical analysis measuring the opti-
cal density at 555 nm (OD 555) of the solubilized dye.

Immunoblotting
Melanoma cells (3 × 105) were lysed in 150-µL sodium dodecyl sul-
fate sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-hydrochloride [pH 6.8 at 25°C], 
2% weight/volume sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 50 mM 

dithiothreitol,  0.01%  weight/volume  bromophenol  blue)  or  lysis 
buffer [50 mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 
pH  7.5,  150 mM  sodium  chloride,  1.5 mM  magnesium  chloride, 
1 mM  ethylene  glycol  tetraacetic  acid,  10%  glycerol,  1%  Triton 
X-100,  1 mM  phenylmethanesulfonyl  fluoride,  0.2 mM  sodium 
orthovanadate,  10 mg/mL  leupeptin,  10 mg/ml  aprotinin)  for  20 
minutes  at  4ºC  and  analyzed  by  standard  immunoblotting  pro-
tocols. The same amount of protein was loaded in each lane, and 
primary  antibodies  were  detected  by  luminescence  using  peroxi-
dase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson, Stratech, Newmarket, 
UK).  The  primary  antibodies  used  were:  phospho-ERK  (mouse 
monoclonal MAPK-YT, 1:10,000 dilution; Sigma); ERK2 (rabbit 
polyclonal C-14, 1:10,000 dilution), PAX3 (goat-polyclonal N-19, 
1:1000  dilution),  and  SMURF2  (rabbit  polyclonal  H-50,  1:1000 
dilution) from Santa Cruz Biotechnolgy (Santa Cruz, CA); MITF 
(mouse monoclonal, C5, 1:500 dilution; Neomarkers, Lab Vision, 
Runcorn, UK); PARP (mouse monoclonal C2-10, #556362, 1:3000 
dilution;  BD  Biosciences,  Oxford,  UK);  and  cleaved  caspase  3, 
SMAD2, and phospho-SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 (all rabbit 
polyclonal, 1:1000 dilution) from Cell Signaling (Boston, MA).

Detection of Cell Death
The  cellular  sub-G1  fraction  was  determined  by  fluorescence-
activated cell sorting using propidium iodide staining and stand-
ard protocols. Quantification of live cells was performed by crystal 
violet or toluidine blue staining of formalin-fixed cells, and subse-
quent spectrophotometrical analysis was performed by measuring 
the OD 555 of the solubilized dye.

RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase 
Chain Reaction (qPCR) Analysis
RNA  was  isolated  with  TRIZOL  reagent  (Invitrogen),  and 
selected  genes  were  amplified  by  qPCR  using  SYBR  green 
(Qiagen) incorporation during the amplification reaction. Primer 
sequences  (forward;  reverse)  were  as  follows:  PAX3  (AGGAT-
GCGGCTGATGGAACTCACTG; CCAGGATGATGCGGC-
CGGGCCC GGG); MITF (CCGTCTCTCACTGGATTGGT; 
TACTTGGTGGGGTTTTCGAG);  SMURF2  (GCAACAA-
GGCCAGGTGTATT;  ACCACTTGCTGTTGCTGTTG); 
GAPDH (CAATGACCCC TTCATTGACC; GACAAGCTTC-
CCGTTCTCAG); and β-actin (GCAAGCAGGAGT ATGAC-
GAG; CAAATAAAGCCATGCCAATC).

siRNAs and shRNAs
All 
from  Thermo  Scientific  Dharmacon 
siRNAs  were 
(Loughborough,  UK).  The  sequences  of  the  individual  siRNAs 
were  as  follows:  SMURF2#1  (GAUGAGAACACUCCAAUUA), 
(GACCAUACCUUCUGUGUUG),  SMURF2#3 
SMURF2#2 
(CAAAGUGGAAUCAGCAUUA), 
(GAACAAC 
(GAACGAAGAAGAAGAUUU 
ACAAUUUACAGA),  MITF#1

(GACCUAACCUGUACAACAAUU),  PAX3#1 
(GAAACACCG 
UGCCGUCAGUUU),  PAX3#2 
(GAGACUGGCUCCAUAC 
GUCUU) and scrambled (nontargeting) control sequence (AAUAUAA 
UCACUAUCAGGUGC);  S2-p  was  a  ready-to-use  SMURF2 
SMARTpool.  The  circular  plasmids  containing  SMURF2-specific 
shRNAs were from Open Biosystems (Thermo Fisher, Loughborough,

corresponds to clone TRCN0000003477.

Melanoma Three-Dimensional Spheroid Growth
A375  melanoma  cells  and  the  corresponding  SMURF2  shRNA 
derivatives stably expressing green fluorescent protein were resus-
pended  in  Dulbecco’s  modified  Eagle  medium  containing  5% 
fetal calf serum and 1.5% methylcellulose (Sigma). The cell sus-
pension was transferred into a 96-well plate (1000 cells per well), 
and spheres were allowed to form over a period of 48 to 72 hours. 
Spheres were then transferred into 0.5-mL fibrillar bovine dermal 
collagen  (2.3 mg/mL;  Nucaton,  Leimuiden,  The  Netherlands) 
with one sphere per well of a 24-well plate. Once the collagen was 
set, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal calf 
serum  was  added,  and  after  approximately  16  hours,  drugs  were 
added to the medium at indicated concentrations. Dead cells were 
identified  by  staining  of  nonfixed  cells  with  ethidium  bromide 
(100 µg/mL; Sigma) for 10 minutes, followed by three washes with 
phosphate-buffered  saline.  Green  fluorescent  protein–express-
ing spheres were monitored, and ethidium bromide intensity was 
assessed  using  a  Leica  DM  IL  HC  inverted  microscope  and  a 
FC340 Cooled Monocrome camera (Leica Microsysytems).

Melanoma cDNA Tissue Array
Two  melanoma  TissueScan  cDNA  arrays,  MERT101  and 
MERT102  (Origene,  Rockville,  MD),  were  analyzed  for  the 
expression of SMURF2 and PAX3. The arrays consisted of cDNA 
derived from stage III (n = 36) and stage IV (n = 41) melanomas, 
staged  according  to  the  revised  TNM  classification  with  mini-
mum  stage  grouping  (19),  and  from  normal  skin  (n  =  6),  which 
was  supplemented  with  additional  cDNA  derived  from  human 
fibroblasts,  keratinocytesm,  and  melanocytes.  The  expression  in 
melanocytes was set to one. The cDNA samples were preampli-
fied  using  the  TaqMan  PreAmp  Master  Mix  Kit  (PN4384267, 
Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. qPCR was carried out with TaqMan Gene Expression 
Master Mix (PN4369016, Applied Biosystems). β-Actin expression 
was  used  to  normalize  relative  SMURF2  and  PAX3  expression. 
Experiments  were  performed  as  multiplex  PCR  reactions  using 
TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) for SMURF2 (Hs00224203, 
FAM labelled) or PAX3 (Hs00240950, FAM labelled) with a differ-
entially labelled β-actin probe (Hs99999903, VIC labelled).

Melanoma Xenografts
All  procedures  involving  animals  were  approved  by  the  Animal 
Ethics Committees of the Institute of Cancer Research in accord-
ance  with  National  Home  Office  regulations  under  the Animals 
(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and according to the guidelines 
of the Committee of the National Cancer Research Institute (20).

Xenografts  in  Zebrafish.  Zebrafish  (Danio  rerio)  were  raised 
and  maintained  at  the  University  of  Manchester  Biological 
Services  Unit.  Zebrafish  xenografts  were  generated  by  injection 
of approximately 1000 melanoma cells into the pericardiac space 
surrounding the heart of embryos that were 48 hours postfertiliza-
tion.  Subsequently,  groups  of  six  larvae  per  condition,  randomly 
assigned were treated with either 20 nM or 100 nM PD184352 or 

the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The drug was added to the 
fish medium, and larvae were grown at 34°C ambient temperature 
in chorion water. Before drug addition (day 1) and 3 days after drug 
addition, anesthetized larvae (MS222, Sigma) were imaged using a 
Leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). Images were 
processed using Volocity software (Perkin Elmer, Cambridge, UK.)

Xenografts in Mice. 
 For xenografts, 4 × 106 A375pLKO or A375 
S2-C14 cells in 0.1 mL phosphate-buffered saline were inoculated 
subcutaneously  into  one  flank  each  of  female  CD1  nude  mice 
(Charles  River,  Margate,  Kent,  UK).  When  mice  had  developed 
melanoma nodules of approximately 100 mm3, mice were randomly 
assigned to five per group, and drug administration was initiated (day 
0). Treatment was by oral gavage once daily with vehicle (5% DMSO, 
95% water), or 3 mg or 10 mg/kg body weight selumetinib in vehicle. 
Tumor size was determined at days 7, 12, 19, 26, and 29 by calliper 
measurements of tumor length, width, and depth, and volume was 
calculated as volume = 0.5236 × length × width × depth (mm).

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were performed a minimum of three times. Data 
represent the results for assays performed in triplicate or more, and 
error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistics 
were based on continuous variables. Comparisons between more 
than two treatment groups were made using predominately one-
way analysis of variance with Tukeys’s, Dunnett’s or Bonferroni’s 
post hoc test for multiple comparisons. For comparisons between 
two groups, the Student’s t test was applied. Drug dose–response 
curves were analyzed with a nonlinear regression curve fit model. 
A ranking linear regression fit with Wald–Wolfowitz runs test was 
used  to  compare  SMURF2  and  PAX3  expression  from  cDNA 
array  data.  P  values  of  less  than.05  were  considered  statistically 
significant. All statistical tests were two-sided. All statistical analysis 
and  calculations  were  performed  using  GraphPad  Prism  version 
4.00 for Mac OS (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA).

MITF Expression and Resistance to MEK Inhibitor–
Induced Apoptosis in Melanoma Cells
To  identify  melanoma  specific  proteins  allowing  survival  in  the 
presence of MEK inhibitor, we exposed BRAF-mutant A375 mela-
noma cells to cytotoxic concentrations of PD184352 for 4 days and 
isolated  individual  clones  that  were  able  to  grow  in  the  presence 
of drug (Figure 1, A). Immunoblot analysis of individual clones for 
expression  of  the  central  regulator  of  melanoma  cell  fate,  MITF 
(21–24), identified increased expression compared with the parental 
cell line A375 (Figure 1, B). Further analysis confirmed that in con-
trast with parental A375 cells, A375-R1 and A375-R4 cells were able 
to survive in the presence of MEK inhibitor, which was indicated 
by the absence of an increased subG1 fraction after MEK inhibi-
tor exposure (Figure 1, C). However, the two resistant clones still 
responded to the MEK inhibitor with reduced ERK phosphoryla-
tion (Figure 1, D) and reduced progression into S-phase when com-
pared with the parental cells (cells in S-phase: R1: 25.6% vs 7.12%, 
difference = 18.48%, 95% CI = 13.53 to 23.42, P = .002; R4: 27.87%

(Figure 1, E). As a consequence, when cultured in the presence of 
drug, the resistant cells displayed slow but continuous growth, as 
was seen in a long-term growth experiment. When, after 12 days 
of treatment, the number of cells in a culture dish was assessed by 
staining with crystal violet, the staining intensity of plates contain-
ing  A375-R1  or  A375-R4  cells  was  considerably  higher  than  in 
plates containing A375 cells. The difference in cell number was also 
visible when cells were photographed (Figure 1, F).

MITF depletion from the resistant A375-R1 and A375-R4 cells by 
RNA interference (RNAi) sensitized the cells to PD184352-induced 
caspase 3 cleavage (Figure 2, A). Furthermore, ectopic overexpression 
of MITF in three different sensitive cell lines increased the number 
of colonies growing after 3 weeks in the presence of MEK inhibitor 
when  compared  with  cell  lines  that  had  been  transfected  with 
an  empty  vector  (OD  555  of  stained  cells: A375:  0.046  vs  0.300,

CI = −0.15 to −0.10, P < .001) (Figure 2, B). These initial findings 
indicated  that  MITF  both  is  required  and  sufficient  to  produce 
resistance to MEK inhibitor–induced cell death.

Effect of SMURF2 on MITF Expression and MEK Inhibitor 
Resistance
To identify the mechanism leading to increased MITF expression in 
the acquired resistant A375-R1 and R4 cells, we analyzed the cells for 
the expression of the MITF upstream regulators BRN2 and MITF 
and detected increased expression of only PAX3 (Figure 3, A). PAX3 
is a positive transcriptional regulator of MITF (25) and its RNAi-
mediated depletion in A375 and WM266-4 melanoma cells resulted 
in reduced MITF levels (Supplementary Figure 1, A, available online).

PAX3  and  MITF  regulation  have  been  placed  downstream  of 
TGF-β  in  melanocytes,  where  a  SMAD4/SMAD2-containing 
complex  directly  suppresses  PAX3  expression  (26). We  found  this 
described  mechanism  was  conserved  in  melanoma  cells,  where 
treatment  of  the  melanoma  cells  with  TGF-β  suppressed  PAX3

95%  CI  =  0.36  to  1.07,  P  <  .001;  relative  MITF  expression  in 
untreated cells = 1 vs 0.64 in TGF-β-treated cells, difference = 0.36, 
95% CI = 0.05 to 0.72, P = 0.02) (Figure 3, B). Treatment of A375-R1 
and R4 cells with TGF-β and PD184352 induced caspase 3 cleav-
age (Figure 3, C). Moreover, the treatment of melanoma cells with 
TGF-β and PD184352 reduced cell survival in the acquired resistant 
melanoma cells, with approximately 80% reduction in cell numbers 
(R1: 78.5%, 95% CI = 75.74% to 83.16%, P < .001; R4: 81.5%, 95% 
CI = 79.75% to 83.07%, P < .001) (Figure 3, D).

Because  activating  TGF-β  signalling  suppressed  MITF 
expression and sensitized melanoma cells to MEK inhibitor–induced 

cell  death,  we  hypothesized  that  counteracting TGF-β  signalling 
could  provide  a  mechanism  for  MITF-mediated  MEK  inhibitor 
resistance.  Indeed,  we  detected  statistically  significantly  (R1:  P 
<  .001;  R4:  P  <  .001)  increased  RNA  expression  of  SMURF2 
(Figure 3, E), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the degradation 
and  activity  of  SMAD  proteins  (27,28)  in  the  MEK  inhibitor–
resistant cell lines compared with the parental A375 cells. We found 
that SMURF2 suppresses the amount of SMAD2 in melanoma cells 
(Figure 3, E; Supplementary Figure 2, A, available online), and that 
high SMURF2 levels paralleled high PAX3 expression in A375-R1 
and  A375-R4  cells  (Figure  3,  F).  This  high  PAX3  expression  is 
dependent  on  SMURF2  because  SMURF2  depletion  using  four 
individual siRNAs completely abolished increased PAX3 expression 
(Figure  3,  F).  Accordingly,  MITF  expression  was  also  severely 
reduced (Supplementary Figure 2, C and D, available online).

Depletion  of  SMURF2  from  A375-R1  or  A375-R4  cells  did 
not impact their viability, but additional treatment with PD184352 
induced  cell  death  (Supplementary  Figure,  2,  B  and  E,  available 
online).  A  dose–response  analysis  showed  that  SMURF2  deple-
tion via RNAi overcomes MEK inhibitor resistance, and the GI50 
(concentration of MEK inhibitor required to reduce the cell num-
ber  by  50%  compared  with  DMSO  control)  for  PD184352  in 
A375-R1 and A375-R4 cells was reduced 3- to 10-fold compared

SMURF2-specific shRNA in A375 cells (Supplementary Figure 3,

inhibitor resistance, and the number of PD184352-resistant colo-

PD184352  with  MEK  inhibition  even  at  low  doses  of  inhibitor 
(0.2 µM), detectable by reduced ERK phosphorylation (Figure 4, 
A).  However,  whereas  PD184352  induced  a  cytostatic  effect  in 
high-MITF-expressing cells, it produced cell death in low-MITF-
expressing cell lines (WM266-4, A375, SKMel-2), which was seen 
in  an  increased  subG1  fraction  and  decreased  cell  numbers  in 
SKMel-2, A375 and WM266-4 cells (Figure 4, A–C).

As  seen  with  the  acquired  resistant  cells,  depletion  of  MITF 
from high-MITF- expressing primary resistant cell lines (888mel 
and 501mel cells) resulted in sensitization to PD184352, which led 
to the activation of an apoptotic program through caspase 3 cleav-
age (Figure 4, D) and reduced cell numbers at low concentrations 
of drug (Figure 4, E).

SMURF2 Depletion and MEK Inhibitor–Induced 
Cytotoxicity
When  we  analyzed  primary  MEK  inhibitor–resistant  melanoma 
cells  for  PAX3,  we  found  increased  expression  in  the  resistant 
cell lines, which paralleled increased MITF expression (Figure 5, 
A).  Furthermore,  in  line  with  PAX3  acting  upstream  of  MITF, 
PAX3  depletion  from  A375  cells  enhanced  the  proapoptotic 
effect  of  PD184352  detectable  by  increased  caspase  3  cleavage 
(Supplementary Figure 1, B, available online). In addition, PAX3 
depletion further reduced the number of living cells in the presence 
of PD184352 (A375 control siRNA transfected, PD184352 treated 
vs A375 PAX3 siRNA transfected, PD184352 treated: 75.12% vs 
44.93%, difference = 30.19%, 95% CI = 27.50% to 41.80%, P < 
.001)  (Figure  5,  B).  However,  ectopic  expression  of  MITF  res-
cued A375 cells in which PAX3 was targeted by RNAi and MEK 
by PD184352 (A375 PAX3 siRNA transfected, PD184352 treated 
vs MITF-A375 PAX3 siRNA transfected and PD184352 treated: 
44.93%  vs  85.07%,  difference  =  40.15%,  95%  CI  =  45.69%  to 
34.60%, P < .001) (Figure 5, B). On the other hand, when MITF 
was depleted by RNAi in ectopic MITF-expressing A375 cells, they 
became responsive to PD184352, and the cell number was reduced 
(Figure 5, B).

TGF-β induced caspase 3 cleavage in response to the presence 
of  PD184352  (Figure  5,  C).  Importantly,  this  caspase  3  cleavage 
in response to TGF-β was seen not only in MEK inhibitor–sensi-
tive WM266-4 cells but also in MEK inhibitor–resistant 501mel 
cells (Figure 5, C). The action of TGF-β and PD184352 was also 
reflected in effects on cell survival, most notably in MEK inhibi-
tor–resistant melanoma cells (Figure 5, D).

When we analyzed our panel of melanoma cells, we found sta-
tistically significantly (P = .001) increased SMURF2 expression in 
the primary MEK inhibitor–resistant cell lines compared with the 
MEK inhibitor–sensitive cell lines. (Figure 5, E). When SMURF2 
was  depleted  by  RNAi  in  melanoma  cell  lines,  this  resulted  in 
reduced  PAX3  and  MITF  expression  (Supplementary  Figures  2 
and  3,  available  online),  and  because  reduced  PAX3  and  MITF 
expression sensitizes melanoma cells to MEK inhibition (Figure 1, 
Figure 2, A, Figure 5, B), SMURF2 depletion strongly increased 
cell  death  in  melanoma  cells  in  the  presence  of  PD184352 
(A375,scrambled  control  siRNA  transfected,  PD184352  treated 
vs  A375,  S2  siRNA  transfected  PD184352  treated:  79.58%  vs 
13.47%, difference = 66.11%, 95% CI = 57.27% to 74.94%, P < 
.001) (Figure 5, F). However, ectopic expression of MITF, which 

is  not  affected  by  SMURF2  depletion  (Supplementary  Figure  1, 
C,  available  online),  rescued  the  MEK  inhibitor  effect  on  the 
cell  number  (A375,  S2  siRNA  transfected  PD184352  treated  vs 
MITF-A375, S2 siRNA transfected PD184352 treated: 13.47% vs 
81.18%, difference = 67.71%, 95% CI = 73.95% to 61.47%, P < 
.001) (Figure 5, F). This suggests that reduced MITF expression 
is responsible for the cell death induced by SMURF2 depletion in 
PD184352-treated cells.

SMURF2 Expression in Melanoma and Effect of Its 
Depletion in Melanoma Cells
In our panel of melanoma cell lines, SMURF2 depletion had no 
major  effect  on  cell  viability  (Figure  6,  A).  However,  compared 
with single treatments, combined targeting of SMURF2 and MEK 
produced statistically significant (P < .001) cell death, most nota-
bly in the primary resistant cell lines (Figure 6, A). On the other 
hand, SMURF2 depletion had no noticeable effect on melanocytes 
(Figure  6,  B).  We  also  did  not  observe  any  major  effect  on  cell 
survival when SMURF2 was depleted and MEK inhibited in non-
MITF-expressing but BRAF-mutant colon cancer cells (Figure 6, 
C),  supporting  a  melanoma-specific  role  for  SMURF2.  When 
melanoma cells were grown as spheres in three-dimensional colla-
gen, SMURF2 depletion enhanced PD184352-induced cell death, 
visible  by  ethidium  bromide  uptake  (Figure  6,  D).  Furthermore, 
targeting SMURF2 in fibroblasts did not stimulate tumor-promot-
ing effects otherwise produced by TGF-β (30), such as increased 
expression of VEGF and SPARC (Figure 6, E), which reveals an 
important  difference  between  SMURF2  function  and  TGF-β 
stimulated signalling.

In  advanced  stage  III  and  IV  melanomas,  SMURF2  RNA 
expression was statistically significantly increased compared with 
normal skin (mean of different skin samples and primary skin cells 
[normal melanocytes = 1] 1.05-fold vs stage III 15.40-fold, differ-
ence = 14.35, 95% CI = 21.91-fold to 6.80-fold, P < .001; normal 
1.05-fold vs stage IV 8.01-fold, difference = 6.96, 95% CI = 10.69-
fold to 3.25-fold, P < .001) (Figure 6, F). There was a correlation 
(r2 = 0.788) between SMURF2 and PAX3 expression (Figure 6, G), 
suggesting that the regulatory link between these two proteins is 
preserved in the tumors.

Effect of SMURF2 Depletion on MEK Inhibition In Vivo
In  an  approach  that  allows  rapid  assessment  of  cytotoxic  effects 
in  an  in  vivo  setting,  MEK  inhibitor–resistant  501mel  or  MEK 
inhibitor–sensitive  A375  cells  were 
into  zebrafish 
embryos (Figure 7, A; Supplementary Figure 4, available online). 
Both,  pLKO-control  and  SMURF2-depleted  cells  (ie,  cells  sta-
bly  expressing  SMURF2-specific  shRNAs;  see  also  Figure  3,  H) 
grew with no statistically significant difference (P > .05) in size over 
3 days (Figure 7, A; Supplementary Figure 4, B, available online). 
Xenografts formed by sensitive A375 cells showed no statistically 
significant tumor growth over a period of 3 days (day 1 to day 4) at 
20nM PD184352 (P > .05) (Supplementary Figure 4, B, available 
online).  Resistant  501mel  xenografts  grew  even  in  the  presence 
of 100 nM drug (Figure 7, A), but additional SMURF2 depletion 
reduced  the  xenograft  volume  to  less  than  0.5-fold  of  the  initial 
size measured at day 1 (DMSO: pLKO 3.26-fold vs shSMURF2 
2.78-fold  size  increase  compared  with  day  1,  difference  =  −0.48,

A similar effect was observed for A375 xenografts (Supplementary

SMURF2 depletion led to an approximately 100-fold enhanced 
sensitivity  of  melanoma  cells  to  selumetinib,  a  MEK  inhibitor 
that produces limited responses in melanoma patients (3) (A375:

growth  at  doses  of  25  to  30 mg/kg  twice  daily  (9,31).  However 
pharmacokinetic  analyses  revealed  that  a  dose  of  10 mg/kg  once 
per day produces drug exposures in mice similar to those achieved 
in  clinical  use  (32).  Therefore,  we  used  doses  of  3  and  10 mg/
kg once daily, which did not have a statistically significant effect 
(P > .05) on the growth of parental A375-pLKO tumors (Figure 7,

tributes  to  the  regulation  of  cell  cycle  progression  and  is  required  to 
suppress  apoptosis.  SMURF2  depletion  on  its  own  reduced  cell  cycle 
progression,  which  is  entirely  in  line  with  decreased  MITF  expression 
(37). Under these conditions, MITF levels appear to be sufficient to pro-
vide survival signals as long as MEK is fully active.

C  and  E).  However,  growth  of  tumors  derived  from  SMURF2-
depleted A375 cells was greatly reduced at both dosing regimens, 
with 10 mg/kg selumetinib almost completely suppressing tumor 
growth and 3 mg/kg resulting in approximately 77% reduction in 
tumor size compared with tumors in control mice treated with the 
vehicle  DMSO  (shSMURF2/3mg/kg:  difference  =  77.15%,  95%

ence = 97.9%, 95% CI = 38.65% to 155.50%, P = .005) (Figure 7,

Discussion
The  efficacy  of  most  anticancer  drugs  is  closely  linked  to  their 
cytotoxic potential. Cytostatic drugs can only stop tumor growth, 
which  increases  the  risk  for  the  development  of  acquired  resist-
ance because it allows for the survival and selection of cells that 
are  able  to  continue  to  proliferate  in  the  presence  of  the  drug. 
Therefore,  enhancing  the  cytotoxic  potential  of  a  drug  will  not 
only improve the tumor response, but it will also reduce the emer-
gence of acquired resistance. We found that increased expression of 
MITF, PAX3, and SMURF2 allows melanoma cells to escape the 
proapoptotic effects of MEK inhibition. We identified SMURF2 as 
a regulator of PAX3 expression and, consequently, MITF expres-
sion and demonstrate that exploiting this mechanism dramatically 
enhances the cytotoxic potential of the MEK inhibitors PD184352 
(CI-1040) and selumetinib (AZD6244) in vitro and in vivo.

In  principle,  MEK  inhibitors  can  exert  cytotoxic  effects  by 
directly  activating  the  apoptotic  programme  (6–8,33).  However, 
for  this  to  occur,  high  drug  concentrations  and  long-term  drug 
exposure are required, suggesting that MEK’s contribution to the 
regulation of apoptosis is not major. Rather, it appears that the pre-
dominant  function  of  MEK  is  to  regulate  cell  cycle  progression 
through ERK, which is in agreement with observations that loss 
of  ERK  phosphorylation  leads  to  a  G1  arrest,  but  not  always  to 
the induction of apoptosis (7,10). In line with these findings, we 
identified  cells  that  responded  to  the  MEK  inhibitor  PD184352 
with target inhibition and reduced proliferation but were still able 
to propagate in the long term, a situation likely to be found in a 
tumor. We found that these cells are resistant to the proapoptotic 
effects of MEK inhibition and that, although ERK activity is very 
low, it is still sufficient to promote cell cycle progression. This find-
ing is of great relevance because it highlights the challenge of tar-
geting the MAP-kinase pathway as a single-agent treatment. It is, 
therefore, of great importance to identify factors that will predict 
and moreover enhance the sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.

We  identified  the  melanocyte-specific  transcription  factor 
MITF as a predictive marker for the sensitivity of melanoma cells 
toward the cytotoxic effect of MEK inhibitors. We found that high 
MITF expression protects cells from MEK inhibitor–induced cell 
death, which is striking considering that MITF is amplified in up to 
20% of melanomas (34). MITF is a central regulator of melanoma 
cell fate because it controls differentiation, proliferation, and inva-
sion (21,22,24). Although we do not know the exact mechanism as 
to how MITF regulates survival in cells in which MEK is inhibited, 
MITF is a known regulator of melanoma cell survival, where it can 
induce the expression of BCL-2 or ML-inhibitor of apoptosis and 
protect cells from cytotoxic agents (34–36).

We have shown previously that MITF contributes to cell cycle 
progression downstream of BRAF (37), but now we show that it 
also cooperates with MEK to provide survival signals (Figure 7, F). 
Although MEK can activate survival signals through ERK (7,8), 
it is the cooperation of both MEK and MITF that is required for 
survival. In this context, we identified SMURF2 as a regulator of 
MITF expression through PAX3 (Figure 7, F). SMURF2 depletion 
alone reduced cell cycle progression (Supplementary Figure 2, B, 
available online), which is entirely in line with decreased MITF 
expression. However MITF levels appear to be still sufficient to 
provide  survival  signals  as  long  as  MEK  is  fully  active  because 
we observed no effects on cell viability with SMURF2 depletion 
alone. Thus, SMURF2 itself seems to be only relevant for mela-
noma  cells  when  MEK  is  inhibited.  Importantly,  we  also  found 
that  depleting  SMURF2  from  melanocytes  did  not  have  any 
effect on their growth and survival. This suggests that targeting 
SMURF2 in normal cells does not affect viability or growth prob-
ably  because  of  compensatory  mechanisms,  an  assumption  that 
is further supported by the fact that SMURF2-/- mice are viable 
and  develop  healthy  and  normal  to  adulthood  (28). These  mice 
eventually develop tumors; however, this occurs with a very long 
latency  at  an  age  of  more  than  20  months  (38,39),  suggesting 
that loss of SMURF2 function does not produce any immediate 
adverse effects.

SMURF2 is a HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, which reg-
ulates  the  turnover  of  inhibitory  SMADs  and  associated TGF-β 
receptors as well as regulatory SMADs (27). SMURF2 also regu-
lates cell polarity, motility, and senescence in a SMAD- independ-
ent manner (40–43). These findings suggest that SMURF2 plays an 
important role in various aspects relevant for tumor initiation and 
progression in a SMAD-dependent as well as SMAD-independent 
manner. We found that SMURF2 regulates SMAD2 levels in mela-
noma cells (Figure 3, E; Supplementary Figure 2, available online). 
However, although SMAD2 has been shown to regulate the sup-
pression of PAX3 in melanocytes (26), the complete mechanism as 
to how SMURF2 suppresses PAX3 is not clear and might involve 
additional factors other than SMAD2. We and others detected high 
expression  levels  of  SMURF2  in  tumors  compared  with  normal 
tissue (42,44), suggesting a deregulation of this ubiquitin ligase in 
cancer. On the other hand, the neutralization of SMURF2 activity 
by the ubiquitin-specific peptidase USP15 is important for TGF-
β-mediated glioblastoma progression (45), suggesting tumor-spe-
cific differences in SMURF2 function. A tumor-specific function 
is supported by our finding that SMURF2 depletion from colon 
cancer cells did not prime these cells for MEK inhibitor cytotoxic-
ity despite a mutant BRAF status.

We have identified SMURF2 as a potential therapeutic target in 
melanoma. However, there are clear limitations to our study. First 
we used xenograft assays to assess combined therapy in vivo, and 
this approach does not consider the heterogeneity found in a real 
tumor situation. Second, no SMURF2 inhibitor is available, and we 
had to rely on knock-down experiments in our study, which might 
produce  different  effects  than  inhibition  of  SMURF2  activity. 
Finally, we have no clinical data showing that increased expression 
of SMURF2 or MITF correlates with MEK inhibitor resistance, 
but we hope to be able to collect such samples in the future and 
analyze them for these potential resistance regulators.

Recent  experiences  with  targeting  kinases  in  patients  have 
exposed the inevitable risk of developing resistance because of com-
plex kinase networks and feedback mechanisms (10,13–16,46,47). 
Therefore, targeting a nonkinase might provide an advantage. E3 
ubiquitin ligases gained a lot of attention as potential drug targets 
when the MDM2/p53 inhibitors Nutlin1–3 were discovered, but 
initial efforts to identify other E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibitors proved 
difficult (48). On the other hand, recent successes with inhibitors 
of  apoptosis  are  encouraging  (48),  suggesting  that  developing  a 
SMURF2-specific  inhibitor  might  be  possible. Alternatively,  fur-
ther characterization of the SMURF2, PAX3, and MITF regula-
tion in melanoma may lead to the identification of better druggable 
proteins that can be targeted in MEK inhibitor combination thera-
pies. Our results strongly suggest that in melanoma such therapies 
might  have  the  potential  to  increase  the  frequency  of  complete 
responses  and  reduce  the  risk  of  the  development  of  acquired 
resistance.
