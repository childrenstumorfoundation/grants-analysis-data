Background: Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that disrupts central nervous system devel-
opment and neuronal function. Cognitively, NF1 is characterized by diﬃculties with executive control and vi-
suospatial abilities. Little is known about the neural substrates underlying these deﬁcits. The current study
utilized Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) to explore the neural correlates of spatial
working memory (WM) deﬁcits in patients with NF1.
Methods: BOLD images were acquired from 23 adults with NF1 (age M = 32.69; 61% male) and 25 matched
healthy controls (age M = 33.08; 64% male) during an in-scanner visuo-spatial WM task. Whole brain functional
and psycho-physiological interaction analyses were utilized to investigate neural activity and functional con-
nectivity, respectively, during visuo-spatial WM performance. Participants also completed behavioral measures
of spatial reasoning and verbal WM.
Results: Relative to healthy controls, participants with NF1 showed reduced recruitment of key components of
WM circuitry, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right parietal cortex. In addition, healthy controls
exhibited greater simultaneous deactivation between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and temporal regions
than NF1 patients. In contrast, NF1 patients showed greater PCC and bilateral parietal connectivity with visual
cortices as well as between the PCC and the cerebellum. In NF1 participants, increased functional coupling of the
PCC with frontal and parietal regions was associated with better spatial reasoning and WM performance, re-
spectively; these relationships were not observed in controls.
Conclusions: Dysfunctional engagement of WM circuitry, and aberrant functional connectivity of ‘task-negative’
regions in NF1 patients may underlie spatial WM diﬃculties characteristic of the disorder.

1. Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant
neurogenetic disorder, occurring in approximately 1 in every 3000
births, that results from mutation(s) in a single gene located on
Chromosome 17q11 (Fain et al., 1987; Cawthon et al., 1990; Viskochil
et al., 1990; Wallace et al., 1990). The NF1 gene encodes the neuroﬁ-
bromin (NF1) protein, which plays an essential role in central nervous

system (CNS) development and neural diﬀerentiation via the p21 Ras
GTP-ase (Ras) signaling pathway (North, 2000). Neuroﬁbromin is also
known to play a role in adult function in the CNS, including the control
of GABA-mediated inhibition (Costa et al., 2002). Mutation of the NF1
gene results in increased Ras signaling, which is hypothesized to lead to
the characteristic abnormalities in brain morphology in NF1 patients
and to increased neuronal inhibition in adults with NF1 (Costa et al.,
2002; Mainberger et al., 2013; Shilyansky et al., 2010). Notably, brain

morphology changes include macrocephaly, increased gray and white
matter volume, widespread alterations in white matter integrity
(Karlsgodt et al., 2012), white matter hyperintensities, and increased
volume of the corpus collosum (Payne et al., 2010). In addition to
structural brain abnormalities, increased Ras signaling is associated
with speciﬁc cognitive deﬁcits in studies of NF1 mouse models
(Shilyansky et al., 2010). As a single gene mutation that disrupts
learning and memory, NF1 presents a valuable model for understanding
mechanisms underlying cognitive disability.

Individuals with NF1 exhibit visuospatial diﬃculties, executive
function deﬁcits (Hyman et al., 2005; Rowbotham et al., 2009; Roy
et al., 2010; Payne et al., 2011), and speciﬁc learning disabilities
(Hyman et al., 2006), as well as increased rates of autism spectrum
disorders (ASD; Garg et al., 2013). The extent to which documented
brain structural abnormalities relate to the NF1 behavioral proﬁle is not
yet well understood. However, there is some evidence to suggest that
the magnitude of neuroanatomic alteration is associated with the se-
verity of cognitive impairment in NF1 patients, as reviewed by Payne
et al. (2010). For instance, Moore et al. (2000) found that increased
volume of the corpus collosum in NF1 patients was associated with
poorer visuospatial performance and academic achievement.

Although few functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
have been conducted to date in NF1 patients, existing studies oﬀer
evidence for disrupted neural activity during visuospatial task perfor-
mance (Payne et al., 2010). Using a mental rotation task, Billingsley
et al. (2004) found that, relative to matched typically developing con-
trols, children with NF1 engaged posterior brain regions, whereas
controls tended to engage frontal regions. An altered pattern of hemi-
spheric specialization has also been observed in NF1 patients relative to
controls during performance on a line orientation judgment task
(Clements-Stephens et al., 2008), involving signiﬁcantly greater left
hemisphere than right hemisphere activation across both frontal and
posterior regions. More recently, Violante et al. (2012) found evidence
for a link between visual processing and aberrant in-task default mode
network (DMN) recruitment. Speciﬁcally, they found that, relative to
healthy controls, patients with NF1 (both children and adults) exhibited
deﬁcient activation of low-level visual cortex in response to visual sti-
muli, and that altered activation of the magnocellular pathway was
associated with increased activation in midline DMN regions. Violate
et al. hypothesized that the increased activation of DMN regions during
task performance suggests a failure to appropriately deactivate the
DMN, possibly leading to ‘default mode interference’ during visual
processing.

In addition, our research group observed diﬀerential recruitment of
working memory circuitry during performance on a task of spatial
working memory capacity (SCAP) in an independent sample of NF1
patients relative to healthy controls. The SCAP task requires individuals
to keep locations of spatially dispersed stimuli in mind for a brief period
of time and has been shown to robustly activate neural circuitry in-
volved in spatial working memory (Glahn et al., 2002). Speciﬁcally, we
found that adult NF1 patients exhibited right lateralized hypoactivation
within the frontal eyeﬁelds and right parietal cortex relative to controls
during task trials. In addition, NF1 patients exhibited less deactivation
of default mode regions (i.e., medial prefrontal cortex) than healthy
controls (Shilyansky et al., 2010), providing some support for the hy-
pothesis of ‘default mode interference’ in NF1 suggested by Violante
et al. (2012); however, the general nature of the relationship between
“task positive” and “task negative” networks is still unclear. Activation
within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) predicted task per-
formance accuracy in the NF1 patients, such that as neural activity
increased within this region, performance accuracy increased, a result
consistent with the hypothesis that increased neuronal inhibition may
contribute to cognitive deﬁcits in NF1 (Costa et al., 2002; Mainberger
et al., 2013; Shilyansky et al., 2010).

To our knowledge there have been no investigations of task-based
functional connectivity in the NF1 population. Here we investigated the

neural underpinnings of spatial working memory deﬁcits in NF1 by
probing two complementary aspects of task-dependent blood oxyge-
nation level dependent (BOLD) activity – magnitude changes and
functional connectivity (using psychophysiological interaction analysis;
PPI). We compared these measures of neural function in NF1 patients
relative to healthy controls during performance on a parametrically
varying spatial working memory capacity task (SCAP; 18). Based upon
previous work (Shilyansky et al., 2010), we predicted that during
spatial working memory task performance NF1 patients would exhibit
relative hypoactivation within working memory-relevant neural cir-
cuitry (i.e. DLPFC and parietal regions). Given pre-clinical ﬁndings
suggesting NF1 is associated with increased inhibitory activity within
fronto-striatal networks (Shilyansky et al., 2010), we hypothesized that
NF1 patients would show reduced task-related functional connectivity
within working memory-related neural circuitry compared to healthy
controls. In addition, we expected reduced connectivity within DMN-
related regions during task performance in healthy individuals, but
greater connectivity in NF1 patients, suggesting increased default mode
interference.

2. Methods and materials

2.1. Participants

A total of 48 participants were included in the current study (23 NF1
patients and 25 demographically comparable healthy controls).
Participants ranged in age from 18 to 47 years. NF1 participants were
screened and enrolled by a pediatric neurologist (T.R.), a clinician with
experience caring for individuals with NF. All subjects included were
participants in a clinical trial, as described in Bearden et al. (2016);
however, all testing was conducted prior to treatment randomization.
Two NF1 patients included were conﬁrmed to have asymptomatic optic
gliomas at the time of testing.

NF1 patient inclusion criteria were: 1) Meets NIH NF1 diagnostic
criteria (Stumf, 1988) and does not have segmental NF1. 2) No evi-
dence of intracranial pathology such as hydrocephalus or brain tumor,
other than an asymptomatic optic pathway or other NF1-related
glioma; 3) Full-Scale IQ ≥ 70 (as determined by the Wechsler Abbre-
viated Scale of Intelligence [WASI]; Wechsler, 2011); 4) No comorbid
major neurological or psychiatric disorder (e.g., epilepsy, bipolar dis-
order, psychotic illness, major depression); 5) No MRI contra-
indications; female participants could not be pregnant or lactating; 6)
Suﬃcient ﬂuency in English. Healthy controls also had to meet inclu-
sion criteria 2 through 6 above.

Participants were recruited from three primary sources: 1) The
Children's Hospital Los Angeles Neuroﬁbromatosis Clinic, a major NF1
referral center for the greater Los Angeles region; 2) local Children's
Tumor Foundation and NF Network family educational symposia; 3)
NF-related websites as well as www.clinicaltrials.gov. Demographically
comparable healthy controls were recruited from the Consortium for
Neuropsychiatric Phenomics, a study ongoing concurrently at UCLA
(Poldrack et al., 2016a), and for which the neuroimaging data are now
freely available at OpenfMRI (https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000030/
).

2.2. Procedure

All aspects of the research project were granted IRB approval by
UCLA, prior to the collection of any data. All participants provided
verbal and written informed consent before participation in any aspect
of the study, after study procedures were fully explained.

2.3. Measures

2.3.1. Neuropsychological measures

Cognitive functioning was assessed via a neuropsychological battery

802

administered by supervised clinical psychology doctoral students or
Master's level psychometricians. IQ data were obtained using either the
Matrix Reasoning and Vocabulary subtests from the WASI (Wechsler,
2011) for the NF1 patients and the same measures from the Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale, Version 4 (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2014) for the
healthy controls (scaled scores were used to account for diﬀerences
between task versions). Matrix Reasoning was also examined as a
measure of nonverbal reasoning ability.

Working memory capacity was measured behaviorally using the
University of Maryland Letter–Number Sequencing (LNS) task (Gold
et al., 1997). In this task, participants are presented with sets of num-
bers and letters of varying length and then must repeat back the pre-
sented numbers in ascending order and letters in alphabetical order.

2.3.2. Spatial capacity working memory (SCAP) task

Participants viewed a visual array presenting 1, 3, 5, or 7 circles on
the screen followed by a probe circle. The participant had to indicate
whether the probe circle was presented in the same position as one of
the circles in the previous array, as described in detail in Montojo et al.
(2014) and Glahn et al. (2002). Trial events included a two second
target-array presentation, a 1.5, 3 or 4.5 s delay period, and a three
second response period. Half the task trials were true-positive, and half
were true-negative. Task trials were compared to the ﬁxation during the
inter-trial interval. Participants underwent a brief behavioral training
session on the task prior to administration in the scanner, as described
below.

2.3.3. fMRI acquisition

All data were collected at the University of California, Los Angeles
in one of two scanning facilities both with 3 T Siemens Tim Trio MRI
scanner, running Siemens versions syngo MR B15 and B17. 219. Group
level whole brain and PPI analyses included scanner as a covariate.
Functional T2- weighted echo planar images (EPIs) were collected with
the following parameters: slice thickness = 4 mm, 34 slices, TR = 2 s,
TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angles = 90°, matrix 192 × 192, FOV = 192 mm.
Additionally, a T2-weighted matched-bandwidth high resolution ana-
tomical scan (same slice prescription as EPI) and MPRAGE were col-
lected. The parameters for the MPRAGE were the following: TR = 2.3 s,
TE = 2.91 ms, FOV = 256 mm, matrix = 240 × 256, ﬂip angle = 9°,
slice thickness = 1.20 mm, 160 slices.

2.3.4. Statistical analyses

Analyses of neuropsychological and clinical data were performed
using SPSS software v. 21 (IBM). We compared demographic char-
acteristics between groups using independent samples t-tests for con-
tinuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.

FMRI data analyses were performed using the FMRIB software li-
brary (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl), version 5.0 (Smith et al., 2004).
Images for each participant were realigned to compensate for small
head movements (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001). Subjects with average
translational motion > 3 mm were excluded (n = 1). Data were spa-
tially smoothed using a 5-mm,
full-width-half-maximum Gaussian
kernel. The data were ﬁltered in the temporal domain using a nonlinear
high-pass ﬁlter with a 66 s cutoﬀ. A three-step registration process was
used in which EPI images were ﬁrst registered to the matched-band-
width high-resolution scan, then to the MPRAGE structural image, and
ﬁnally into standard (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI]) space,
using nonlinear transformations. Four NF1 patients were registered
using linear transformations due to image distortion during registration
with nonlinear transformation.

Standard model ﬁtting was conducted for all subjects, and all task
trials were included in the analysis. Higher-level analyses modeled all
loads. For ﬁrst-level whole brain analyses, the following events were
modeled after convolution with a canonical gamma hemodynamic re-
sponse function: All loads, load 1, load 3, load 5, load 7, delay 1.5 s
(sec), delay 3 s, and delay 4.5 s. Events were modeled with the onset at

the target presentation and duration of 6.5, 8, and 9.5 s to include the
variable delay and probe periods. The six motion parameters and
temporal derivatives of all regressors were included as covariates of no
interest to improve statistical sensitivity. For each subject, the following
contrasts were computed: All loads, load 1, load 3, load 5, load 7. The
output from the subject-speciﬁc analyses was analyzed using a mixed-
eﬀects model with FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Eﬀects (FLAME).
To ﬁrst rule out potential scanner-related diﬀerences, we checked
for diﬀerences in neural activity between scanners in each group. Seven
healthy controls and nine NF1 patients were scanned at the UCLA
Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, and 18 healthy controls and 14 NF1
patents were scanned at the UCLA Brain Mapping Center, on identically
conﬁgured scanners. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the pro-
portion of NF1 patients and healthy controls scanned at each location
(χ2(2,48) = 0.67, p > 0.05). There were no diﬀerences in activation
between scanners (p > 0.05 for all comparisons); thus, all subsequent
group-level analyses were conducted with age, gender, and scanner
added as covariates.

Using FSL's FLAME, group-level statistics images were thresholded
with a cluster-forming threshold of z > 2.3 as well as 3.1 and a cluster
probability of p < 0.05, corrected for whole-brain multiple compar-
isons using Gaussian random ﬁeld theory. According to Eklund et al.
(2016, pp. 7902), “among the parametric software packages, FSL's
FLAME1 clusterwise inference stood out as having much lower FWE,
often being valid (under 5%), but this comes at the expense of highly
conservative voxelwise inference.” These ﬁndings suggest that FSL's
FLAME1 at a cluster threshold of 2.3 has much lower family wise error
rates than other parametric software packages, almost comparable to
permutation methods. Nevertheless, we still ran the analysis with a
cluster z > 3.1 to see if the results at the z > 2.3 threshold were
maintained.
brain
(139,264 voxels). Brain regions were identiﬁed using the Harvard-Ox-
ford cortical and subcortical probabilistic atlases as well as associated
Brodmann areas for regions without Harvard-Oxford designations. All
activations are reported in MNI coordinates. For reporting of clusters,
we used the cluster command in FSL. Anatomical localization within
each cluster was obtained by searching within maximum likelihood
regions from the FSL Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas to obtain the
maximum z-statistic and MNI coordinates within each anatomical re-
gion contained within a cluster.

Due to a technical issue during scan acquisition, behavioral data
from the SCAP task were only available for a subset of NF1 patients
(n = 5), although behavioral data were successfully collected on all 25
healthy controls. Thus, we modeled all trials in our fMRI analyses. To
conﬁrm that any observed diﬀerences in neural activity were not due to
diﬀerences in task performance, subjects with available SCAP beha-
vioral data were included in a follow-up analysis modeling all trials vs.
correct trials only (see Supplementary Results for details).

2.3.5. PPI analyses

We used the generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI)
method described in McLaren et al. (2012). Prior to running the gPPI
analysis all subjects' SCAP scans were run through the FSL motion
outlier tool (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLMotionOutliers) to
remove timepoints with signiﬁcant motion (FD > 0.5 mm). First, the
following events were modeled after convolution with a canonical
gamma hemodynamic response function: load 1, load 3, load 5, and
load 7. Events were modeled with the onset of the visual array pre-
sentation.

Second, we extracted the time course of a priori seed regions within
the left parietal, right parietal, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).
The parietal regions were selected given their central role in working
memory function (Baddeley, 2003; Todd and Marois, 2004). The PCC
seed was selected as a central hub of the default mode network (DMN;
33,34), as we were interested in exploring potential task related DMN
interference in NF1. Seed regions were 8 mm spheres centered on the

description of the sample and Table 1 for ROI coordinates.

Third, the seed time-course was multiplied by condition onset times
for load 1, load 3, load 5, and load 7 separately, and then convolved
with the hemodynamic response function to obtain the PPI results for
each load. The six motion parameters and temporal derivatives of all
regressors were included as covariates of no interest to improve sta-
tistical sensitivity by reducing the inﬂuence of motion. In order to
simplify the analyses and reduce multiple comparisons, rather than
investigating each load separately, a contrast was set up in order to
calculate the mean PPI for all loads. Similar to the whole brain analysis,
Group-level statistics images were thresholded with a cluster-forming
threshold of z > 2.3 and a Bonferroni corrected cluster probability of
p < 0.017. PPI beta values between seed and secondary regions
(Harvard-Oxford anatomical masks of the frontal, temporal, and par-
ietal regions) were extracted from the all loads zstat image.

2.3.6. PPI and behavioral measures

To assess whether functional connectivity during task performance
was associated with cognitive performance outside the scanner, we
assessed the relationship between seed-based connectivity and beha-
vioral performance on two tasks of nonverbal reasoning and auditory
working memory, respectively, Matrix Reasoning and LNS, using linear
regression models. Each Beta coeﬃcient value represents the mean
connectivity between a seed region (PCC, left parietal, or right parietal)
and a target region of interest (ROI). Target ROIs are structural ROIs
extracted from the Harvard-Oxford atlas (frontal = frontal pole + in-
ferior middle frontal, temporal = middle temporal lobe posterior divi-
sion + inferior temporal posterior division, and parietal = lateral oc-
cipital + superior parietal lobule; see Supplementary Fig. 3 for ROIs).
Betas were extracted using the fslmeants command in fsl from each PPI
group level model (controlling for scanner), which presents the average
intensities over all voxels in the ROI. We then used the betas extracted
from each seed-target pair as predictors in a regression with each of the

behavioral tasks as the outcome variable.

NF1 patients and healthy controls were analyzed separately. We did
not include all the connectivity values in one model because of sig-
niﬁcant collinearity with the overlapping PPI seed regions. Thus, we
ran three separate models run for each behavioral measure as the
outcome; the connectivity values for each target region were included
in the same model. Speciﬁcally, Model I included age, left parietal-
frontal betas (i.e., beta regression coeﬃcient value indexing con-
nectivity between the left parietal seed and the Harvard-Oxford derived
frontal pole region), right parietal-frontal betas, and PCC-frontal betas
as predictors. Model II includes age, left parietal-parietal betas, right
parietal-parietal betas, and PCC-parietal betas as predictors. Lastly,
Model III includes age, left parietal-temporal betas, right parietal-tem-
poral betas, and PCC-temporal betas as predictors.

3.1. Behavioral results

3.1.1. Demographic and clinical characteristics

The total sample consisted of 47 adult participants (23 NF1, 25
healthy controls). As shown in Table 2, NF1 and control groups were
matched on all demographic factors except for IQ and years of educa-
tion, such that controls had signiﬁcantly higher IQ and more years of
education than NF1 patients. Diﬀerences between NF1 patients and
healthy controls on IQ and years of education are consistent with pre-
vious ﬁndings (Levine et al., 2006; Tomson et al., 2015).

3.2. Whole brain activation results

3.2.1. All loads

As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 3, a comparison between controls and
NF1 patients across all working memory loads revealed signiﬁcantly
increased activation in controls relative to NF1 patients in the left
DLFPC and right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) at the cluster threshold of
2.3. The left DLPFC cluster was still signiﬁcant at a cluster threshold of
3.1, although the right IPS cluster was no longer signiﬁcant at this
threshold (see Supplementary Fig. 4 and Table 3). There were no re-
gions showing greater activation for NF1 patients relative to controls, at
either threshold.

3.2.2. High versus low loads

As shown in Fig. 1c and Table 3 (cluster threshold of 2.3), controls
showed greater right lateral occipital activation in high loads than low
loads as compared to NF1 patients. In contrast, relative to controls NF1

patients exhibited more activation in the posterior cingulate, right an-
gular gyrus, right orbitofrontal cortex, right temporal pole, right middle
frontal gyrus, left parietal cortex, and left inferior temporal gyrus in
high loads than low loads. At a cluster threshold of 3.1, healthy controls
did not show any regions of diﬀerentially increased activation relative
to NF1 patients for high versus low loads; however, most of the pre-
viously observed results for NF1 patients relative to controls survived
this more stringent threshold (i.e., greater activation in the posterior
cingulate, left parietal cortex, and right orbitofrontal cortex). Increased

activation in the right middle temporal gyrus was also observed in NF1
patients vs. controls at this threshold (see Supplementary Fig. 5 and
Table 3).

between the left parietal seed and multiple cortical and subcortical
regions (at z = 2.3); speciﬁcally, left secondary visual cortex, left pre-
motor cortex, left associative visual cortex, and cerebellum, relative to
healthy controls. There were no regions for which controls showed
greater left parietal connectivity than NF1 patients (see Table 4 and
Fig. 2a). Percent signal change in the left parietal seed indicates acti-
vation of the region (Fig. 2d). At a cluster threshold of 3.1 there were no
regions of diﬀerential connectivity with the left parietal seed.

When comparing high versus low loads (z = 2.3), NF1 patients
exhibited greater connectivity between the left parietal seed and left
secondary visual cortex. There were no regions in which healthy con-
trols showed greater connectivity with the left parietal seed region than
NF1 patients (see Fig. 3a and Table 4). At z = 3.1, however, neither
NF1 patients or healthy controls exhibited greater connectivity with the
left parietal seed.

3.3.2. Functional connectivity with right parietal seed region

Similarly, in all loads (z = 2.3), NF1 patients showed greater con-
nectivity between the right parietal seed and left associative visual
cortex as well as the primary visual cortex. There were no regions in
which controls showed greater right parietal connectivity than NF1
patients (see Table 4 and Fig. 2b). Percent signal change in the right
parietal seed indicates activation of the region (Fig. 2d). At a cluster

threshold of 3.1, neither NF1 patients or healthy controls showed sig-
niﬁcant connectivity with the right parietal seed (see Supplementary
Fig. 6 and Table 4).

In the high versus low load contrast, NF1 patients did not exhibit
greater connectivity with the right parietal seed than healthy controls.
Healthy controls showed greater connectivity between the right parietal
seed with the right pars opercularis, bilateral parietal cortex, left pre-
motor cortex, and the posterior cingulate (see Fig. 3b and Table 4). At a
cluster threshold of 3.1, healthy controls still showed greater con-
nectivity between the right parietal seed and right pars opercularis
relative to NF1 patients (see Supplementary Fig. 7 and Table 4).

3.3.3. Functional connectivity with posterior cingulate (PCC) seed region

For all loads (z = 2.3), NF1 patients showed greater connectivity
between the PCC and cerebellum, right inferior temporal gyrus, right
precentral gyrus, and left premotor cortex than did healthy controls. In
contrast, we found that healthy controls showed greater connectivity
between the PCC and left superior temporal gyrus, as well as the left
fusiform gyrus, than did NF1 patients (see Table 4 and Fig. 2c). Percent
signal change in the PCC seed indicates deactivation of the region;
hence, connectivity between regions listed above indicates healthy
controls are exhibiting greater simultaneous deactivation in these re-
gions during the task compared to baseline than are NF1 patients

(Fig. 2d). At a cluster threshold of 3.1, NF1 patients still showed greater
connectivity between the PCC and cerebellum than healthy controls,
and healthy controls still showed greater connectivity between the PCC
and left superior temporal gyrus (see Supplementary Fig. 8 and

In the high versus low load contrast, NF1 patients exhibited greater
connectivity between the PCC seed and the left secondary visual cortex
and left inferior temporal gyrus. Healthy controls exhibited greater
connectivity between the PCC seed and the right precentral gyrus, right
and medial premotor cortex (see Fig. 3c and Table 4). No signiﬁcant
connectivity diﬀerences between NF1 patients and healthy controls for
the high vs. low load contrast were observed at a cluster threshold of
3.1.

3.4. Functional connectivity and cognitive abilities

3.4.1. Matrix Reasoning

PCC-frontal connectivity was a signiﬁcant predictor of Matrix
Reasoning performance in NF1 patients, but this relationship was not
observed in healthy controls (see Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 4a).
The relationship was such that greater connectivity between the PCC
and the frontal region was associated with better Matrix Reasoning
performance for NF1 patients (β = 0.57, p < 0.05). This eﬀect sur-
vives Bonferroni correction of p < 0.017. There were no other sig-
niﬁcant predictors of Matrix Reasoning performance.

PCC-parietal connectivity was a signiﬁcant predictor of LNS per-
formance (β = 0.45, p < 0.05) in NF1 patients but not in healthy

controls (see Supplementary Table 2 and Fig. 4b). As PCC-parietal
connectivity increased in NF1 patients, so did LNS performance.
However, this eﬀect does not hold up under Bonferroni correction.
There were no other signiﬁcant predictors of LNS performance.

4. Discussion

Our study both conﬁrmed and extended previous ﬁndings regarding
the neural substrates of spatial working memory in patients with NF1, a
monogenic disorder associated with speciﬁc cognitive impairments.
First, we found signiﬁcant hypoactivation of key components of
working memory circuitry, the right IPS and left DLPFC in patients with
NF1 relative to healthy controls during task performance, thus sup-
porting prior ﬁndings in independent samples (Hyman et al., 2006;
Clements-Stephens et al., 2008), including our own previous work
(Shilyansky et al., 2010). In addition, when investigating regions acti-
vated in high memory loads relative to low loads, controls showed
greater right lateral occipital activation than NF1 patients. In contrast,
NF1 patients exhibited more diﬀuse activation during high loads than
low loads, speciﬁcally in the posterior cingulate, right angular gyrus,
right orbitofrontal cortex, right temporal pole, right middle frontal
gyrus, left parietal cortex, and left inferior temporal gyrus, as compared
to healthy controls. Based on these ﬁndings, it is tempting to speculate
that the more diﬀuse pattern of increased activation in high vs low
memory loads in NF1 patients may reﬂect a less eﬃcient pattern of
neural activity. This hypothesis warrants further investigation in future
studies of both working memory and other cognitive functions aﬀected
in NF1.

Secondly, our ﬁndings revealed novel information regarding func-
tional connectivity during spatial WM task performance in NF1. The PPI
analyses indicated diﬀerential patterns of connectivity between patients
with NF1 and healthy controls. Speciﬁcally, NF1 patients exhibited
greater connectivity than healthy controls between bilateral parietal
(‘task-positive’) regions and visual cortices. In addition, consistent with
the overall pattern of ﬁndings, when comparing high vs. low memory
loads NF1 patients exhibited greater connectivity (relative to healthy
controls) between the left parietal and the left visual cortex. In contrast,
healthy controls showed greater connectivity (compared to NF1) with
the right parietal and frontal, bilateral parietal regions, and the PCC.
Notably, healthy controls exhibited greater connectivity between a
‘task-negative’ region (PCC) and left temporal regions than NF1 pa-
tients. As the PCC showed deactivation during task performance, this
pattern of ﬁndings indicates diﬀerentially greater simultaneous deac-
tivation of the PCC and left temporal regions during working memory
trials in controls relative to patients with NF1. In contrast, NF1 patients
exhibited greater connectivity between the “task-negative” region
(PCC) and regions not generally associated with the DMN or visuo-
spatial WM performance (i.e. cerebellum) than healthy controls.

Previous research has implicated the PCC and lateral temporal
cortex (as well as several other regions) in the DMN (Buckner et al.,
2008). DMN regions are associated with self-referential thought and are
generally known to be less active during demanding cognitive tasks
(Buckner et al., 2008). In addition, diﬀerential activation and deacti-
vation of the DMN has been found in multiple clinical groups (e.g.
patients with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and an-
xiety) as compared to healthy controls (Broyd et al., 2009). Relatively

809

A.F.A. Ibrahim et al.

less deactivation of the DMN during a cognitive task is associated with
lapsed attention (Buckner et al., 2008), and evidence of decreased de-
activation of the DMN has been observed in patients with Alzheimer's,
epilepsy, and autism (Broyd et al., 2009). Reduced functional con-
nectivity between the PCC and temporal regions in individuals with
NF1 relative to controls could indicate DMN interference, as postulated
by Violante et al. (2012). To elaborate, the increased connectivity be-
tween DMN associated regions during task trials in healthy controls
could suggest appropriate deactivation of the DMN during WM per-
formance. In contrast, the reduced connectivity in the DMN associated
regions of NF1 patients could indicate a failure to properly deactivate
the DMN, possibly leading to task interference. However, deﬁnitive
support for the DMN interference hypothesis warrants further experi-
ments capable of dissecting the causal inﬂuence of task-positive net-
works on DMN activation/deactivation. Our study is the ﬁrst to explore
task based functional connectivity in NF1 patients, and thus provides
unique insight into atypical patterns of neural activity that underlie
characteristic cognitive impairments in NF1. It is currently unclear
whether the altered functional connectivity observed in patients with
NF1 is a source of their cognitive dysfunction or a compensatory me-
chanism.

Finally, we found that task-related long-range connectivity between
the PCC and frontal/parietal lobes was associated with better perfor-
mance on behavioral measures of visuospatial and working memory
ability (respectively) in patients with NF1, although this relationship
was not observed in controls. As hypothesized, this ﬁnding suggests that
appropriate deactivation of DMN implicated regions is associated with
better task performance for NF1 patients. Anterior-posterior con-
nectivity could be essential for successful visuo-spatial performance,
speciﬁcally in NF1 patients. Our ﬁnding is the ﬁrst to demonstrate a
possible relationship between functional connectivity and cognitive
ability in NF1 patients.

5. Implications, limitations and future directions

Our ﬁndings expand current understanding of aberrant neural
functioning in NF1 patients. Two major strengths of the current study
were that: 1) we replicated the prior ﬁndings of Shilyansky et al. (2010)
of hypoactivation of working memory circuitry in an independent
sample of patients with NF1; and 2), in a novel analysis, we extended
our previous ﬁndings to explore on-line working memory task related
connectivity in NF1 patients, and the relationship of task-related con-
nectivity to behavioral performance.

Understanding the speciﬁc mechanisms associated with these deﬁ-
cits has the potential to inform future intervention trials. Interventions
targeting impairments in visuospatial learning and attention have not
yielded replicable results in children with NF1 (Bearden et al., 2016;
Payne et al., 2016), despite work in animal models showing that ma-
nipulations which decrease Ras activity can rescue cognitive deﬁcits
(Costa and Silva, 2002). It is important to note that our fMRI study
included adults with NF1, and thus may not generalize to children with
this disorder.

Several other limitations of the current study should be noted. Most
obviously, the sample size was modest; however, given that the pre-
valence of NF1 is about 1:3000 (Fain et al., 1987), larger samples are a
challenge for a single site study. Finally, due to a technical malfunction
behavioral data were unavailable for the majority of NF1 participants
from the in-scanner working memory task. Despite this, we did ﬁnd that
functional connectivity was associated with behavioral performance on
tasks of visuospatial reasoning and working memory in NF1 patients.
Future studies in larger samples are warranted, both to replicate the
current ﬁndings and to explore the extent to which the NF1 neural
signature from the SCAP task applies to other working memory-asso-
ciated tasks. Additional studies are also needed to explore the extent to
which DMN interference occurs in patients with NF1 as well as the
relationship between spatial WM dysfunction and the structural brain

abnormalities often seen in individuals with NF1.

6. Concluding remarks

In summary, our ﬁndings elucidate the link between characteristic
functional brain abnormalities in NF1 and the behavioral proﬁle while
replicating previous ﬁndings. We found that there is a distinct neural
signature associated with the visuo-spatial impairment generally ex-
hibited by NF1 patients. This distinct neural signature consists of re-
duced activation of key brain regions associated with working memory
function, abnormal activation between parietal regions and visual
cortices, and aberrant deactivation of regions associated with the de-
fault mode network, a result consistent with the hypothesis that en-
hanced neuronal inhibition contributes to cognitive deﬁcits in NF1
(Costa et al., 2002; Mainberger et al., 2013; Shilyansky et al., 2010).
These ﬁndings oﬀer initial insights into the neural mechanisms through
which NF1 inﬂuences cognitive abilities and future research should
further explore this relationship to provide a more comprehensive un-
derstanding of the eﬀects of NF1.
