Current status and recommendations for
biomarkers and biobanking in
neurofibromatosis

ABSTRACT
Objective: Clinically validated biomarkers for neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2),
and schwannomatosis (SWN) have not been identified to date. The biomarker working group’s goals
are to (1) define biomarker needs in NF1, NF2, and SWN; (2) summarize existing data on biomarkers
in NF1, NF2, and SWN; (3) outline recommendations for sample collection and biomarker develop-
ment; and (4) standardize sample collection and methodology protocols where possible to promote
comparison between studies by publishing standard operating procedures (SOPs).
Methods: The biomarker group reviewed published data on biomarkers in NF1, NF2, and SWN and
on biobanking efforts outside these diseases via literature search, defined the need for bio-
markers in NF, and developed recommendations in a series of consensus meetings.
Results: We describe existing biomarkers in NF and report consensus recommendations for SOP
and a minimal clinical dataset to accompany samples derived from patients with NF1, NF2, and
SWN in decentralized biobanks.
Conclusions: These recommendations are intended to provide clinicians and researchers with
a common set of guidelines to collect and store biospecimens and for establishment of biobanks
for NF1, NF2, and SWN. Neurology® 2016;87 (Suppl 1):S40–S48

The neurofibromatoses—neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and schwan-
nomatosis (SWN)—are genetically distinct neurocutaneous syndromes that share many features.
All 3 conditions demonstrate wide variability in disease manifestations, and are characterized by
progressive, lifelong, and potentially life-threatening complications. Standard treatment is limited
to surgery for most tumor manifestations. Given the unmet need for nonsurgical therapies, there
have been .20 clinical trials performed between 1993 and 2014 for NF1 and NF2 with varying
measures of response. Few studies have documented evidence of clinical efficacy for investigational
agents.1 To date, no biomarker-driven trials have been performed in NF.

The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International
Collaboration was created in 2011 to define and develop the most informative, reliable, and mean-
ingful endpoints for clinical trials for NF. The REiNS group is composed of several working
groups.2 The biomarker working group, which includes neurologists, oncologists, geneticists,

This article summarizes the progress toward
these goals. The biomarker group has concen-
trated on biomarkers in blood, urine, and tissue.
Imaging biomarkers are discussed separately by
the REiNS imaging working group.3

METHODS The biomarker group first performed a literature
search, and reviewed and summarized existing data on biomarkers
in NF1, NF2, and SWN. The group then met during a series of
meetings in collaboration with the Children’s Tumor Foundation
(1) to establish SOPs for sample collection of NF tissue specimens
that facilitate data comparison between studies and (2) to develop
a minimal clinical dataset that would accompany each sample.
The working group anticipates that these recommendations will
be updated periodically as new information on biomarkers be-
comes available. Detailed assay protocols will be available on the
REiNS Web site (www.reinscollaboration.org).

RESULTS Biomarkers are used for early detection of
disease or in disease classification (diagnostic biomarkers),
in predicting response or adverse events (predictive bio-
markers), in defining optimal drug dose (metabolic/phar-
macodynamic biomarkers), or in forecasting progression
or recurrence (outcome biomarkers).4 Previous natural
history studies in NF1 and NF2 have clearly demon-
strated a high degree of variability in disease phenotype
and tumor behavior in these conditions.5 This variability
introduces complexity into the identification of valid bio-
markers for NF and schwannomatosis. For example,
a biomarker could potentially correlate with the presence
of the genetic syndrome (e.g., NF1, NF2, or schwanno-
matosis), of a specific tumor type (e.g., gastrointestinal
stromal tumor in NF1), with a nontumor phenotype of
NF (e.g., pain severity in schwannomatosis), with cumu-
lative disease burden (e.g., whole body tumor burden),
with disease progression (e.g., growth of plexiform neu-
rofibroma in NF1), or with malignant transformation
(e.g., malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor from plex-
iform neurofibroma). Given the overlap in many of these
phenotypes, validating these biomarkers for individual
disease manifestations will require careful phenotyping
of patients.

Diagnostic biomarkers in NF. Historically, NF1, NF2, and
schwannomatosis have been diagnosed using established

clinical criteria. Advances in molecular techniques over
the last 2 decades have led to the availability of genetic
diagnosis for these conditions.6,7 The sensitivity of genetic
analysis for diagnosis of NF depends on the founder
status and the clinical phenotype (segmental vs general-
ized) but ranges from 30% for sporadic schwannomatosis
to .95% for NF1. When a causative genetic alteration
in the NF1, NF2, SMARCB1, or LZTR1 genes is identi-
fied, it can be used as diagnostic biomarker for related
family members. In clinical practice, this information is
used by reproductive endocrinologists for prenatal diagno-
sis or preimplantation genetic diagnosis and by genetic
counselors for presymptomatic diagnosis of family mem-
bers. However, additional diagnostic biomarkers will
undoubtedly be useful to identify patients with specific
disease features, such as plexiform neurofibromas or optic
gliomas.

Outcome biomarkers in NF. Similarly, there is great
variability in clinical outcomes for patients with NF.
For example, while optic pathway glioma occurs in
about 15% of individuals with NF1, only about 1/3
of these tumors are symptomatic, and less will progress
and require active treatment.8 Optic pathway gliomas
will even spontaneously regress without treatment.
This variability in outcome highlights the need to
develop outcome biomarkers for NF disease manifes-
tations. Outcome biomarkers provide evidence about
the patient’s disease outcome independent of any
specific intervention. A validated outcome biomarker
would be valuable to determine the long-term risk for
dermal neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumors in patients with NF1, for risk of complete
deafness in patients with NF2, and for risk of severe
chronic pain in patients with schwannomatosis.

clinical

Predictive biomarkers in NF. Over the last decade, there
has been an explosion of clinical trials for NF-related
tumors and conditions. The opportunity to study
novel agents in NF opens the possibility of developing
and incorporating biomarker studies into early clinical
trials. To date,
run through the
Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials Consortium have
included studies of pharmacodynamic biomarkers and
predictive biomarkers. As drugs with activity against
NF become available,
these studies will provide
valuable information about which patients are likely
to require treatment in the future and which are likely
to respond to therapy.

biomarkers published to date are considered exploratory;
none has been validated to achieve probable biomarker
status. Thus far, all published biomarker studies have
been performed in the setting of NF1 (table 1); there
are no published data on biomarkers in NF2 or schwan-
nomatosis. These exploratory studies are all limited by
a variety of technical issues such as limited statistical

power, lack of an independent validation set, and lack
of longitudinal data.

greater in patients with NF1 (15.2 ng/mL) than
in controls (4.5 ng/mL), in patients with NF1
with plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) than in
those without PNF, in patients with NF1 with
high numbers of cutaneous or subcutaneous
neurofibromas than in those without such tu-
mors, and in patients with NF1 with greater
internal tumor load than in those with low inter-
nal tumor load. In contrast, serum levels of MIA
were not significantly different between patients
with NF1 with and without malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). MIA as a bio-
marker for NF1 was also investigated by
another group.10 This group added the anal-
ysis of
the metabolite 5-S-cysteinyldopa
(5-S-CD). They found concordant results
with higher MIA levels in 25 patients with
NF1 compared with 14 controls (13.1 vs
9.3 ng/mL) but did not find significantly dif-
ferent levels between patients with NF1 with or
without PNF (15.1 vs 12.0 ng/mL, respectively).
In their study, serum 5-S-CD levels were signif-
icantly higher in patients with NF1 than in con-
trols and did not correlate with age. Hence, MIA
does not appear to be a robust biomarker for
distinguishing unaffected controls from patients
with NF1 or between patients with NF1 with or
without MPNST. Further work is needed to
explore the utility of 5-S-CD to distinguish
between groups.

(cid:129) Adrenomedullin (ADM)—In a study of 32 patients
with NF1 and 25 control patients,11 serum ADM
levels were significantly greater in patients with
NF1 with MPNST (0.24 ng/mL, n 5 5) than
in patients with NF1 with PNF (0.18 ng/mL,
n 5 17); however, there was significant overlap
in ADM levels between the cohorts. ADM levels
were also significantly higher in patients with NF1
with or without MPNST (0.18 ng/mL, n 5 27)
than in controls (0.07 ng/mL, n 5 25). No signif-
icant differences were noted between patients with
NF1 with or without PNF. Although the data for
ADM data are more promising than those for MIA,
the current data do not indicate that ADM is a reli-
able biomarker in NF1 and further studies are
warranted.

(cid:129) Fetal antigen 1—In a study of 13 adult patients
with NF1 and 177 adult controls,12 the median
fetal antigen 1 levels were significantly higher in
the serum of patients with NF1 (30.6 ng/mL)
than in control patients (24.9 ng/mL), although
there was considerable overlap between the
groups.12

(cid:129) Soluble growth factor receptor Axl (sAXL)—
In a study of 72 patients with NF1 and 46
healthy controls, serum levels of sAXL were

significantly increased in patients with NF1
(23 ng/mL) compared with controls (16 ng/
mL). Patients with plexiform neurofibromas
had significantly higher
sAXL
(26 ng/mL, n 5 36) than patients with
NF1 without
plexiform neurofibromas
(18 ng/mL, n 5 36) although there was still
some overlap between groups.13

Using high-resolution array-based comparative
genomic hybridization in 38 MPNSTs (23 with

validated at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels.17
Candidate genes in regions of copy number gain
and associated (predicted) with poor survival
included SOX5, NOL1, MLF2, FOXM1, FKBP1,
CDK4, TSPAN31, ERBB2, MYC, and TP53. In
multivariate analysis, FOXM1 protein expression
and CDK4 copy number gain were the most sig-
nificant independent genomic biomarkers for poor
survival in patients with MPNSTs.

(cid:129) Recently, gene expression analysis of 30 MPNSTs
and subsequent immunohistochemical staining
of 64 MPNSTs revealed a composite set of sur-
vivin (BIRC5), thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), and
topoisomerase 2-a (TOP2A) immunohistochem-
ical staining, which stratifies MPNST into high
and low risk20 independent of age, sex, tumor size,
grade, NF1 status, and surgical remission.

(cid:129) Blakeley et al.21 have detected lower blood circu-
lating levels of hepatocyte growth factor in patients
with NF2 who responded to bevacizumab. This is
the first evidence that a blood biomarker could be
used predictively to stratify patients with NF2 (n 5
13) with the highest likelihood of treatment benefit.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAMPLE COLLECTION
AND METHODOLOGY The REiNS biomarker group
discussed potential barriers to biomarker research for NF.
These barriers include the low prevalence of NF1, NF2,
and schwannomatosis, which makes coordinated studies
technically difficult and expensive; the extreme variability
of these conditions requires expert clinical researchers to
accurately phenotype patients. Based on this discussion,
the group endorsed the following goals to advance the
study of biomarkers within the NF community:

1. Build a prospective biorepository of curated sam-
ples. The aim would be to collect longitudinal
samples from each patient to facilitate the devel-
opment of early detection and prognostic markers.
2. Standardize tissue collection at participating institu-
tions. The aim would be to collect all tissues using an
identical protocol that meets standards set forth by the
American Association for Cancer Research–Food and
Drug Administration–National Cancer Institute Can-
cer Biomarker Collaborative4 and would be linked via
a shared, anonymized registry (on a Web site). Par-
ticipating sites would share common consent, SOPs,
quality control
(see supplemental data on the
Neurology® Web site at Neurology.org), minimal clin-
ical dataset, and database.

3. Annotate samples with an agreed minimal clinical
dataset. The goal is to link anonymously the pheno-
typic data to deidentified samples in the bioreposi-
tory. A proposed minimal clinical dataset developed
at a consensus meeting in October 2014 is shown in
table 2. The group anticipates that modifications of
this dataset may be required in the future to optimize
the utility of biomarker research.

4. Incorporate the decentralized biorepository into ex-
isting biorepositories that are used for diagnostic
purposes. The biomaterial could thus be used for
both diagnosis and research and is not necessarily
restricted to an upfront definition of the amount of
surplus tissue. Patient care takes preference when
allocating the amount of samples used for bio-
marker investigations.

5. Provide open access to deposited biomarkers to
facilitate research. The aim would be to have sam-
ples and data open to all qualified researchers with
approval of an institutional review board. A biorepo-
sitory council would govern database requests.

6. An operational and an executive committee will
implementation of

govern requests and audit
SOPs and quality control measures.

7. Incorporate biomarker collection into clinical studies.
When feasible, sample collection should be incorpo-
rated into prospective clinical trials and natural his-
tory studies to help develop pharmacodynamic and
predictive biomarkers.

8. Incorporate biomarker collection into routine clin-
ical visits. Patients receiving routine care should be
invited to participate in prospective sample collec-
tion during routine clinic visits.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BIOMARKERS BASED
ON EXISTING DATA

1. Validate individual biomarkers as well as cocktails/

signatures of biomarkers.

2. For ongoing and planned NF trials, studies of
drug metabolism/pharmacodynamic biomarkers
should be drug-specific.

3. For malignant tumors such as MPNST, explore
and validate cDNA, cRNA, and circulating tumor
cells as biomarkers.

4. Validate use of extracellular vesicles (exosomes) based
on encouraging preliminary data as biomarkers of
cancer.22

5. Using candidate approach, focus on the clinically
relevant questions, i.e., total tumor load, presence
of plexiform neurofibroma, evidence of malignant
transformation, and taking into account the statisti-
cal significance in published studies. We recommend
validating the following biomarker candidates in pa-
tients with NF1: BIRC5/TK1/TOP2A immunohis-
tochemistry, ADM,
interferon-g, IGFBP-1, and
sAXL.

6. Complement candidate biomarker approach with sys-
tematic unbiased approach. Encourage well-powered
studies using systematic unbiased approaches, includ-
ing genomics (DNA, RNA, miRNA next-generation
sequencing), metabolomics, and proteomics; that is,
further screening with metabolomics, proteomics,
expression arrays, and miRNA.
