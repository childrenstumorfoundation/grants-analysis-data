Purpose
To assess the value of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in children with malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and to identify risk factors associated with outcome.
Patients and Methods
A total of 167 untreated eligible patients enrolled onto the Italian and German studies
between 1975 and 1998 entered this analysis. Seventeen percent of patients had neuroﬁ-
bromatosis type 1 (NF1). Chemotherapy was administered to 74% of patients; radiotherapy
was administered to 38% of patients.
Results
With a median follow-up of 7 years, 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival
(PFS) were 51% and 37%, respectively. The 5-year OS and PFS by Intergroup Rhabdomyosar-
coma Study (IRS) groupings were as follows: group I, 82% and 61%; group II, 62% and 37%;
group III, 32% and 27%; group IV, 26% and 21%, respectively. Univariate analysis identiﬁed IRS
groups, size, invasiveness, primary site, age, and presence of NF1 as prognostic factors;
multivariate analysis identiﬁed absence of NF1, tumor invasiveness T1, IRS groups I to II and
extremity of primary site as independent favorable factors for OS. A trend was observed toward
a beneﬁt from radiotherapy after initial gross resection. The overall response rate to primary
chemotherapy, including minor responses, in group III patients was 45%.
Conclusion
MPNST is an aggressive tumor for which complete surgical resection is the mainstay of
successful treatment. Postoperative radiotherapy may have a role in improving local control
in patients with minimal residual tumor. The reported responses to primary chemotherapy
suggest that it may be effective in patients with tumor considered unresectable at diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION

A malignant peripheral-nerve sheath tumor
(MPNST) is a spindle cell sarcoma that often
arises in proximity to peripheral nerves or
shows nerve sheath differentiation. It occurs
mainly in adults and only 10% to 20% of
MPNSTs are diagnosed in the ﬁrst two de-
cades of life.1-4 They nonetheless represent
one of the most frequent nonrhabdomyo-
sarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas in pediat-

ric age.1-4 The term MPNST is preferred to
malignant schwannoma or neuroﬁbrosar-
coma because these tumors can have the
appearance of any nerve sheath cell, includ-
ing Schwann cells, perineural ﬁbroblasts, or
ﬁbroblasts.1-4 Usually, the clinical presenta-
tion is an enlarging soft tissue mass arising in
the trunk, extremities, or head and neck re-
gion, with or without pain and dysesthesia;
most of the lesions are deep seated. A nerve
of origin can be identiﬁed in more than 70%

of patients.1-4 MPNST may develop in a pre-existing neu-
roﬁbroma in approximately 40% of patients, and particu-
larly in patients with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1).2,5-7
Patients with NF1 have a greater risk of multiple neural
crest-derived tumors and other malignancies. The onset of
MPNST in these patients is well known; in different re-
ported series of MPNSTs, 21% to 67% of tumors occurred
in patients with NF1.7,8 A lifetime MPNST risk of 8% to
13% was reported in a recent study, however.9

Because of the rarity of this tumor, there are few pub-
lished reports and little information is available on its clin-
ical management, particularly in pediatric patients.1,3,4,10-18
MPNST is reported to behave aggressively, with a high rate
of local recurrence and a propensity to metastasize. The
outcome seems favorable only when a small and localized
tumor can be excised completely.1 Surgical resection repre-
sents the mainstay of treatment, whereas the role of adju-
vant treatment is unclear as yet; the effectiveness of
chemotherapy and radiotherapy in this tumor is a relevant
issue awaiting some answers.

To contribute additional information on the clinical
management of childhood MPNST, we report on a large
series of pediatric patients recruited over a 25-year period
according to the protocols of the German Cooperative Soft
Tissue Sarcoma Group (CWS), the Italian Cooperative
Group (ICG) on childhood soft tissue sarcoma, and the
Istituto Nazionale Tumori (INT) of Milan, Italy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

A total of 167 consecutive previously untreated children and ado-
lescents with a diagnosis of MPNST were enrolled onto different
protocols between December 1975 and December 1998. The Ger-
man studies (CWS-81, CWS-86, CWS-91, and CWS-96) included
91 patients, whereas 76 patients were enrolled at Italian centers (51
in the ICG protocols RMS-79, RMS-88, and RMS-96; 25 in the
INT protocols up until 1996, after which INT patients were in-
cluded in the ICG studies). This set of patients represented 5% of
all pediatric soft tissue sarcomas registered by the two Cooperative
Study Groups during the study period (N ⫽ 3,265).

All patients, or their guardians, provided their informed con-
sent to the studies, according to the established rules. Clinical data,
treatment modalities, and outcomes were reviewed. The his-
topathologic diagnoses were reviewed centrally by the pathology
panel of each cooperative group at the time of diagnosis. All
pathology forms were reviewed for the purpose of this analysis.
Unfortunately, tumor grade was available only in a minority of
patients because the data were not reported in early patients, or
when only a biopsy specimen was available.

Clinical Grouping

Investigations at diagnosis included physical examination,
evaluation of local extent with computed tomography (CT)
and/or nuclear magnetic resonance scan, staging evaluation with
conventional chest x-ray or chest CT scan, abdominal ultrasound,
and whole body bone scan.

Disease was staged according to both the clinical TNM pre-
treatment staging system19 and the Intergroup Rhabdomyosar-
coma Study (IRS) postsurgical grouping system.20 The TNM
deﬁnition of T1 refers to tumors conﬁned to the organ or tissue of
origin, whereas T2 lesions invade contiguous structures; T1 and
T2 groups are further classiﬁed as A or B according to tumor
diameter, ⱕ or more than 5 cm, respectively. Regional node in-
volvement was designated as N1 (no node involvement, N0);
distant metastases at onset was designated as M1 (no metastases,
M0).19 After initial surgery, patients were classiﬁed according to
the IRS system: group I includes completely excised tumors, group
II indicates grossly resected tumors with microscopic residual
disease and/or resected regional lymph node involvement, group
III includes patients with gross residual disease after incomplete
resection or biopsy, and group IV comprises patients with metas-
tases at onset.20

Treatment

Patients were treated mainly using multimodality therapeu-
tic approaches, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiother-
apy, based on protocols adopted over the years. Overall treatment
strategies did not change substantially during the study period,
although in some instances decisions about any adjuvant che-
motherapy and postoperative radiotherapy for patients who
had had complete primary resection were customized and de-
pended on the physician’s attitude, resulting in some differ-
ences in the choices of treatment.

Primary excision was attempted when complete and nonmu-
tilating resection was considered feasible; otherwise, a biopsy was
taken, and chemotherapy was administered to reduce the tumor
and make it resectable at subsequent surgery. In some patients,
primary re-excision (deﬁned as a second operation performed
within 2 months of the ﬁrst surgery) was recommended before
any other treatment if microscopic residual disease was sus-
pected and considered removable. In patients considered unre-
sectable at diagnosis, delayed surgery was considered after three
cycles of primary chemotherapy and (in some patients) preop-
erative radiotherapy.

Different chemotherapeutic regimens (used for rhabdomyo-
sarcoma protocols) were adopted over the years. Table 1 lists the
various chemotherapy schedules used. The ﬁrst Italian12 and
German13 protocols and the INT14 protocol used VACA or VAC/
CAV regimens including vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophospha-
mide, and dactinomycin. Ifosfamide replaced cyclophosphamide
in VAIA and IVA regimens. Carboplatin and etoposide were used
in the CEVAIE schedule or as two-drug therapy. In addition, a
combination of cisplatinum (CDDP) and etoposide or other reg-
imens (without ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide) were used in
10 patients. Primary chemotherapy was given to patients con-
sidered unresectable at diagnosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy was
suggested after initial gross resection in the presence of large
tumors (⬎ 5 in diameter).

Radiotherapy was administered, concomitantly with chemo-
therapy, to patients considered at risk of local relapse due to
micro- or macroscopically incomplete resection, or tumor size.
The indication for postoperative radiotherapy (ie, radiotherapy
after complete resection or after delayed surgery, and the doses)
was not standardized, however. Radiotherapy was delivered using
megavoltage photon or electron beam energies, with conventional
fractionation (1.8 to 2.0 Gy daily for 5 days a week) or with
hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (two daily fractions of
1.6 Gy, with a 6- to 8-hour interval). The recommended dose

changed over the years and also varied, according to the presence
of microscopic residual disease or gross tumor, from 65 to 70 Gy
(recommended dose for unresectable gross tumor in the earlier
studies) to 45 Gy (recommended dose using a hyperfractionated
accelerated modality for microscopic residues). The radiation tar-
get volume included the initial mass plus 2- to 3-cm margins and
the surgical scars as well. For unresectable tumor, radiotherapy
was given both preoperatively (starting at weeks 7 to 10) and
postoperatively (weeks 11 to 13), on the strength of customized
decisions based on a multidisciplinary discussion.

Response to primary chemotherapy was evaluated after 9
weeks of treatment (three cycles), and was based on the reduction
in volume of all measurable lesions, deﬁned as follows: complete
response (CR), complete disappearance of disease; partial re-
sponse (PR), tumor volume reduction more than two thirds of the
initial tumor volume; and minor response (MR), a reduction
more than one third to less than two thirds of the initial tumor
volume. Stable disease or a reduction less than one third was
recorded as no response, although an increase in tumor size or the
detection of new lesions was considered as progression of disease.

Statistical Methods

Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method.21 Patients
were evaluated from the date of diagnosis up to disease progres-
sion or relapse for PFS, and up to death for OS. The time scale
extended up to the latest follow-up if none of these events was
observed. The log-rank test was used to compare the survival
curves for the different subgroups of patients.22 The statistical
signiﬁcance of each variable was then tested by multivariate anal-
ysis using the stepwise model and Cox regression analysis to estab-
lish the potential value of the prognostic factors.23 The ␹2 test was
used to compare different radiotherapy modalities between sub-
sets of patients.

Patient follow-up, as of January 2004, ranged from 28.5

months to 28.9 years (median, 7.3 years).

RESULTS

Clinical Characteristics

In all, 167 patients with MPNST were treated during
the study period. In two patients, MPNST occurred as a
second tumor, 2 and 12 years after the diagnosis of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, re-
spectively. Table 2 lists the clinical features of all patients as
a whole, and in the groups with and without NF1. Age at
diagnosis ranged from 1 week to 20 years. The most com-
mon primary sites were the extremities (40%). Most pa-
tients had large, invasive tumors (⬎ 5 cm, 64%; T2, 54%).
Regional lymph node involvement at onset was recorded in
6% of patients, distant metastases was recorded in 9% of
patients (the sites of metastases were the lung in 10 patients,
the brain in two patients, the liver and bone in one patient
each, and not speciﬁed in one patient). The two patients
with brain metastases were symptomatic, and brain CT scan
was prompted by the symptoms (pain in one patient, sei-
zure in the other patient); the primary tumor site was the
trunk in one patient and the head/neck region (parameni-
ngeal site) in the other patient. Seventeen percent of pa-
tients had NF1. The treatment given to patients according
to the IRS grouping system is summarized in Table 3.

Surgery

At diagnosis, 78 patients had a grossly complete tumor
resection: 48 patients were classiﬁed as IRS group I because
they had histologically free margins. Thirty were classiﬁed
as IRS group II because they had microscopic residual dis-
ease (marginal resection). It is worth noting that, of the 44
patients with initial marginal resection, 14 (32%) were
reclassiﬁed to a lower group (to group I) after primary

resurgery. Overall, 35 patients were treated with surgery
alone (ie, 27 of the 48 classiﬁed as group I and eight of the 30
in group II).

Among the 74 patients in group III, 37 had incomplete
tumor resection and 37 had only biopsy; 24 of 74 subse-
quently had delayed surgery, 20 after chemotherapy (three
cycles), three after chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and
one after radiotherapy alone. Delayed surgery involved am-
putation in four patients and conservative resection in 20
patients (which was complete in 11 patients, with suspected
microscopic disease in six patients, and with macroscopic
residual tumor in three patients).
Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy was administered to 124 patients (74%;
ie, 15 of 15 children with metastatic disease, 70 of 74 pa-
tients in group III, 20 of 30 in group II, and 19 of 48 in group
I). Response to chemotherapy (at week 9) was assessable in
64 patients with measurable disease (57 in group III and
seven in group IV). Responses included two CRs (3%), 16

PRs (25%), and 11 MRs (17%); 35 patients had no response.
The overall response rate was 45%.

Considering the different chemotherapy regimens, the
response rate was 65% (24 of 37) to regimens including
ifosfamide (VAIA, IVA, CEVAIE), 17% (three of 17) to
those including cyclophosphamide (VACA, VAC/CAV),
and 20% (two of 10) to the other regimens (including
cisplatin and etoposide; P ⫽ .002).

A signiﬁcantly lower response rate was obtained in
patients with NF1 than in those without NF1; 17.6% (three
of 17) and 55.3% (26 of 47), respectively (P ⫽ .007).

Radiotherapy

Radiation therapy was given to 63 patients: 12 of 48
patients in group I, 11 of 30 in group II, 35 of 74 in group III,
and ﬁve of 15 in group IV. In most patients, radiation
therapy was administered concomitantly with chemother-
apy, starting between the 10th and 14th week of treatment.
The total dose ranged from 45 to 70 Gy (median, 50 Gy).

Table 4 lists the local treatment failures by IRS group-
ing in patients with and without radiotherapy. Among all of
the patients with localized disease, local progression or re-
lapse occurred in 51% of patients (77 of 152). Radiotherapy
failed to maintain or achieve local tumor control in 26 of 58
patients (45%). A better local control rate was obtained in
irradiated patients (and particularly in cases with minimal
residual disease), but the difference was not statistically
signiﬁcant. Not enough data were available to analyze the
effect of different radiotherapy doses and fractionation.
Outcome

After a median follow-up of 7.3 years, PFS was 37.2% at
5 years (95% CI, 29.6% to 44.7%) and 34.5% at 10 years
(95% CI, 26.6% to 42.5%), and OS was 51.1% (95% CI,
43.2% to 59.0%) and 43.4% (95% CI, 34.7% to 52.0%) at 5
and 10 years, respectively (Fig 1).

Survival rates were analyzed chronologically, arbi-
trarily deﬁning two periods (from 1975 to 1985 and from
1986 to 1998), which differed in terms of radiologic assess-
ment (with the introduction of magnetic resonance imag-
ing) and chemotherapy regimens (with the introduction of
ifosfamide): 5-year OS and PFS was 41% and 29% in the

ﬁrst period (39 patients) and 54% and 41%, respectively, in
the second period (128 patients), with P ⫽ .2 for OS and
P ⫽ .04 for PFS.

At the time of this analysis, 58 patients were alive in ﬁrst
CR, 13 patients were alive in second CR, and three patients
were alive with disease (another four patients were lost to
follow-up with disease). The 5-year local failure-free sur-
vival rate was 47.4% (95% CI, 39.5% to 55.3%), whereas the
5-year metastasis-free survival rate was 80.7% (95% CI,
73.8% to 87.7%), indicating that local failure represented
the major cause of death.

Treatment failure was observed in 102 patients (61%),
usually involving local progression or relapse (83%): local
progression occurred in 32 patients, local and metastatic
progression occurred in four patients, local relapse oc-
curred in 42 patients, local relapse with the development of
new metastases occurred in seven patients, and metastases
occurred in 17 patients (10 with pulmonary spread). Time
to relapse was 2 to 119 months for local treatment failures
(median, 11 months from diagnosis), and 5 to 152 months
for distant treatment failures (median, 16 months). Consid-
ering the patients with local relapse alone, 11 (26%) of 42
were alive in second CR, whereas only one of 24 (4%) was
alive without evidence of disease in the subset of patients
with distant relapse (with or without local relapse).

Overall, 89 patients died, 84 as a result of their disease,
four as a result of treatment-related toxicity, and one as a
result of a second tumor (cerebral glioma in a patient with
NF1 treated with surgery alone).

IRS Group I Patients

Patients with complete surgical resection at diagnosis
(48 patients) represented the subset with the best outcome
(OS, 79.1% at 10 years): 27 of them were treated with
surgery alone, 11 of whom experienced relapse and had a
5-year PFS of 61%. Adjuvant treatment was given to 21
group I patients (10 chemotherapy and radiotherapy, nine
chemotherapy, and two radiotherapy): nine of 21 experi-
enced relapse and had a 5-year PFS of 60%.

Given that no fully standardized approach to the treat-
ment of these patients was used over the years (the decision to
administer adjuvant therapies was sometimes individualized),

a comparison of the incidence of the main prognostic fac-
tors was performed between the two groups (patients
treated with surgery only v those also treated with postop-
erative therapies), which showed a higher (but not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant) incidence of unfavorable characteristics in
the latter group (T2, 18% v 28%; size ⬎ 5 cm, 33% v 52%;
age ⬎ 10 years, 40% v 62%; NF1, 11% v 19%). This ﬁnding
may inﬂuence our results. In particular, if we only consider
local failure in IRS group I patients, the use of radiotherapy
would seem to improve local control, as indicated by a
lower local relapse rate in irradiated patients (17% v 36%;
Table 4). The difference was not statistically signiﬁcant,
however, probably because of the small number of patients
involved. Irradiated patients had better local control despite
a higher incidence of large tumors (58% v 36%) and older
age (75% v 41%). IRS group I patients with tumors more
than 5 cm had more local and metastatic relapses (11 of 18)
than those with tumors less than 5 cm (seven of 28; P ⫽ .01).
IRS Group II Patients

Among the 30 patients classiﬁed as IRS group II after
initial surgery, eight were treated with surgery alone and 22
were treated with chemotherapy (11 patients), radiotherapy
(two patients), or both (nine patients). PFS at 5 years was
higher in patients given adjuvant treatment (41% v 25% for
those treated with surgery alone), despite most of the pa-
tients having tumors more than 5 cm (72% v 37% in the
group treated with surgery alone). As in the group I pa-
tients, the local failure rate was higher in nonirradiated
patients, but not signiﬁcantly so (Table 4).

To analyze the role of chemotherapy, we compared
patients treated with surgery alone (eight children) versus
patients treated with surgery plus chemotherapy,11 exclud-
ing patients who also received radiotherapy. The 5-year PFS

rates were similar in the two groups (25% v 27.2%). Here
again, patients receiving chemotherapy had larger tumors
at diagnosis (70% v 45%).

IRS Group III to IV Patients

In group III, chemotherapy was administered to 70 of
74 patients, thus preventing any comparison between sub-
sets of patients who had or had not received systemic treat-
ment. Tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was
nonetheless observed in the 57 assessable group III patients
and had a favorable impact on OS: the 5-year OS was 50%
(95% CI, 30% to 70%) and 5.4% (95% CI, 0% to 15%) in
responders (including minor responses) and nonresponders,
respectively (P ⫽ .004). Eleven patients with tumors
considered unresectable at diagnosis had delayed com-
plete resection after the tumor size was reduced with
chemotherapy (six PR and ﬁve MR) and seven of 11
patients were alive with no evidence of disease at the time
of this report.

In group IV, the three long-term survivors achieved CR

with chemotherapy and surgery.

Prognostic Factors

Table 5 lists the univariate analysis comparing the esti-
mated PFS and OS of the different patient subsets stratiﬁed
by clinical characteristics at diagnosis. Statistically signiﬁ-
cant differences in outcome emerged in relation to extent of
surgery (IRS group), tumor size, local invasiveness, site of
primary lesion, presence of NF1, and age at diagnosis. Sur-
vival was particularly poor in patients with NF1.

In multivariate analysis, the factors correlated inde-
pendently and signiﬁcantly with favorable OS were absence
of NF1, noninvasive local tumor status (T1), small tumor
size (⬍ 5 cm), IRS groups I to II, and the extremities as the

primary site. The same factors (except for IRS group) were
signiﬁcant for PFS.
NF1 Patients

The 29 patients with NF1 form a particular subset. Table 2
compares the clinical ﬁndings for these patients with patients
without NF1. Most NF1 patients were older than 10 years old
and had large, invasive, unresectable tumors.

The rate of response to chemotherapy was signiﬁcantly
lower in NF1 patients: 17.6% v 55.3% in patients without
NF1 (P ⫽ .007). NF1 was one of the most signiﬁcant prog-
nostic factors, as listed in Tables 5 and 6: the outcome was
extremely poor in NF1 patients, with a 5-year OS of 32%
and PFS of 19%.

DISCUSSION

Our study deals with the largest reported series of MPNST
in children and adolescents, drawing data from different
countries and different protocols performed over the years.
The primary aim of this analysis was to attempt to deﬁne the
optimal treatment strategy. MPNST is a rare malignancy, so
a prospective randomized trial on the role of adjuvant treat-
ment has not been feasible to date.

The results of our study indicate that complete surgical
removal is the mainstay of treatment and a strong predictor
of survival; thus, every effort should be made to perform
adequate initial surgery with free histologic margins. Un-
fortunately, MPNST is locally aggressive: failure to achieve
local control remains the major cause of treatment failure,
but complete surgical excision at diagnosis is rarely feasible
(it was achieved in ⬍ one third of the patients in this series).
Primary re-excision has to be recommended (where feasi-
ble) for inadequate surgical margins at the ﬁrst operation: in
our series, 14 of 44 patients (32%) who initially had mar-
ginal resection achieved microscopically free margins after
primary re-excision and were therefore reclassiﬁed lower to
group I. The need to obtain free histologic margins is also
suggested by the poor PFS in our subset of IRS group II
patients (36.7% at 5 years). However, we can not exclude
that the inferior outcome in group II patients compared
with those in group I may have been due to other factors
such as the preponderance of invasive (T2, 47% v 24%) and
large (size ⬎ 5 cm, 60% v 39%) tumors.

This is even more evident in patients considered
unresectable at diagnosis (group III), whose unfavor-
able outcome (5-year PFS, 27%) is consistent with other
published pediatric series (see the experiences of the

Complete surgery would seem insufﬁcient, however, in
quite a large proportion of cases: 5-year PFS was only 61%
in IRS group I patients (v ﬁgures reportedly approximately
80% for other nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas
[NRSTS]),24 and local relapse was the major cause of failure
in this group too.

Our data can throw little light on the role of adjuvant
treatments. The lack of a fully standardized therapeutic
approach, the limited number of patients in each subset,
and the imbalance in the prognostic factors are the short-
comings of our analysis. Regarding patients in IRS group I,
we were unable to demonstrate a survival advantage in the
group given adjuvant treatment, but they also had a higher
incidence of unfavorable features (large and invasive tu-
mors, age older than 10 years), so it may be that adjuvant
treatment succeeded in counteracting their negative effect.
After microscopically incomplete surgery, the local re-
lapse rate seems better in patients who received radiothera-
py—a ﬁnding partially consistent with other reports,14,15
suggesting possible beneﬁts of irradiation in controlling
microscopic residual tumor, whereas the effect of radio-
therapy in patients with gross disease remains uncertain.
Wanebo et al15 suggested that adjuvant radiotherapy also be
used in completely resected patients when tumors are large
(⬎ 5 cm) and invasive, or at unfavorable sites.

Although the lack of local control is the major cause of
treatment failure, distant metastases can occur. The role of
systemic chemotherapy is not entirely clear. Favorable re-
sponses to chemotherapy have only been reported occa-
sionally, so MPNST is regarded as a scarcely responsive

tumor.12 In published series,13,17,18 patients treated with
adjuvant chemotherapy showed no signiﬁcantly better out-
come. But 74% of patients received chemotherapy in the
current series and the overall response rate in patients with
measurable disease after primary chemotherapy (45% re-
sponse rate with 28% of major responses) is remarkable,
particularly using regimens containing ifosfamide (65%).
Moreover, in some patients the limited tumor shrinkage
achieved by chemotherapy enabled a delayed conservative
surgery that had been considered unfeasible at diagnosis.
For the time being, primary chemotherapy should be at-
tempted, in our opinion, in all patients when a macroscop-
ically complete conservative surgery is initially unfeasible.
The potential beneﬁt of adjuvant chemotherapy is even
more uncertain. Our data are unable to demonstrate the
merits of adjuvant chemotherapy, but we know that a large
subset of surgically resected patients have a poor outcome,
partly due to the onset of distant metastases.

Aggressive therapeutic approaches are mandatory in pa-
tients at high risk (ie, with large, invasive, unresectable tumors
on the trunk or in the head and neck). In such patients, even
mutilating surgery must be considered if primary chemother-
apy fails to shrink the tumor.

OS was particularly discouraging in children with NF1,
whatever the treatment used. This may be due to various
factors such as the unfavorable clinical presentation and the
poor response to chemotherapy. Moreover, every effort
should be made to plan a careful follow-up in patients with
NF1 to enable the early diagnosis of MPNST (as well as
other malignancies, such as glioma and leukemia, for which
these patients are at risk).

Carli et al

The number of patients in our study permitted a statis-
tical analysis capable of deﬁning the most important prog-
nostic factors. In addition to the presence of NF1, the extent
of surgery, tumor size, local invasiveness, and primary site
were statistically signiﬁcant for prognosis.

In our series, histologic grades were unfortunately un-
available for most patients, so we could offer no informa-
tion on their role as a predictor of outcome. Histologic
grade is now considered one of the most important prog-
nostic factors for pediatric NRSTS and adult soft tissue
sarcomas.24 High-grade tumors have a greater propensity to
metastasize and may, in principle, have a greater chance of
beneﬁting from chemotherapy, so grading should be con-
sidered essential in deciding whether chemotherapy is indi-
cated. The fact that most of the tumors in our patients had
not been graded is clearly a weakness of our analysis, but it is
worth noting that recently published data indicate that
grading may not have a prognostic value for MPNST.8,25

In summary, MPNST is a rare tumor that behaves
aggressively, with a particularly high rate of local recur-
rence, although distant metastases can also occur. Overall
outcome is not as satisfactory as in other pediatric soft tissue

sarcomas. Aggressive treatments are required in all cases
with adverse prognostic factors. The new European proto-
col for NRSTS (developed by the new European Pediatric
Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study Group) includes MPNST pa-
tients in the group with adult-type soft tissue sarcomas, and
recommends adjuvant therapies according to the risk of
local and distant relapse, based on residual disease after
initial surgery, tumor size, and grade. Although our data are
inconclusive in this direction, adjuvant chemotherapy with
an ifosfamide/doxorubicin regimen will be recommended
to patients with grade 3 tumors larger than 5 cm.26,27 Mean-
while, biologic studies are opening new prospects for the
treatment of these tumors, identifying new potential thera-
peutic targets, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor,
which is overexpressed in NF1 patients with high-grade
MPNST and may play a part in their tumorigenesis.28
