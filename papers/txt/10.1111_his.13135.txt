SMARCE1 mutation screening in classiﬁcation of clear cell meningiomas

Aims: Clear cell meningioma (CCM) is a rare subtype
of meningioma and shows not only unusual histol-
ogy, but also unique clinical
features. Recently,
SMARCE1 mutations have been shown to cause
spinal and cranial CCMs. We present 12 cases which
were diagnosed with CCM in a single institution
between 1997 and 2014, and investigate their
SMARCE1 mutation status.
Methods and results: To investigate the SMARCE1
mutation status of these tumours, we used a combina-
tion of Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-
dependent probe ampliﬁcation analysis and also
performed SMARCE1 immunohistochemical staining.
We found both SMARCE1 mutational hits, including
novel SMARCE1 mutations,
tested

in six of eight

Keywords: SMARCE1, meningioma, clear cell

patients. Immunohistochemical analysis showed loss
of SMARCE1 protein staining in all but two cases. Two
individuals who were diagnosed originally with CCM
were negative for SMARCE1 mutations, but tested pos-
itive for NF2 mutations. As a result, these two tumours
were re-analysed and eventually reclassiﬁed, as a
microcystic and a mixed pattern of meningothelial
meningioma with focal clear cell areas, respectively.
Conclusions: These results expand the spectrum of
pathogenic variants in SMARCE1 and show that
mutation screening can help to facilitate meningioma
classiﬁcation. This may have implications for prognosis
and future clinical management of patients, as CCMs
are classed as grade II tumours, while microcystic and
meningothelial meningiomas are classed as grade I.

childhood brain tumours.3 While most meningiomas
have a good prognosis, high recurrence rates have
been observed for World Health Organization (WHO)
grades II and III meningiomas.4 Among grades II and
III meningiomas, clear cell meningioma (CCM)
is
rare, consisting of only 0.2–0.81% of all menin-
giomas.5 Histologically, CCMs are characterized by
patternless distribution of polygonal cells with a clear,
glycogen-rich cytoplasm and blocky, perivascular and
interstitial collagen. CCMs show not only unusual
histology, but also unique clinical features. They tend

SMARCE1 mutation in clear cell meningioma 815

to occur in young patients, and are more likely to
recur or metastasize than other common subtypes.6
Recurrence and CNS metastasis occurred in 37.8 and
8.1% of the cases reported in the literature, respec-
tively.6

Although the molecular genetic alterations occur-
ring in meningiomas have not yet been elucidated
fully,5,7 meningiomas exhibit a wide spectrum of
molecular alterations. NF2 mutations are the most
common somatic genetic alteration found in sporadic
meningiomas, and germline mutation of
the NF2
gene is known to predispose to multiple menin-
type 2
giomas as part of

the neuroﬁbromatosis

(NF2) phenotype.8 Genomic sequencing of a subset
of meningiomas lacking NF2 alteration elucidated
recurrent SMO and AKT1 mutations, which have
the potential to guide new therapeutic strategies.9
Furthermore, genomic changes are associated with
histological subtype and genomic data of various
subtypes are expected to facilitate more accurate his-
tological grading and subtyping.10–13 In case of
CCM, germline loss-of-function mutations
in the
SMARCE1 chromatin remodelling factor were identi-
ﬁed as a cause of both spinal and cranial CCM.8,14
To date, 12 families with SMARCE1-associated CCM
have

CCM has also been reported in one child diagnosed
with NF2 disease on clinical grounds19 and one
adult, also on clinical grounds,16 while most menin-

cases which were diagnosed as a CCM in a single
institute in Korea during an 18-year period. We
investigated the involvement of SMARCE1 mutation
in these tumours.

A retrospective search of the pathology database at
the Samsung Medical Center, using the term ‘CCM’,
identiﬁed a total of 14 samples from 12 patients.
All patients underwent surgery at the neurosurgery
unit of the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South
Korea, between 1997 and 2014. For patient 5,
who underwent a two-staged operation, two surgi-
cal specimens (5-1 and 5-2) were included. Patient
6 underwent an initial operation at an outside hos-
pital. The sample used in this study was a recur-
rent
tumour with a 9-year interval. The primary
tumour sample for this patient was not available.
For patient 11, who showed progression of disease,
the initial
tumour (11-1) and progressed tumour
(11-2), with a 3-month interval, were analysed. A
blood sample was also acquired from this patient.
All patients were followed-up until October 2015,
with a median follow-up time of 59 months. For-
malin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE)
tissue was
obtained from a retrospectively collected archive.

spinal
tumours and seven cranial
tumours. The tumour
sites were as follows: spinal cord, frontal lobe, cerebel-
lomedullary cistern, cerebellopontine angle, and falx
cerebelli and low cranial nerve. The sample from
patient 6 was a recurrent tumour (9-year interval)
and patient 11 showed disease progression (3-month
interval). However, to date, none of the patients have
died due to tumour recurrence or progression. All

To investigate the SMARCE1 mutation status of
these tumours, we used a combination of Sanger
sequencing and MLPA analysis
(Table 2). Four
tumours were excluded from genetic analysis due to
poor DNA quality. We found two SMARCE1 muta-
tional hits in each of six out of eight tested patients.
We

nonsense mutations, three frameshift mutations and
one indel. These included three novel mutations
located in exons 3 [c.23delC, p.(Pro9Hisfs*62)] and
10 [(c.831delA, p.(Lys277Lys*1) and (c.957delC,
p.(Pro320Leufs*122)]. The SMARCE1 exon 9 muta-
tion, c.715C>T, p.(R239*), identiﬁed in one patient,
has been seen previously in another cohort.14 In the
current study this mutation was associated with a
recurrent tumour.

For patient 11, showing tumour progression, an
identical mutation, c.331G>T, p.(E111*), was found
in both the original and progressed tumour samples
(11-1 and 11-2). A blood sample was available for
analysis and we were able to conﬁrm the presence of
this mutation in the germline. Two surgical speci-
mens for the tumour from patient 5 (5-1 and 5-2)
also showed identical mutations.

Tumours

from three individuals contained two
point mutations, rather than one point mutation and
loss of heterozygosity (LOH). These included an exon
6 splice-site mutation and an exon 10 frameshift in
the cranial CCM of a 16-year-old male; two frameshift
mutations involving exons 3 and 8 were identiﬁed in
the spinal CCM of a 19-year-old female. Finally, a
nonsense mutation in exon 6 and a frameshift alter-
ation in exon 10 were detected in the spinal CCM of
a 10-year-old female.

As we identiﬁed two NF2 alterations in each of these
last
two tumours, SMARCE1 protein staining was
positive, and as we could not ﬁnd SMARCE1 muta-
tions in either of these tumours, the tissue was re-
assessed (by SA, YS and DdP). It was determined that
the major histology for the tumour from patient 8
was, in fact, microcystic (Figure 2). For patient 9, the
tumour contained a focal clear cell component; how-
ever, the tumour was heterogeneous in composition,
also containing meningothelial and small cell con-
stituents (Figure 2).

After removing these two males without conven-
tional CCM morphology, the male-to-female ratio was
6:4 and cranial-to-spinal
tumour ratio was equal
(5:5). In this cohort, the mean and median ages at
diagnosis of meningioma were not signiﬁcantly differ-
ent between males (27 and 24 years, respectively)
and females (23 and 24.5 years, respectively).

Discussion

Meningiomas consist of various histological subtypes
which appear to be determined by distinct genetic
alterations. Recently, several large-scale genomic stud-
ies of meningioma extended our knowledge of somatic
molecular alteration in various
types of menin-
gioma.9,10,13,21,22 These data can be used to ﬁne-tune
diagnostic accuracy, both subtyping and potentially
grading.11–13,21 In CCM, germline loss-of-function
mutations in the SMARCE1 chromatin remodelling
factor were identiﬁed as a cause of both spinal and cra-
nial CCM.14,16 To date, including the current study,
pathogenic SMARCE1 mutations have been associated
with CCM in individuals from 20 separate families. The
majority of identiﬁed SMARCE1 mutations are non-
sense or frameshift variants, predicted to lead to pro-
tein inactivation and complete loss of
the protein
product. Previous studies have shown two unrelated
families to have a large multi-exon deletion, while one
family has an intra-exonic inversion mutation and two
families have a small exonic indel (Table 1). To date,
missense mutations have not been associated with
CCM. The majority of SMARCE1 nonsense and frame-
shift mutations have been found in exon 6. The func-
tional signiﬁcance of this region is highlighted further
by three splice-site mutations that have been found in
exons 5 and 6, with the potential
to generate

aberrantly spliced transcripts and therefore to perturb
protein structure and function. However, immunohis-
tochemical analysis of available tissue has shown loss
of SMARCE1 protein in all SMARCE1 mutation-posi-
tive tumours, suggesting that
if any alternatively
spliced products are generated, they are unstable.

Mutational analysis in the current cohort identiﬁed
two SMARCE1 mutations in eight tumours from six
people. No SMARCE1 mutations were identiﬁed in
two remaining tumours, but
two mutational hits
were identiﬁed in NF2 (a point mutation and LOH) in
each tumour. Each of these NF2-mutated tumours
showed an unconventional morphology for CCM, and

subsequent re-analysis of their histology established
one to be a microcystic meningioma (patient 8) and
the other to have a mixed histology (patient 9).
Microcystic meningiomas are known to be problem-
atic to distinguish from CCMs. The tumour from
patient 9 contained a focal clear cell component;
however, the tumour was heterogeneous in composi-
tion, also containing meningothelial and small cell
constituents (Figure 2).

CCMs are classed as grade II meningiomas and show
unique clinical features. They tend to occur in young
patients, and are more likely to recur or metastasize
than other common subtypes.6 In this cohort the mean

and median ages at diagnosis of meningioma were not
signiﬁcantly different between males (27 and 24 years,
respectively) and females (23 and 24.5 years, respec-
tively). This is in contrast to previous studies, indicat-
ing an earlier onset in males versus females. The
reason for this is unknown. However, as the mutation
status in tumours from four adult males is unknown
and no lymphocyte DNA was available for any of these
patients to test germline status, it is possible that these
are sporadic tumours occurring at a later age, while
the younger male patients have a germline predisposi-
tion. The limitations of this study are that the follow-
up period was relatively short for some patients and
germline DNA was only available for one patient, limit-
ing our ability to determine which cases were due to
germline mutation and which were sporadic.

This study adds to the known spectrum of menin-
gioma-associated variants in SMARCE1 and the natu-
ral history of CCMs. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
study examining SMARCE1 mutation status in Asian
patients with CCM. It also demonstrates the utility of
genetic screening in accurate classiﬁcation of menin-
giomas. This may have implications for future clinical
management of patients, as CCMs are classed as grade
II tumours, while microcystic are classed as grade I.
The study ﬁndings also raise the prospect that menin-
giomas with focal clear cell components do not share
the same genotype as conventional, ‘pure’ CCM and
may not, by implication, carry the same adverse prog-
nosis. This, however, requires validation, requiring the
genotyping of larger numbers of mixed meningiomas
with focal clear cell areas.
