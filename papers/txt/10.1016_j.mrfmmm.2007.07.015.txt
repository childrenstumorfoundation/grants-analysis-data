Abstract

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of bilateral
schwannomas of the eighth cranial nerve. Although the protein product of the NF2 gene (merlin) is
a classical tumor suppressor, the mechanism by which merlin suppresses cell proliferation is not fully
understood. The availability of isolated tumor cells would facilitate a better understanding of the
molecular function of merlin, but primary schwannoma cells obtained from patients grow slowly and
do not yield adequate numbers for biochemical analysis. In this study, we have examined the NF2
mutation in HEI-193 cells, an immortalized cell line derived from the schwannoma of an NF2 patient.
Previous work showed that the NF2 mutation in HEI-193 cells causes a splicing defect in the NF2
transcript. We have confirmed this result and further identified the resultant protein product as an
isoform of merlin previously designated as isoform 3. The level of isoform 3 protein in HEI-193 cells
is comparable to the levels of merlin isoforms 1 and 2 in normal human Schwann cells and several
other immortalized cell lines. In contrast to many mutant forms of merlin, isoform 3 is as resistant
to proteasomal degradation as isoforms 1 and 2 and can interact with each of these isoforms in
vivo. Cell proliferation assays showed that, in NF2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, exogenously
expressed merlin isoform 3 does exhibit growth suppressive activity although it is significantly lower
than that of identically expressed merlin isoform 1. These results indicate that, although HEI-193
cells have undetectable levels of merlin isoforms 1 and 2, they are, in fact, not a merlin-null model
because they express the moderately active growth-suppressive merlin isoform 3.

for the formation of meningioma and spinal ependymoma [1]. The gene responsible for NF2
was cloned in 1993 [2,3]. The NF2 transcript can be alternatively spliced to form many NF2
variants [4,5], the most abundant of which are isoforms 1 and 2, which comprise approximately
90% of the mature NF2 transcript within cells ([6], see Fig. 1). Only isoform 1 has been shown
to suppress cell growth in cell model systems [7].

The mechanism by which merlin regulates cell proliferation is not fully understood. Merlin
can block Rac-mediated signaling [8], perhaps directly through inhibition of Pak activity [9].
Consistent with this notion, tumor-derived NF2−/− schwannoma cells display aberrant
membrane ruffling that is characteristic of hyperactivated Rac [10]. This phenotype can be
corrected by addition of dominant negative Rac [10] or wild type merlin [11], suggesting that
loss of merlin in schwannoma cells may lead to cellular hypertrophy as a result of elevated Rac
signaling.

Merlin also is known to play an important role in contact-dependent growth arrest [12,13].
Embryonic fibroblasts derived from Nf2-deficient mice continue to grow beyond confluency,
and their inability to form stable adherens junctions appears to be at least partially responsible
for this aberrant phenotype [13].

Although studies using primary schwannoma cells have yielded significant information, their
use also has significant drawbacks. Typical tumor specimens yield extremely low numbers of
cells, and the cells grow very slowly in culture. In addition, primary schwannoma cells are
refractory to gene transfection, making mechanistic studies difficult. Thus, the inherent
difficulties in obtaining, maintaining, and manipulating primary schwannoma cells led us to
evaluate the immortalized schwannoma cell line HEI-193 as an alternative cell system with
which to study merlin function.

The HEI-193 cell line was derived from an NF2 patient with spontaneous bilateral vestibular
schwannomas as well as a history of meningioma [14]. The schwannomas were surgically
removed and their constituent cells subsequently immortalized using the human papilloma
virus E6-E7 genes [15]. Previous work detected a germ-line mutation in the NF2 gene at
position −1 of the intron 14 / exon 15 border. This mutation is predicted to destroy the donor
sequence of exon 15 and result in exon skipping [16]. The presence of a shorter NF2 transcript
in HEI-193 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR [15]. However, the molecular alterations in the
NF2 transcript and the encoded merlin protein were not fully described.

In this paper we report that the merlin protein expressed in HEI-193 cells has amino acid
sequence identical to that of a splice variant previously designated as isoform 3 [17]. This
isoform was first described in a family with a history of a mild form of NF2 and was shown
to arise because of an A→T mutation within the NF2 gene at the +3 position of the donor site
of intron 15 [17]. Interestingly, isoforms 1, 2 and 3 are simultaneously and equivalently
expressed both at the RNA and protein levels in fibroblasts derived from this family, but in
schwannoma cells only isoform 3 is expressed [17]. Based on the mild nature of the NF2 disease
phenotype seen in this family, the authors of this study concluded that merlin isoform 3 retained
mild tumor suppressive activity.

Here we present evidence that HEI-193 cells express merlin isoform 3 with no detectable
isoform 1 or 2. The level of merlin isoform 3 in HEI-193 cells is comparable to levels of merlin
found in normal human Schwann cells and several immortalized cell lines, and merlin isoform
3 appears to be as stable as isoforms 1 and 2. Although the presence of merlin isoform 3 has
no apparent negative effect on the growth of HEI-193 cells, when exogenously expressed in
NF2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, isoform 3 suppresses growth, but much less effectively
than similarly expressed merlin isoform 1. Merlin isoform 3 also interacts readily with both
isoforms I and 2 in vitro and in vivo.

Genomic DNA isolation and PCR

Genomic DNA was isolated from U251 and HEI-193 cells using the DNeasy™ tissue kit from
Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Using Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity and 0.5 μg of
genomic DNA from either HEI-193 or U251 cells, a 525 bp fragment containing 153 bp of
intron 14, exon 15 (163 bp) and 209 bp of intron 15 was PCR-amplified with the primers
Mer_Ex15F (5′-AAGCTCCCATGGCCTGTG-3′) and Mer_Ex15R (5′-
ACAAGCTCAACTTCCATCCAG-3′). The amplification program was as follows: a
denaturation step at 94°C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of amplification (94°C for 30 sec,
55°C for 15 sec, 68°C for 1 min) and a final elongation step at 68°C for 10 min. PCR products
were cloned using the pCR®4-TOPO vector and TOPO TA cloning kit and sequenced at the
Genomics Core at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.

RNA isolation and RT-PCR

Confluent HEI-193 or U251 cells from a 10 cm plate were washed twice with ice cold PBS
(Ca2+/Mg2+ free). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol® Reagent according to manufacturer's
recommendations and resuspended in DEPC-treated water. RT-PCR using the SuperScript™
One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum® Taq was performed on 1 μg of total RNA. The full length
coding region of merlin was amplified using the primersMerFexonI (5′-
CATGGCCGGGGCCATCGCTTCC-3′) and MerR3′utr (5′-

(94°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, 68°C for 2 min) with a final elongation step at 68°C for 10
min. RT-PCR products were resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel followed by staining with ethidium
bromide. PCR products were cloned into the pCR®4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning
kit and sequenced.

Immunoblot Analysis and Inhibition of Ubiquitin-mediated Protein Degradation

Immunoblot detection was performed as described earlier [18]. Anti-merlin antibodies and
Cyclin D1 were diluted 1:1,000, anti-ezrin 1:4,000, anti-caveolin 1:5,000 and secondary
antibodies 1:10,000. All antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. To inhibit ubiquitin-
dependent protein degradation, the 26S proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was dissolved in DMSO
and added to cells at the concentrations and time points indicated. DMSO alone was used as a
vehicle control.

Dot Blot Analysis of Protein Levels

Serial dilutions of cell lysates and known amounts of purified recombinant merlin isoform 1
were spotted on nitrocellulose and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the anti-merlin
antibody A19 (Santa Cruz sc-331). Intensities of all spots were quantified using ImageQuant
(Molecular Dynamics) software. A standard curve was generated using spot intensities of
purified, bacterially expressed merlin, and the amount of merlin present in cell lysates was
estimated using the standard curve.

In Vitro Transcription/Translation

Plasmids (pcDNA3) encoding wild type merlin isoform 1 or 2 or FLAG-tagged isoform 3 were
transcribed and translated in vitro according to manufacturer's directions using the TNT® Quick
coupled transcription/translation system. For immunoprecipitation, 20 μl of TNT® mixture
containing merlin isoform 1 or 2 was combined with 20 μl of a control TNT® mixture in which
no DNA had been transcribed/translated or with 20 μl of a TNT® mixture containing FLAG-
merlin 3. After incubation on ice for 30 min, 5 μl were removed and mixed with 5 μl of 2X
SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled 5 min. To the remaining 35 μl of protein mixtures, 320
μl of 0.5% TX-100 in PBS were added along with 5 μl of anti-FLAG (M2) antibody and the
solution placed on ice for 30 min. Protein G-agarose slurry was added as described below and
the sample incubated overnight before washing agarose 3 times with 0.5% TX-100/PBS and
preparation for SDS-PAGE.

Immunoprecipitation

To immunoprecipitate FLAG epitope-tagged merlin, cell lysates were prepared using IP buffer
containing 50mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, 60 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor
cocktail. After 15 min lysis in 1 ml of IP buffer, insoluble material was pelleted for 15 min in
a microcentrifuge. The soluble supernatant was removed and 80 μl was mixed with 20 μl of
5X SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled 5 min. Five μl of anti-FLAG antibody was added to
the remainder of the lysate and the mix was placed on ice for 30 min. Next, 50 μl of Protein G
agarose slurry was added and the tubes placed on a rotator at 4°C for 4 h. The Protein G agarose
was pelleted and washed 3 times with IP buffer, then boiled for 5 min after resuspension in
200 μl of 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer.

Cell growth assay

The effect of recombinant adenoviral expression of merlin isoforms on the growth of merlin
mutant MEF3Δ2 cells was measured in 96-well plates by MTT assay. Five 96-well plates were
prepared with 2 × 103 cells per 100 μl per well, five wells per set, four sets per plate. Each plate
had one set of mock infected cells and three sets of cells infected cells with recombinant

adenovirus expressing merlin isoform 1, merlin isoform 3 or control GFP. Infections were
performed by adding to each well 10 μl of media containing 2 × 105 pfu virus for an m.o.i of
100:1. MTT assays were performed on one plate on day 0, day 1, day 2, days 3 and day 4.
Twenty μl of a 5 mg/ml solution of MTT in PBS was added per well, incubated for 1 h, the
media was then aspirated, the cells were solubilized in 100 μl of DMSO for 30 min and the
absorbance at 570 nm was measured on a Bio-Tek EL-311 Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek
Instruments, Winooski, VT).

Results
Confirmation of the NF2 mutation in HEI-193 cells

To evaluate HEI-193 cells as a model for studying merlin function, we carried out a thorough
investigation of the NF2 gene, transcript, and protein in HEI-193 cells. It has been reported
previously that the NF2 gene in HEI-193 cells possesses a point mutation at the border of intron
14 and exon 15 [15]. To confirm the presence of the previously described G→A mutation
within the NF2 gene (position 1571-1, Fig. 1 and Table 1), we amplified the intron 14/exon 15
region from HEI-193 genomic DNA by PCR and sequenced the product. The result confirmed
the presence of the transition mutation (Table 1). This mutation replaces the G that is present
in 100% of the −1 position of the intron/exon borders catalogued by Mount [16], preventing
recognition of this sequence as an intron/exon border. As a control, we sequenced the identical
region of the NF2 gene from U251 cells, a glioma cell line known to express full-length merlin
[19]. As expected, the NF2 gene from U251 cells did not possess this mutation (Table 1).

The predicted effect of this mutation in HEI-193 cells is a splicing error leading to skipping of
exon 15 during processing of the NF2 pre-mRNA, resulting in a shortened NF2 transcript
[15]. Our RT-PCR amplification of the open reading frame of the NF2 mRNA using HEI-193
and U251 total RNA as templates (Fig. 2) confirmed that such a transcript exists. As shown in
Fig. 2, the major NF2 transcript from U251 cells was 1.8 kb as predicted, whereas the full
length NF2 transcript from HEI-193 cells was slightly shorter, at 1.6 kb. The smaller transcripts
in both cell lines reflect other alternative splicing, especially of exons 2 and 3, which is
commonly observed in many cell types [4,6,20-22]

Full length, wild type merlin is a mixture of isoforms 1 and 2, themselves generated by
alternative splicing of the 3′ end of the NF2 transcript (Fig. 1). Previous data have suggested
that these isoforms are expressed at roughly equivalent levels, with isoform 2 being slightly
more prevalent [6]. These two forms can be distinguished from one another by RT-PCR
amplification of the NF2 transcript near the 3′ end of the open reading frame [23]. Using primers
designed to amplify the NF2 transcript from exon 13 to the 5′ end of exon 17 (Fig. 1), a 491
bp product was formed as the result of amplification of merlin isoform 1, whereas a 536 bp
product was formed from isoform 2 transcript due to the presence of the 45 bp exon 16 (Fig.
1). As expected, both products are present in U251 cells (Fig.2), indicating the presence of
merlin isoforms 1 and 2 in these cells. In contrast, when a similar reaction was performed using
HEI-193 RNA, a single band of approximately 330 bp was present.

Taken together, our data suggest that the NF2 mutation in HEI-193 results in a shortened
NF2 transcript due to a splicing error in the 3′ end of the NF2 mRNA. Additionally, alternative
splicing at the 3′-end of the NF2 mRNA is abolished in HEI-193 cells as evidenced by the
single RT-PCR product.

HEI-193 cells express a variant NF2 transcript termed isoform 3

To establish the identity of the major isoform of merlin expressed in HEI-193 cells, we
sequenced the RT-PCR products. Most clones obtained from HEI-193 mRNA possessed wild

type 5′ ends, with some clones lacking exons 2 and/or 3 (not shown). However, as predicted,
the 3′ end of NF2 transcript from HEI-193 cells consisted of a sole isoform lacking both exons
15 and 16 (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the predicted amino acid sequence of this form of merlin
corresponded exactly with that of a merlin isoform previously reported in an NF2 patient,
designated isoform 3 [17]. However, isoform 3b, a second transcript that lacks only exon 15,
detected in the same NF2 patient, was not detected in HEI-193 cells.

Levels of merlin isoform-3 protein in HEI-193 cells are not regulated by protein instability
Previous work has shown that mutant forms of merlin are more susceptible than their wild-
type counterpart to proteolytic degradation and this may account for the observation that mutant
merlin is rarely detectable in cells [24]. When we compared merlin levels in HEI-193 cells,
primary normal human Schwann cells and several immortalized cell lines including NIH3T3
and Cos-7, we found that HEI-193 cells express roughly equivalent level of merlin isoform 3
(Fig. 3a). To compare the stability of merlin isoform 3 with that of isoforms 1 or 2, we
transfected Cos-7 cells with cDNA encoding merlin isoforms 1, 2, or 3. Cos-7 cells are readily
amenable to transfection and have been used previously in studies testing the detergent
solubility and subcellular localization of overexpressed merlin [19,25]. Fig. 3b shows that,
when ectopically expressed in a heterologous cell line, merlin isoform 3 is as efficiently
expressed as isoform 1 or 2, suggesting that isoform 3 is not inherently unstable. When HEI-193
cells were transiently transfected with each isoform of merlin (Fig. 3b), there appeared to be
a low but detectable level of proteolytic degradation of all three isoforms, as suggested by the
presence of an additional, lower Mw, immunoreactive band in the immunoblot. Therefore,
while HEI-193 cells are capable of expressing high levels of merlin isoforms 1, 2 and 3, a low
degree of proteolysis affecting all isoforms cannot be ruled out.

Although these results suggest that merlin isoform 3 is as stable as isoforms 1 and 2, previous
data have shown mutant forms of merlin to be particularly susceptible to ubiquitin-mediated
degradation [24]. To test whether endogenous merlin isoform 3 was sensitive to ubiquitin
proteolysis, we treated HEI-193 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, which had been
shown previously to increase the half life of merlin [24]. When MG-132 was added at 5 or 50
μM for 7 or 26 h, cyclin D1 protein levels increased as expected for a protein that is efficiently
degraded by the 26S proteasome (Fig. 3c) indicating that the ubiquitin pathway is fully
functional in HEI-193 cells. However, treatment with MG-132 had no effect on either merlin
isoform 3 or ezrin levels in HEI-193 cells. These data supported the idea that the level of merlin
isoform 3 in HEI-193 cells is not regulated by a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic mechanism.

Merlin isoform 3 can interact with isoforms 1 and 2

We and others have shown previously that merlin isoforms 1 and 2 can directly bind to one
another [19,23] and that interactions amongst merlin isoforms can modulate merlin:ezrin
interactions in vivo [23]. Thus, it would be of interest to know whether merlin isoform 3 could
directly interact with isoforms 1 and 2. To address this question, untagged forms of merlin 1
and 2 and a FLAG epitope-tagged version of isoform 3 were produced using a coupled in
vitro transcription/translation system (TNT®). Untagged merlin 1 or 2 was then mixed with
control or FLAG-merlin 3 reactions and the lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation using
anti-FLAG antibodies. Subsequent immunoblot analysis using the polyclonal anti-merlin
antibody A19 (Fig. 4a) revealed that isoforms 1 and 2 could only be immunoprecipitated in
the presence of FLAG-merlin 3, indicating that merlin isoform 3 indeed interacted with wild
type isoforms (1 and 2) of merlin.

To test if the different merlin isoforms could interact in vivo, Cos-7 cells were transfected with
isoforms 1 or 2 alone or co-transfected with a FLAG epitope-tagged version of isoform 3.
Merlin isoform 3 complexes were isolated using anti-FLAG antibodies and the presence of all

expressed well and at similar levels and, as expected, no merlin isoform 1 or 2 protein was
immunoprecipitated in the absence of FLAG-merlin 3. However, when FLAG-merlin 3 was
co-transfected, isoforms 1 and 2 were readily detected in FLAG immunoprecipitates. These
results indicate that merlin isoform 3 is capable of forming in vivo complexes with isoforms 1

The alternative splicing at the 3′end of the wild type merlin gene leads to the replacement of
the 16 amino acid C-terminus of isoform 1 by a different 11 amino acid C-terminus for isoform
2 (Fig. 1). This difference is apparently sufficient to prevent isoform 2 from being growth
suppressive [7]. To determine whether merlin isoform 3 possesses growth suppressive activity,
mutant merlin MEF3Δ2 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing isoform
1, isoform 3 or a GFP expressing control and their effect on cell proliferation was measured
by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 5, cells infected with merlin isoform 1 grew at the same rate
as controls under subconfluent conditions on days 1 and 2 but had a reduced growth rate
coincident with confluence on days 3 and 4. This merlin-induced contact inhibition of growth
was not observed in uninfected and control GFP infected cells. In contrast, cells infected with
isoform 3 showed a somewhat reduced growth rate on days 3 and 4 but did not have the dramatic
reduction in growth that was apparent in cells infected by merlin isoform 1. We conclude that
merlin isoform 3 does not suppress cell growth as efficiently as isoform 1.

Discussion

The use of merlin-deficient cell and animal models has contributed significantly to our
understanding of merlin function. The importance of merlin to growth regulation and
development was convincingly demonstrated by the targeted disruption of the NF2 gene, which
resulted in embryonic lethality at day 6.5 in mice [26], whereas, Nf2 heterozygous mice develop
a variety of highly metastatic tumors [27]. Early studies using primary cultured merlin-deficient
schwannoma cells isolated from human tumors revealed distinct mutant phenotypic traits at
the cellular level, including cytoskeletal abnormalities [10,11] and growth characteristics
[28]. Unfortunately, such cells are very slow-growing and refractory to DNA transfection, thus
making biochemical and mechanistic studies difficult. The HEI-193 cell line, immortalized
from the schwannoma cells of an NF2 patient tumor, does not suffer from these disadvantages,
although until now, its characterization was incomplete. Our study addresses this shortcoming.

By sequencing the exon 15 region of the NF2 locus from HEI-193 cells, we confirmed the
previously reported G→A mutation at the −1 position of the intron 14/exon 15 border. Although
this mutation was predicted to promote skipping of exon 15, it was not expected to abolish
alternative splicing of exon 16 which would normally lead to isoforms 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). Thus,
it was surprising to discover that HEI-193 cells express a single NF2 mRNA consisting of
exons 1-14 followed by exon 17. Due to novel splicing, the amino acid sequence of this splice
variant is significantly shorter and differs completely from either isoform 1 or 2 near the C-
terminus. Unexpectedly, the amino acid sequence is identical to a merlin isoform described
previously in a family with mild NF2 and designated isoform 3 [17]. It is also interesting to
note that, unlike the mutation found in HEI-193 cells, the mutation reported by Sainio et al.
[17] is at the +3 position of the exon 15/intron 15 border (Table 1). At this time, how the two
disparate mutations result in the same mature transcript known as isoform 3 remains
unexplained.

As noted above, the merlin isoform 3 transcript has been previously described as arising in a
family with a very mild form of NF2 [17]. The mild manifestation of the disease in the affected
family led the authors of this study to conclude that isoform 3 retained some level of growth

suppressive activity. HEI-193 cells, which express isoform 3 exclusively, may provide the
optimal experimental system to determine the growth suppressive potential of this isoform.
Our cell proliferation experiments using Nf2-null MEFs infected with adenoviral vectors
encoding either merlin isoform 1 or isoform 3, provide a direct comparison between the growth
suppressive activity of the two merlin isoforms. They reveal that isoform 3 does not suppress
cell growth nearly as strongly as isoform 1 does, but it does retain a level of activity significantly
above baseline. These results provide experimental validation of the conclusion of the genetic
study of Sainio et al. [17] and are also consistent with the growth characteristics of HEI-193
cells. They also suggest that, although HEI-193 cells lack merlin isoforms 1 and 2, they are,
in reality, not a null model completely devoid of functional merlin protein.

We made two additional interesting observations in our characterization of merlin isoform 3.
First, the levels of merlin mRNA and protein in HEI-193 cells are equivalent to the levels of
merlin isoforms 1 and 2 in many other cell types, including normal human Schwann cells,
monkey Cos-7 cells, and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Second, we found that merlin isoform 3
is as stable as isoforms 1 and 2 when overexpressed in HEI-193 cells as well as Cos-7 cells,
suggesting that isoform 3 is not preferentially susceptible to degradation. In fact, isoform 3
protein does not appear to be susceptible to degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway,
as previously reported for several merlin mutants [24]. This suggests that isoform 3 can co-
exist with isoforms 1 and 2 in most cells, consistent with the notion that it can regulate the
function of isoforms 1 and 2.

In addition, our characterization of merlin isoform 3 and our in vivo and in vitro binding studies
revealed that merlin isoform 3 interacts with isoforms 1 and 2. This interaction may have
interesting functional implications in light of published evidence that merlin isoforms 1 and 2
can interact with one another [19,23] and that this interaction can compete effectively with the
interaction of isoform 1 with ezrin [23]. The idea that merlin isoforms can bind one another or
ERM proteins and thereby modulate their activity is also inherent in a study of the hierarchical
strengths of interaction among the N- and C-termini of merlin, ezrin and their binding partners
[29]. Thus, it is possible that merlin isoform 3 may be co-expressed with isoform 1 in some
cells, and the interaction of the two isoforms may act to attenuate the growth suppressive
activity of isoform 1, resulting in a mild form of the disease.

NF2 isoforms 1, 2 and 3 are diagrammatically represented and aligned with the NF2 gene to
show the contribution of the different exons to the resultant mRNA structure and protein
sequence. NF2 isoform 2 differs from isoform 1 by the addition of exon 16, resulting in the
substitution of the last 16 amino acids of isoform 1 with 11 different ones. Isoform 3 lacks both
exon 15 and 16, resulting in a protein C-terminus different from both merlin 1 and 2. The arrows
represent the relative positions of primers used for PCR and RT-PCR analysis. The open

Intron 14/Exon 15 border of the NF2 gene in HEI-193 cells
Intron 14 / Exon 15 border of HEI-193 NF2 gene.
Exon 15 of merlin was amplified using Genomic DNA isolated from HEI-193 and
U251 cells using intronic primers flanking exon 15 (Mer_15F and Mer_15R, Fig.
1). HEI-193 cells possess a transition from G to A at the −1 position of the intron
14 / exon 15 border, leading to the destruction of the splice acceptor site of exon
