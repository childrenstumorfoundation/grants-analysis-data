Abstract: We analyzed the histologic features of peripheral nerve
sheath tumors occurring in 14 patients with schwannoma-
tosis. Among a total of 31 tumors, 19 tumors (61%) showed
schwannoma-like nodules within a neuroÔ¨Åbroma-like tumor,
corresponding to hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbroma/schwannoma. At least
1 hybrid tumor occurred in 10 of 14 (71%) schwannomatosis
patients. We then retrieved cases of hybrid tumors without
documented relation to schwannomatosis from our database
and identiÔ¨Åed 41 tumors arising in 23 patients. More than half of
these patients (14/23) were reported to suÔ¨Äer from multiple
peripheral nerve sheath tumors, favoring a tumor syndrome.
Indeed, analysis of clinical records revealed the diagnosis of ne-
uroÔ¨Åbromatosis type 2 (NF2) in 26% (6/23), neuroÔ¨Åbromatosis
type 1 (NF1) in 9% (2/23), deÔ¨Ånite schwannomatosis in 4%
(1/23), and possible schwannomatosis in 13% (3/23) of patients
with multiple nerve sheath tumors. Our Ô¨Åndings suggest that
hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbroma/schwannoma represents a common tumor
type in schwannomatosis and shows a striking association with
neuroÔ¨Åbromatoses.

neuroÔ¨Åbromatosis type 2 (NF2, MIM 101000), and
schwannomatosis (MIM 162091), also called NF3. They
diÔ¨Äer not only by histologic features but also by distinct
molecular genetic events.5 In general, neuroÔ¨Åbromas orig-
inate from biallelic NF1 gene (17q11.2) mutations with loss
of neuroÔ¨Åbromin function, whereas schwannomas typically
harbor biallelic loss of the NF2 gene (22q12.2) function
leading to loss of merlin protein activity. In contrast to
schwannomas, neuroÔ¨Åbromas are complex, composed of
Ô¨Åbroblasts, perineurial cells, and Schwann cells. Mast cells
typically occur within the tumors.22 Although both are
benign, neuroÔ¨Åbromas and schwannomas have to be dis-
tinguished, because therapy, malignant potential, and as-
signment to tumor syndromes are diÔ¨Äerent. Occasionally,
hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas have been described,
deÔ¨Åned as nerve sheath tumors with schwannoma-like
nodules within a neuroÔ¨Åbroma-like tumor.10

More recently, schwannomatosis has been identiÔ¨Åed
as a separate tumor syndrome characterized by multiple
schwannomas arising from peripheral and cranial nerves
but sparing the vestibular nerve and lacking other signs of
NF2.3,18 More than 95% of cases are sporadic (non-
familial), whereas incomplete penetrance can cause diag-
nostic diÔ¨Éculties.1,19,20 Disease onset is usually in the
second and third decades, and pain is regarded as a major
symptom.11,20 Interestingly, in some familial schwanno-
matosis cases, multiple meningiomas have been described
akin to NF2.2,7 In NF2 patients, schwannomas occur
because of a second hit of the NF2 gene, such as NF2
mutations, loss of heterozygosity, or methylation. In con-
trast, schwannomatosis has been linked to mutations of
the SMARCB1 gene on chromosome 22q11.23 in some
families, although other genetic causes possibly entailing
increased susceptibility to mitotic recombination have been
suggested.2,4,12,13,16,29 A recent French study of schwan-
nomatosis patients revealed deleterious SMARCB1 germ-
line mutations in 5 sporadic cases out of 56 patients
investigated by genomic sequencing, thus demonstrating
only 9% of SMARCB1 mutations in this cohort.27 Other
studies showed involvement of SMARCB1 in about half
of the familial schwannomatosis cases.4,12 Interestingly,
germline SMARCB1 mutations in the setting of familial
and sporadic malignant rhabdoid tumors tend not to
occur together with schwannomatosis in aÔ¨Äected families,
except for very rare cases.9,32 In schwannomas and men-

ingiomas of schwannomatosis patients, a 4-hit mechanism
of gene inactivation of SMARCB1 and NF2 has been
suggested.2,4,7,12,29 Although occurrence of multiple schwan-
nomas was eponymous for the disease, neuroÔ¨Åbromas have
also been rarely described in schwannomatosis.26 Further
subtypes of nerve sheath tumors have not been reported
so far.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients

Thirty-one peripheral nerve sheath tumors of 14
schwannomatosis patients were reviewed histologically.
Schwannomatosis was diagnosed according to published
criteria.18 Hence, deÔ¨Ånite schwannomatosis was diagnosed
if patients were more than 30 years of age and 2 or more
nonintradermal schwannomas (at least 1 with histologic
conÔ¨Årmation and no evidence of vestibular tumor and no
NF2 constitutional mutation) or 1 pathologically conÔ¨Årmed
nonvestibular schwannoma plus a Ô¨Årst-degree relative who
meets the above criteria was identiÔ¨Åed. Accordingly, pos-
sible schwannomatosis was diagnosed as deÔ¨Åned.18

Furthermore, neuropathologic reports of the fol-
lowing institutions were screened for hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbroma/
schwannoma: Institute of Neuropathology, University
Hospital Mu¬® nster; Institute of Neuropathology, University
Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; and Institute of
Pathology and Neuropathology, University of Tu¬® bingen.
Data on sex, age (age at histologic diagnosis), localization,
and number of tumors were analyzed from clinical records.

Histologic Criteria

As diagnostic consensus criteria for hybrid neuro-
Ô¨Åbromas/schwannomas do not exist, we diagnosed a hy-
brid neuroÔ¨Åbroma/schwannoma when the following
features were fulÔ¨Ålled: intermingled areas with features of
both typical neuroÔ¨Åbroma [World Health Organization
(WHO) grade I] and typical schwannoma (WHO grade I)
must be observed within the same lesion (simple collision
is not accepted). NeuroÔ¨Åbroma diÔ¨Äerentiation should be
clearly diÔ¨Äerent from schwannoma Antoni B regions.

Immunohistochemistry

Sections were deparaÔ¨Énized, rehydrated, and wash-
ed. For antigen retrieval, slides were pretreated, cooled in
ice water for 15 minutes, and washed. Slides were blocked
with peroxidase blocking solution for 5 minutes and then
incubated with the following primary antibodies: mouse
monoclonal antineuroÔ¨Ålament (clone 2F11, 1:3000, Dako
Cytomation Denmark A/S), rabbit polyclonal anti-S100b
(1:4000, Dako Cytomation Denmark A/S), mouse mono-
clonal anti-BAF47 (Smarcb1/Ini1, 1:200, BD Biosciences),
rabbit polyclonal anti-Glut-1 (1:100, Immuno-Biological
Laboratories Co., Japan), rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP
(1:4000, Dako Cytomation Denmark A/S), mouse mono-
clonal anti-EMA (clone 29, 1:100, Dako Cytomation
Denmark A/S), mouse monoclonal anti-CD34 (1:80 Dako
Cytomation Denmark A/S), and mouse monoclonal anti-
Ki-67 (clone MIB1, 1:100, Dako Cytomation Denmark

A/S). Slides for EMA, Glut1, and CD34 staining were
pretreated at pH 6.1 and boiled. After washes, the slides
were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody,
streptavidin peroxidase, and diaminobenzidine (DAB) using
the Dako REAL Detection system (Dako REAL Detection
system, peroxidase/DAB+, Rabbit/Mouse, code K5001,
Dako Denmark A/S) for automated immunostaining.
Finally, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The
Ki-67 index was obtained by counting 1000 tumor cells
within the area exhibiting the highest labeling index. His-
tologic and immunohistologic stainings were evaluated by
3 neuropathologists (A.H., A.J., and W.P.).

RESULTS

Clinical Characterization and Tumor Spectrum

To characterize schwannomatosis-associated tumors,
a total of 31 peripheral nerve sheath tumors of 14
schwannomatosis patients were analyzed histopathologi-
cally. Among these tumors, 61% hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/
schwannomas (19/31), 26% schwannomas (8/31), and 13%
neuroÔ¨Åbromas (4/31) were identiÔ¨Åed (Table 1, Fig. 1A).
In all, 71% (10/14) of schwannomatosis patients showed at
least 1 hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbroma/schwannoma, and 3 schwan-
nomatosis patients (21%) contributed multiple hybrid
neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas (Fig. 1B).

We then retrieved cases of hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/
schwannomas with an unknown relationship to schwan-
nomatosis or other tumor syndromes from neuropathologic
records. We identiÔ¨Åed 41 hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwan-
nomas arising in 23 patients (Table 2). Clinical records were
retrospectively reviewed to identify multiplicity of tumors
and signs and symptoms for NF1, NF2, or schwannoma-
tosis. For 39% of patients (9/23) with a diagnosis of hybrid
neuroÔ¨Åbroma/schwannoma, additional clinical data could
not be retrieved at all. Remarkably, clinical records of more
than half (61%) of the 23 patients (14/23) reported multiple
peripheral nerve sheath tumors in terms of a tumor syn-
drome. Indeed, 26% (6/23) were diagnosed as NF2, 9%
(2/23) as NF1, 4% (1/23) as deÔ¨Ånite schwannomatosis,
and 13% (3/23) as possible schwannomatosis according to
established diagnostic criteria (Figs. 1C, D). Overall, 30%
of patients with hybrid tumors (7/23) presented not only
with multiple benign nerve sheath tumors but also with
multiple hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas (Table 2).
For example, patients 17 and 26 suÔ¨Äered from peripheral
nerve sheath tumors and from vestibular schwannomas and
meningiomas, thus fulÔ¨Ålling diagnostic criteria for NF2.
One patient (patient 25) presented with peripheral tumors
at diÔ¨Äerent locations, whereas other signs of NF1 and NF2
and mutations by a comprehensive analysis of NF1 and
NF2 were excluded. For this patient (patient 25) and for
patients 21 and 37, possible schwannomatosis was our
working diagnosis because of the absence of additional
NF1-associated or NF2-associated features. However,
clinical records were not absolutely suÔ¨Écient to ensure this,
as all
tumors represented only hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/
schwannomas histologically, and conventional schwanno-
mas were not seen histologically.

Overall, 60 hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas
were diagnosed in our series. The age of the patients
(n = 33) with hybrid tumors ranged between 15 and
70 years (median 42), and the male:female ratio was 1:0.9.
Hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas were localized
at the peripheral nerves, except for 1 case involving the
hypoglossal nerve. Major and minor superÔ¨Åcial peripheral
nerves were involved. Smaller peripheral nerves were far
more often aÔ¨Äected compared with spinal root nerves. Be-
sides the periphery, a preferred localization at certain nerves
or body regions was not seen. We did not see clear diÔ¨Äer-
ences from conventional neuroÔ¨Åbroma or schwannoma
with regard to gross pathology. In 7 patients with hybrid
neuroÔ¨Åbroma/schwannoma, follow-up data were available
and ranged between 1 and 23 years after operation. Four
patients survived for >10 years without malignancy, and
the longest survival without development of malignancy
was 23 years.

Histologic Characterization

According to our criteria, hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/
schwannomas consisted of 2 parts: one part being typi-
cal of neuroÔ¨Åbroma and another part being typical of
schwannoma. These 2 diÔ¨Äerent regions were present at a
variable degree (Fig. 2). Schwannoma-like nodules typi-
cally appeared as Antoni A regions. Occasionally, in larger
schwannoma-like nodules, Antoni B regions were addi-
tionally seen. In the neuroÔ¨Åbroma-like part there was often
abundant collagen and myxoid change, and tumor cells
showed a characteristic elongated and wavy appearance.
In the schwannoma-like part, elongated cells with typical

palisading were present (Fig. 2). Increased mitotic activity
was seen in only 1 case. Twenty-Ô¨Åve percent of hybrid
tumors (15/60) showed a plexiform growth pattern. Those
plexiform tumors contained the schwannoma-like areas in
the center of fascicles. In all cases the neuroÔ¨Åbroma tissue
surrounded the schwannoma-like nodules (eg, Fig. 2B),
although sometimes the schwannoma-like nodules became
larger and only a small rim of neuroÔ¨Åbromatous tissue was
encountered (eg, Fig. 2D). In general, the schwannoma-
like nodules were often sharply encapsulated by collagen
bundles from the surrounding neuroÔ¨Åbroma-like tissue
(eg, Fig. 2F). In some cases pronounced lymphocytic in-
Ô¨Åltrates were present, especially at the margin of the lesion.
Among the 60 hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas we
did not see histopathologic patterns indicating malignant
change such as cell crowding, general nuclear enlargement,
hyperchromasia, or increased mitotic activity, except for
1 tumor. This specimen showed a focal increase of mitotic
activity; thus, focal transformation to low-grade malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumor could not be excluded.

Immunohistochemistry was performed for neuroÔ¨Åla-
ment, S100b, Smarcb1/Ini1, EMA, Glut-1, GFAP, CD34,
and Ki67 (Figs. 2, 3). Half of the cases (50%) had detect-
able axonal structures by neuroÔ¨Ålament staining in the neu-
roÔ¨Åbroma part. Residual nerve Ô¨Åbers of peripheral nerves
were occasionally seen at the tumor border. The Ki-67
index ranged between 0.8% and 18.5%. Smarcb1/Ini1
expression was retained in all tumors. S100b staining con-
Ô¨Årmed the dense package of Schwann cells in the schwan-
nomatous component. Perineurial-like cells with Ô¨Ånely
elongated cell bodies were abundant in the neuroÔ¨Åbroma-like

part and in the tumor capsule (residual perineurium) as
shown with anti-Glut-1 antibody. Within the compact
schwannoma-like part, Glut-1 immunohistochemistry was
mainly negative, whereas in a few cases a mosaic pattern of
intermingled immunopositive and immunonegative cells was
seen. Staining for EMA largely corresponded to that for
Glut-1, although it was decreased in the neuroÔ¨Åbroma-like
part. Anti-CD34 staining was strikingly abundant in retic-
ular components such as in neuroÔ¨Åbroma-like parts and
in Antoni B regions of schwannoma-like areas but was
clearly absent from areas of densely packed (Antoni A)
schwannoma-like nodules. GFAP immunohistochemistry
was negative in most tumors, whereas some tumors revealed
clusters of GFAP-positive Schwann cells, both in the neuro-
Ô¨Åbroma-like and in the schwannoma-like part.

DISCUSSION

We analyzed the histologic features of peripheral
nerve sheath tumors occurring in 14 patients with deÔ¨Ånite
schwannomatosis. Patients with schwannomatosis, as di-
agnosed by established criteria, develop schwannomas at
peripheral and intracranial nerves excluding the ves-
tibular nerve, the latter being distinctive for NF2.18 Inte-
restingly, among 14 schwannomatosis patients we not
only diagnosed schwannomas, which are considered to
constitute the hallmark neoplasm in this disease, but also
neuroÔ¨Åbromas and a high percentage (61%) of hybrid

neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas. The high percentage of the
latter is remarkable as even neuroÔ¨Åbromas are not usually
regarded to be among schwannomatosis-associated tumors.
Nevertheless, only 2 cases with superÔ¨Åcial neuroÔ¨Åbromas
in the setting of schwannomatosis have been reported in
the literature.26 The occurrence of hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/
schwannomas therefore widens the spectrum of tumor
entities involved in schwannomatosis. As some of the pre-
viously diagnosed schwannomas of our schwannomatosis
patients were reclassiÔ¨Åed as hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbroma/schwan-
noma in this study, some questions arise: Is there another
schwannomatosis-like syndrome with multiple hybrid neuro-
Ô¨Åbromas/schwannomas for which deÔ¨Åned diagnostic criteria
do not exist? Do all schwannomas of diagnosed schwanno-
matosis patients need to be reevaluated histologically to cope
with diagnostic criteria as hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwanno-
mas are not part of any criteria? At least 2 cases of our series
with multiple hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas as the
only manifesting tumor support the Ô¨Årst hypothesis.

Hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas have already
been described in the literature (for review see Table 3),
even in other species.25 To characterize the clinicopatho-
logic features of hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbroma/schwannoma we
screened our neuropathologic records for hybrid tumors
and identiÔ¨Åed another 23 cases (contributing 41 tumors)
including patients with tumor syndromes (61%) such as
NF1, NF2, and deÔ¨Ånite and possible schwannomatosis. The
remaining patients (39%) were not further characterized;

thus, they could suÔ¨Äer from a tumor syndrome or could just
present
sporadic cases. Occurrence of hybrid neuro-
Ô¨Åbromas/schwannomas has already been reported in 1 NF1
and in 1 NF2 patient (Table 3). We hypothesize that oc-
currence of these tumors may be underestimated in part
because current WHO classiÔ¨Åcation requires these tumors
to be classiÔ¨Åed as schwannomas or as neuroÔ¨Åbromas.

Although several authors (Table 3) have described the
histopathologic features of single hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/
schwannomas, Feany and colleagues have reviewed the histo-
pathologic features of 9 hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas
in more detail and already pointed out that plexiform fea-
tures are common.8,10,17,23,30,34,35 As in the series of Feany
and colleagues, all tumors of our series showed distinct
regions with typical features of both neuroÔ¨Åbroma and
schwannoma. The neuroÔ¨Åbroma component with myxoid,
loose and wavy areas, elongated cells, comma-shaped
nuclei, and abundant collagen usually enclosed Antoni
A nodules, showing densely packed spindled Schwann
cells with nuclear palisading. In larger lesions, interspersed
Antoni B components were rarely seen within the schwan-

noma-like component, and in many cases the demarcation
of
the 2 components was sharp (Fig. 2). Immuno-
histochemical characterization was according to current
knowledge of neuroÔ¨Åbromas and schwannomas, such as
occurrence of perineurial-like cells in neuroÔ¨Åbromas and
CD34 positivity in neuroÔ¨Åbromas and in Antoni B regions
of schwannomas.6,24,33 The histologic pattern appears to be
characteristic in our series, and some cases reported as
hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas in the literature may
not fulÔ¨Åll these features and rather may correspond to
collision tumors of neuroÔ¨Åbromas and schwannomas.30,31
Schwannoma-like nodules in neuroÔ¨Åbromas appearing as
small schwannomas have already been reported in text-
books as especially arising in plexiform tumors.28 We
would like to emphasize that those tumors be referred to as
hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas to distinguish them
from neuroÔ¨Åbromas. Unequivocal pathologic diagnosis of
neuroÔ¨Åbroma versus schwannoma is needed for a Ô¨Ånal
diagnosis according to diagnostic criteria of NF1, NF2, or
schwannomatosis, especially in cases that lack other clinical
data. In those cases, identifying a hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbroma/

both parts (A). S100b staining showed dense package of Schwann cells in the schwannoma-like component (B). Elongated
perineurial cells in the neurofibroma-like region (asterisk) and residual perineurium at the tumor border were marked with anti-
Glut-1 antibody (C). Mosaic Glut-1 immunopositivity in the schwannoma-like part (D) was seen in several cases. Some tumors
revealed clusters of GFAP-positive Schwann cells, both in the neurofibroma-like and schwannoma-like parts (E). EMA-positive cells
were marked at the margin, consistent with residual perineurium, and sparsely within the neurofibroma-like part (F). Abundant
CD34 immunopositive cells were present in reticular components such as in neurofibroma-like parts but were absent from densely
packed schwannoma-like nodules. CD34-positive small vessels were also present (G).

schwannoma would make a diÔ¨Äerence in assignment to tu-
mor syndromes and thus would have diagnostic implications.
To conclude, we have described a large series of
60 hybrid neuroÔ¨Åbromas/schwannomas with a striking
accumulation in tumor syndromes such as NF2 and NF1,
especially in schwannomatosis. We emphasize that these
tumors be recognized as a separate entity of peripheral
nerve sheath tumors apart from schwannomas and neu-
roÔ¨Åbromas, as it has implications for the diagnosis of
NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis. As molecular genetic
events are still unknown, and the potential for malignant
transformation such as in plexiform neuroÔ¨Åbromas is
unidentiÔ¨Åed in hybrid tumors, further studies on this
special tumor entity are required.
