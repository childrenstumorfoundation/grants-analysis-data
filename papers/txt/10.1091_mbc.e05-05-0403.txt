All eukaryotic cells sense extracellular stimuli and activate intracellular signaling cascades via G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCR) and associated heterotrimeric G proteins. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae GPCR Gpr1 and associated G␣
subunit Gpa2 sense extracellular carbon sources (including glucose) to govern ﬁlamentous growth. In contrast to
conventional G␣subunits, Gpa2 forms an atypical G protein complex with the kelch repeat G␤mimic proteins Gpb1 and
Gpb2. Gpb1/2 negatively regulate cAMP signaling by inhibiting Gpa2 and an as yet unidentiﬁed target. Here we show
that Gpa2 requires lipid modiﬁcations of its N-terminus for membrane localization but association with the Gpr1 receptor
or Gpb1/2 subunits is dispensable for membrane targeting. Instead, Gpa2 promotes membrane localization of its
associated G␤ mimic subunit Gpb2. We also show that the Gpa2 N-terminus binds both to Gpb2 and to the C-terminal
tail of the Gpr1 receptor and that Gpb1/2 binding interferes with Gpr1 receptor coupling to Gpa2. Our studies invoke
novel mechanisms involving GPCR-G protein modules that may be conserved in multicellular eukaryotes.

INTRODUCTION
All eukaryotic cells deploy on their surface signaling mod-
ules composed of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and
heterotrimeric G proteins to sense extracellular cues. GPCRs
are conserved from yeasts to humans and constitute a family
of cell surface receptors that contain seven transmembrane
domains and sense myriad extracellular ligands including
nutrients, odorants, hormones and pheromones, and pho-
tons (Gilman, 1987; Strader et al., 1994; Lefkowitz, 2000;
Mombaerts, 2004). Heterotrimeric G proteins consist of ␣, ␤,
and ␥ subunits, in which the G␣ subunits are guanine nu-
cleotide binding proteins and the G␤␥subunits form a mem-
brane-tethered heterodimer (Bourne, 1997; Sprang, 1997;
Gautam et al., 1998; Schwindinger and Robishaw, 2001; Ca-
brera-Vera et al., 2003). Ligand binding triggers conforma-
tional changes in the GPCR that stimulate GDP-GTP ex-
change on G␣ and release of the G␤␥ dimer. Released G␣-
GTP, G␤␥, or both signal downstream effectors. GTP-to-
GDP hydrolysis (either intrinsic or RGS protein-stimulated)
induces reassociation of the G␣-GDP subunit with G␤␥,
extinguishing the signal (De Vries and Gist Farquhar, 1999;
Guan and Han, 1999; Ross and Wilkie, 2000).

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses 3 GPCRs
(Ste2, Ste3, and Gpr1) and 2 G␣ subunits (Gpa1 and Gpa2),
comprising two signaling modules: one that senses phero-
mones during mating and the other that senses nutrients
and controls ﬁlamentous growth (Lengeler et al., 2000; Ha-

rashima and Heitman, 2004). S. cerevisiae exists in two hap-
loid mating types, a and ␣, which communicate via mating
pheromones. a haploid cells express a pheromone and the
GPCR Ste2 to sense extracellular ␣ pheromone. ␣ haploid
cells express ␣ pheromone and the GPCR Ste3 that senses a
pheromone. In both cell types, Ste2 and Ste3 are coupled to
the G␣ subunit Gpa1, which forms a conventional heterotri-
meric G protein with the G␤␥ subunits Ste4/18. On phero-
mone binding to either receptor, GDP-GTP exchange occurs
on Gpa1 and the Ste4/18 G␤␥ complex dissociates. The
liberated Ste4/18 dimer activates the pheromone responsive
MAP kinase cascade culminating in mating (for reviews, see
Dohlman and Thorner, 2001; Dohlman, 2002; Schwartz and
Madhani, 2004).

In contrast to the pheromone GPCRs that are haploid- and
mating-type-speciﬁc, a distinct GPCR, Gpr1, is expressed in
both diploid and haploid cells. The Gpr1 receptor activates
cAMP-PKA signaling and governs diploid pseudohyphal
differentiation and haploid invasive growth via the coupled
G␣ subunit Gpa2 (for reviews, see Lengeler et al., 2000; Pan
et al., 2000; Gancedo, 2001; Harashima and Heitman 2004).
gpr1 and gpa2 mutants are defective in both pseudohyphal
growth and transient cAMP production in response to glu-
cose (Ku¨ bler et al., 1997; Lorenz and Heitman, 1997; Co-
lombo et al., 1998; Yun et al., 1998; Kraakman et al., 1999;
Lorenz et al., 2000; Rolland et al., 2000; Tamaki et al., 2000;
Lemaire et al., 2004). Recent studies provide evidence that
glucose and structurally related sugars serve as ligands for
the GPCR Gpr1 (Kraakman et al., 1999; Lorenz et al., 2000;
Rolland et al., 2000; Lemaire et al., 2004).

The yeast G␣ subunit Gpa2 shares 35–55% identity with
other fungal and mammalian G␣ subunits, and the pre-
dicted secondary structures are highly conserved between
Gpa2 and canonical G␣ subunits (Harashima and Heitman,

2004). Amino acid residues that confer dominant pheno-
types when mutated are also conserved. For instance, a
mutation of Gln300 to Leu (Q300L) in Gpa2 is analogous to
the Gi␣1 Q204L mutation that abolishes the intrinsic GTPase
activity and functions as an activated form of Gpa2 (Ha-
rashima and Heitman, 2002). A mutation of Gly299 to Ala
(Gpa2 G299A) is analogous to Gi␣1 G203A and G␣s G226A
that fail to undergo the GTP-induced conformational change
and thereby serves as a dominant negative allele and inter-
acts with Gpb1/2 and Gpr1 more strongly compared with
the wild-type Gpa2 (Lorenz and Heitman 1997; Harashima
and Heitman, 2002).

Nevertheless, Gpa2 does not form a heterotrimeric com-
plex with the known yeast G␤␥ subunits Ste4/18 (Lorenz et
al., 2000; Harashima and Heitman, 2002, 2004). Recent stud-
ies identiﬁed two novel Gpa2 associated proteins, the kelch
proteins Gpb1 and Gpb2, which are functionally redundant
and share ⬃35% identity (Harashima and Heitman, 2002;
Batlle et al., 2003). The kelch motif is known to mediate
protein-protein interactions (Adams et al., 2000). Gpb1 and
Gpb2 each contain seven kelch repeats, which share no
sequence homology with the seven WD40 repeats of canon-
ical G␤ subunits. The crystal structure of the kelch repeat
enzyme galactose oxidase reveals that the seven kelch re-
peats can adopt a seven-bladed ␤-propeller structure strik-
ingly similar to G␤subunits (Ito et al., 1991, 1994; Wall et al.,
1995; Lambright et al., 1996; Sondek et al., 1996; Adams et al.,
2000; Harashima and Heitman, 2002).

gpb1,2 mutants exhibit enhanced PKA phenotypes, includ-
ing increased ﬁlamentous growth, sensitivity to nitrogen
starvation and heat shock, reduced glycogen accumulation,
and reduced sporulation (Harashima and Heitman, 2002;
Batlle et al., 2003). The gpb1,2 mutant phenotypes are par-
tially alleviated by gpa2 mutations and abolished by muta-
tion of the TPK2 gene that encodes one of the three PKA
catalytic subunits. These genetic ﬁndings support a model in
which the kelch proteins Gpb1/2 negatively regulate the
cAMP signaling pathway by inhibiting Gpa2 and an uniden-
tiﬁed target that may be an upstream element of the PKA
pathway including adenylyl cyclase or its regulator Ras or
regulatory proteins of Ras (Harashima and Heitman, 2002).
In contrast to canonical G␣ subunits, G␣ Gpa2 has an
extended N-terminus (Figure 1). This region shares no ho-
mology with known G␣subunits, whereas the remainder of
Gpa2 shares ⬎60% identity with G␣ subunits in closely
related yeasts and ⬎40% identity with mammalian G␣ sub-
units. The N-terminal regions of G␣ subunits are known to
mediate membrane localization and physical interactions
with the cognate GPCR and G␤␥ dimer (Navon and Fung,
1987; Hamm et al., 1988; Journot et al., 1991; Lambright et al.,
1996; Wall et al., 1998; Yamaguchi et al., 2003; Herrmann et
al., 2004).

All G␣ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins bear N-
terminal lipid modiﬁcations (myristoylation and palmitoyl-
ation) necessary for membrane targeting (for reviews, see
Chen and Manning, 2001; Cabrera-Vera et al., 2003). Myris-
toylation involves the irreversible cotranslational addition of
a 14-carbon myristoyl group on glycine at the second posi-
tion in the consensus sequence MGXXXS and this occurs via
an amide linkage after proteolytic removal of the initiating
methionine (Johnson et al., 1994; Ashraﬁ et al., 1998; Farazi et
al., 2001). Palmitoylation occurs on all G␣ subunits with the
exception of G␣t (transducin) and involves posttranslational
attachment of a saturated 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate, via
thioester linkage to cysteine residue(s) near the N-terminus.
There is no palmitoylation consensus sequence, and palmi-
toylation is reversible and may be regulated. Both palmi-

toylation and myristoylation may play roles in addition to
membrane localization (Linder et al., 1991; Gallego et al.,
1992; Wedegaertner et al., 1993; Wilson and Bourne, 1995;
Wise et al., 1997; Morales et al., 1998; Evanko et al., 2000;
Fishburn et al., 2000).

S. cerevisiae serves as a powerful model to study GPCR-G
protein signaling (for reviews, see Jeansonne, 1994; Lengeler
et al., 2000; Dohlman and Thorner, 2001; Dohlman, 2002;
Harashima and Heitman, 2004). The G␣ subunit Gpa1 is
myristoylated at the Gly2 residue and palmitoylated at the
Cys3 residue (Song and Dohlman, 1996; Song et al., 1996).
Myristoylation is required for Gpa1 membrane targeting
and palmitoylation, yet not for interaction with G␤␥(Song et
al., 1996). On the other hand, a Gpa1 palmitoylation-site
mutant protein (Gpa1C3A) is still partially localized to the
plasma membrane, partially functional, and bound to G␤␥
(Song and Dohlman, 1996). The G␤␥ dimer, the associated
GPCR Ste2/3, or components of the Gpa1 mediated MAP
kinase cascade are not required for Gpa1 membrane local-
ization (Song and Dohlman, 1996), but the Ste4/18 G␤␥
dimer does promote receptor-Gpa1 coupling (Blumer and
Thorner, 1990).

The distinct G␣ subunit Gpa2 forms an unusual protein
complex with the atypical binding partner kelch G␤ mimics
Gpb1/2 and contains an extended N-terminus. Thus novel
regulatory mechanisms may direct Gpa2 to the plasma
membrane and enable Gpa2 to function as a molecular
switch. Here we show that Gpa2 shares similar characteris-
tics with Gpa1 involving lipid modiﬁcations and their func-
tion. Gpa2 interacting proteins are dispensable for Gpa2
membrane localization. However, unexpectedly, Gpa2 is re-
quired for membrane targeting of the kelch G␤mimic Gpb2,
in striking contrast to conventional heterotrimeric G pro-
teins. Furthermore, the kelch G␤ mimic proteins Gpb1/2
were found to interfere with Gpr1 receptor-G␣ Gpa2 cou-
pling.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains, Media, and Plasmids
Media and standard yeast experimental procedures were as described (Sher-
man, 1991). To express genes heterologously in yeast cells, an attenuated
ADH1 promoter and an ADH1 terminator from the yeast two-hybrid vector
pGBT9 were ampliﬁed by fusion PCR using primers, GCTTGCATGCAACT-
TCTTTT/CGACGGATCCCCGGGAATTCCATCTTTCAGGAGGCTTGCT
and AGCAAGCCTCCTGAAAGATGGAATTCCCGGGGATCCGTCG/
CGGCATGCCGGTAGAGGTGT, for the 1st round PCR and primers, GCTT-
GCATGCAACTTCTTTT/CGGCATGCCGGTAGAGGTGT for the second
round PCR. The resulting PCR products were blunted with T4 DNA poly-
merase and cloned into the 2␮ plasmid YEplac195 that was digested with
HindIII and EcoRI and then blunted with T4 DNA polymerase to create a
yeast expression vector pTH19 (URA3 2␮). pTH171 (LEU2 2␮), pTH172 (TRP1
2␮), and pTH173 (LYS5 2␮) are pTH19 derivatives. The nuclear localization
signal (NLS) derived from the SV40 T antigen (PPKKKRKVA) was used to
direct fusion proteins into the nucleus (Are´valo-Rodrı´guez and Heitman,
2005). pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-kanMX6 was used as the substrate for PCR to am-
plify GFP (Longtine et al., 1998). Plasmids and yeast strains used in this study
are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Details of plasmids and strains are available upon
request.

Pseudohyphal and Invasive Growth
Pseudohyphal and invasive growth assays were investigated as described
previously (Harashima and Heitman, 2002).

Microscopic Studies
If not speciﬁcally described in ﬁgure legends, growth conditions were as
follows. For protein localization study, cells were grown in synthetic minimal
media to stationary phase and examined for protein localization under a
ﬂuorescent microscope (Zeiss Axioskop2 plus, Thornwood, NY) or a confocal
microscope (Zeiss LSM 410).

Preparation of Crude Cell Extracts and
Immunoprecipitation
⬵
Total cell extracts from yeast cells that were grown to midlog phase (OD600
0.8) in synthetic dropout media were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES,
pH 7.6, 120 mM NaCl, 0.3% CHAPS, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 20 mM
␤-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na-orthovanadate, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, pro-
tease inhibitors (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA; cocktail IV), and 0.5 mM phenyl-
methylsulfonyl ﬂuoride) using a bead-beater. After centrifugation (25,000 ⫻ g,
20 min), crude extracts (2 mg) were mixed with anti-FLAG M2 afﬁnity gel
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to precipitate FLAG tagged proteins.

In Vivo Lipid Modiﬁcations
⫽ 0.6–0.7, collected,
Cells were grown in 10 ml of SD-Ura medium to OD600
and resuspended into 5 ml of fresh SD-Ura medium. After 10 min, cerulenin
was added at a ﬁnal concentration of 2 ␮g/ml, and cells were incubated for
an additional 15 min under the same conditions. Subsequently, [3H]myristic
acid or [3H]palmitic acid was added to the cultures at a ﬁnal concentration of
50 ␮Ci/ml for myristoylation analysis or 500 ␮Ci/ml for palmitoylation
analysis. After 3 h, cells were collected and washed once with H2O and twice
with phosphate-buffered saline. Preparation of crude cell extracts and immu-
noprecipitation of FLAG tagged proteins were performed as above. The
bound FLAG tagged proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE
sample buffer in the presence of ␤-mercaptoethanol for the myristoylation
analysis and in the absence of ␤-mercaptoethanol for the palmitoylation
analysis (Song and Dohlman, 1996). After SDS-PAGE, gels were ﬁxed in
H2O/2-propanol/acetic acid (65:25:10 vol/vol/vol) for 30 min and then
soaked at room temperature for 18 h either in 1 M hydroxylamine (pH 7.0) to
cleave thioester-linked fatty acids or 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) as a control. The
gels were ﬁxed again, treated with Amplify (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) for
30 min, dried, and then exposed to an x-ray ﬁlm (BioMax MS ﬁlm, Eastman
Kodak, Rochester, NY) with an intensifying screen (BioMax Transcreen LE,
Kodak) at ⫺80°C for 1–2 mo. Expression of the FLAG-tagged proteins was
veriﬁed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma).

cAMP Assay
cAMP assay was as described in Lorenz et al. (2000) with some modiﬁcations.
Brieﬂy, at the time points indicated, 0.5 ml of cell suspension was transferred
into a microfuge tube containing 0.5 ml of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid
and was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. To prepare intracellular
cAMP, cells were permeabilized by defrosting at 4°C overnight. Cell extracts
were neutralized by ether extraction and lyophilized. Intracellular cAMP
levels were determined by using a cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Amer-
sham).

RESULTS
G␣ Subunit Gpa2 Is Myristoylated and Palmitoylated
The G␣ protein Gpa2 is coupled to the GPCR Gpr1 and
signals to activate the downstream effector adenylyl cyclase

in response to glucose. Based on analogy to other GPCR-G␣
systems, we hypothesized that Gpa2 would be localized to
the cell membrane for function. To address this, Gpa2 was
fused to green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP). To avoid perturb-
ing protein localization or receptor coupling sequences typ-
ically linked to the amino and carboxy terminal regions of
G␣proteins (Figure 1A), GFP was fused between the ﬁrst 10
amino acids (1–10) of Gpa2 and the remainder of the protein
(amino acids 4–449) to produce a Gpa21–10-GFP-Gpa24 – 449
internal fusion protein. This Gpa2-GFP fusion protein was
functional based on its ability to complement the pseudohy-
phal defect of gpa2 mutant cells (unpublished data). As
shown in Figure 2A, the Gpa2-GFP fusion protein was lo-
calized to the cell membrane. A C-terminally GFP tagged
Gpa2 protein was nonfunctional (unpublished data), in ac-
cord with the known role of the G␣ C-terminal domain in
receptor coupling (Slessareva et al., 2003; Herrmann et al.,
2004).

To establish the minimal Gpa2 domain required for mem-
brane localization, the ﬁrst 10 (Gpa21–10), 20 (Gpa21–20), or 30
(Gpa21–30) amino acids of Gpa2 were fused to a GFP cassette
and expressed in vivo. All three C-terminally tagged Gpa2-
GFP proteins were localized to the plasma membrane (Fig-
ure 2A). Therefore, as few as the ﬁrst 10 amino acids of Gpa2
sufﬁce for plasma membrane targeting.

In conventional G␣ subunits, lipid modiﬁcations of the
N-terminus mediate membrane localization (Chen and Man-
ning, 2001). Myristoylation occurs at Gly2 in the myristoyl-
ation consensus sequence G2XXXS6 (Johnson et al., 1994).
Palmitoylation can occur at any cysteine residue near the
N-terminus. Gpa2 contains glycine and serine in the second
and sixth positions for myristoylation and cysteine at the
fourth position from the N-terminus. To examine whether
these sites are lipid modiﬁed, a Gpa21–20-GFP-FLAG protein
in which the ﬁrst 20 amino acids of Gpa2 were fused to a
GFP-FLAG cassette was expressed in yeast cells and as-
sessed for lipid modiﬁcations. Gpa21–20-GFP-FLAG variants
containing mutations in the potential lipid modiﬁcation sites
(G2A, C4A, or S6Y) were also analyzed.

As a positive control for lipid modiﬁcation experiments,
an equivalent Gpa11–20-GFP-FLAG protein was constructed,

which was derived from the Gpa1 G␣subunit coupled to the
Ste2/3 pheromone receptors (Figure 2B). Gpa1 is known to
be myristoylated at the second position on glycine (Gly2)
and palmitoylated on cysteine in the third position (Cys3)
(Song and Dohlman, 1996; Song et al., 1996). Gpa1 myris-
toylation is essential for membrane localization and function
and required for palmitoylation, and palmitoylation also
promotes membrane localization and function. In addition,
the ﬁrst 9 amino acids of Gpa1 sufﬁce for membrane local-
ization of a Gpa1-GST fusion protein (Gillen et al., 1998).

As shown in Figure 2B, the wild-type Gpa2 fusion protein
was myristoylated and the myristoylation site and myris-
toylation consensus sequence mutant proteins, Gpa2G2A and

Gpa2S6Y, were not, suggesting that Gpa2 is subject to my-
ristoylation at Gly2. Gpa2 was also palmitoylated and a
mutation in the putative palmitoylation site (Gpa2C4A) abol-
ished this modiﬁcation (Figure 2C). Therefore, Gpa2 is also
subject to palmitoylation at Cys4. We note that the Gpa2C4A
fusion protein exhibited a decreased level of myristoylation
compared with the wild-type protein. Interestingly, reduced
myristoylation was also observed with the Gpa1C3S mutant
(Song and Dohlman, 1996). These results are indicative of
either a sequence preference in the myristoylation consensus
sequence (G2XXXS6) or a role for palmitoylation in promot-
ing myristoylation or its maintenance.

Figure 1. N-terminal alpha helix of G␣subunits (␣N domain) is involved in receptor and G␤␥dimer coupling. (A) The ␣N domain provides
one of the binding interfaces between G␣ and G␤ and the receptor. This image shows a hypothetical model (PDB ﬁle 1BOK) for a GPCR-G
protein module (GPCR; Rhodopsin, PDB ﬁle 1F88, G protein; PDB ﬁle 1GOT). The ␣N domain of the G␣ subunit that is required for G␤
subunit and receptor coupling is shown (modiﬁed from Cabrera-Vera et al., 2003). (B) The predicted secondary structures of the conventional
rat G␣i subunit and the yeast G␣ Gpa2 protein based on PHD (Rost et al., 1993). Gpa2 shares 34% identity with the rat G␣i subunit and the
predicted secondary structure is highly conserved between the two, except for the extended Gpa2 N-terminus. Secondary structure
assignments were based on those of G␣t/␣I (Lambright et al., 1996). (C) An alignment of the amino acid sequence of the N-terminus of Gpa2
homologues from S. cerevisiae and the related yeasts C. glabrata and S. castellii. C. glabrata and S. castellii express homologues of the S. cerevisiae
GPCR Gpr1 and G␤ mimic Gpb1/2 proteins as well as a Gpa2 homologue, yet the N-termini of their Gpa2 homologues share no signiﬁcant
homology. Amino acids forming a potential alpha helix in the N-termini are indicated by red rectangles. Identical amino acids are marked
(*) and shaded in gray, and conserved amino acids are also indicated (F). The 100th amino acid (R) of Gpa2 is shown in red. The ␤1 and ␣1
domains assigned in Figure 1B are shown. Alignments were obtained using Clustal W (Thompson et al., 1994).

Similar to Gpa1, Gpa2 requires myristoylation for palmi-
toylation because the G2A and S6Y mutations, which abolish
myristoylation, also blocked palmitoylation. Consistent with
these results, the Gpa2-GFP-FLAG proteins bearing the G2A,
C4A, or S6Y mutations failed to localize to the plasma mem-
brane, and thus myristoylation and palmitoylation are re-
quired for Gpa2 plasma membrane localization (Figure 2A).

To address the physiological roles of these lipid modiﬁ-
cations, the G2A, C4A, and S6Y mutations were introduced
into the GPA2 gene and expressed in a ⌺1278b gpa2/gpa2
diploid or gpa2 haploid mutant strain. As shown in Figure 2,

D and E, the GPA2G2A myristoylation site mutant failed to
complement either the pseudohyphal or the invasive growth
defects. The GPA2S6Y and GPA2C4A myristoylation consen-
sus sequence or palmitoylation site mutants showed severe
defects in both assays. Furthermore, introduction of a dom-
inant active mutation (Q300L) that abolishes Gpa2 GTPase
activity failed to restore activity of the GPA2G2A mutant
protein (Gpa2G2A, Q300L, unpublished data). Thus, myris-
toylation and palmitoylation both play critical roles in Gpa2
membrane localization and signaling. Importantly, the un-
usual G␣ subunit Gpa2 shares common features with the

conventional G␣ subunit Gpa1 with respect to lipid modiﬁ-
cations and their physiological roles.

Gpa2 Binding Partners Are Not Required for Gpa2
Membrane Localization
In heterotrimeric G proteins, G␤␥ subunits can promote
membrane localization of their associated G␣ subunits.
Therefore, the localization of Gpa2 was examined in the
absence of Gpb1/2 or when Gpb1/2 were overexpressed. As
shown in Figure 3, A and B, Gpa2 membrane localization
was unchanged under both conditions. Furthermore, dele-
tion of other known Gpa2 associated proteins, namely the
GPCR Gpr1 or the G␥ subunit mimic Gpg1, or even the
elimination of multiple binding partners (Gpb1/2 and Gpr1
or Gpb1/2 and Gpg1), did not perturb Gpa2 plasma mem-
brane localization, suggesting these binding partners are not
required for membrane targeting (Figure 3A).

Because Gpa2 is a component of the glucose sensing
cAMP signaling pathway and the agonist induced redistri-
bution of G␣s has been reported in mammalian cells (We-
degaertner et al., 1996; Thiyagarajan et al., 2002), we exam-
ined if carbon source affects Gpa2 protein localization
(Figure 3C). Glucose serves as a ligand for Gpr1 (Yun et al.,

1998; Kraakman et al., 1999; Lorenz et al., 2000; Rolland et al.,
2000; Lemaire et al., 2004). Glucose, fructose, and galactose
are structurally related hexoses, yet galactose is not a ligand
for Gpr1 (Lorenz et al., 2000; Lemaire et al., 2004). Fructose is
controversial, although fructose can induce cAMP produc-
tion when added to glucose-starved cells (Yun et al., 1998;
Lemaire et al., 2004). Maltose and galactose induce ﬁlamen-
tous growth in a Gpr1-Gpa2-independent manner (Lorenz et
al., 2000). Ethanol and glycerol are structurally unrelated
nonfermentable carbon sources. As shown in Figure 3C,
Gpa2 was localized to the plasma membrane to the same
extent under all conditions tested. Therefore, the carbon
sources examined do not inﬂuence Gpa2 protein localization
and Gpa2 is localized to the cell membrane irrespective of
activity of the Gpr1-Gpa2 signaling pathway.

Kelch G␤ Mimic Gpb2 Is Recruited to the Plasma
Membrane by Gpa2
If the kelch proteins Gpb1/2 function as G␤ mimics, we
hypothesized that Gpb1/2 should also be membrane local-
ized. To examine protein localization, a functional GFP-
Gpb2 protein was expressed in gpa2⌬ cells (Figure 4). When
GFP-Gpb2 was expressed alone, Gpb2 was found to be

Figure 4. G␣ subunit Gpa2 recruits the kelch G␤ subunit mimic
Gpb2 to the plasma membrane. (A) A functional GFP-Gpb2 protein
(pTH84) was coexpressed with Gpa2 (pTH47), Gpa2G299A (pTH49),
Gpa2G2A (pTH62), or Gpa2G2A-NLS (pTH149) proteins in gpa2⌬
mutant cells (MLY212a/␣), and protein localization was investi-
gated by confocal (A) or direct ﬂuorescence microscopy (B). The
empty vector pTH19 (⫺) served as control. Nuclear localization was

extensively when coexpressed with the Gpa2G299A mutant
protein that is unable to undergo the GTP-induced confor-
mational change when compared with wild-type Gpa2 (Fig-
ure 4A). This ﬁnding is in accord with previous data show-
ing that Gpb2 binds to Gpa2 in vivo and preferentially
associates with Gpa2-GDP (Harashima and Heitman, 2002).
When GFP-Gpb2 was coexpressed with the nonfunctional
Gpa2G2A mutant that is no longer directed to the plasma
membrane, GFP-Gpb2 was no longer localized to the plasma
membrane (Figure 4). To exclude the possibility that the
observed Gpb2 membrane localization is an indirect second-
ary consequence due to overexpression of the functional
wild-type Gpa2 protein, GFP-Gpb2 was coexpressed with a
nuclear localization signal (NLS) containing Gpa2G2A mu-
tant protein (Gpa2G2A-NLS). Strikingly, Gpa2G2A-NLS now
misdirected Gpb2 to the nucleus (Figure 4B). Therefore, the
G␣ protein Gpa2 forms a stable complex with the kelch G␤
mimic protein Gpb2 and serves to recruit Gpb2 to the
plasma membrane. That Gpa2G2A-NLS directs Gpb2 to the
nucleus also demonstrates that lipid modiﬁcations are not
required for the Gpa2-Gpb2 interaction. This is consistent
with ﬁndings regarding interaction of the yeast G␣ subunit
Gpa1 and the mammalian G␣subunit G␣i with their respec-
tive G␤ subunits (Jones et al., 1990; Song et al., 1996).

Kelch G␤ Mimic Gpb2 and the C-terminal Tail of the
Gpr1 Receptor Bind to the N-terminal Region of Gpa2
In canonical G␣ subunits, an N-terminal alpha helix called
the ␣N domain provides a binding surface for the G␤ sub-
unit and the coupled receptor (Lambright et al., 1996; Wall et
al., 1998). Because the ␣N domain is less conserved among
G␣ subunits, we searched for any related alpha helical do-
main in the extended N-terminus of Gpa2 using the PHD
secondary structure prediction method (Rost and Sander,
1993). A sequence spanning amino acid residues 49–57 was
identiﬁed that is predicted to form an alpha helix, although
this region does not share any signiﬁcant identity with
known ␣N domains (Figure 1).

Figure 3. The G␣ subunit Gpa2 is localized to the plasma mem-
brane independent of its known binding partners. (A) Gpa2-GFP
protein (pTH80) was expressed in gpr1 (MLY232a/␣), gpg1
(THY224a/␣), gpb1,2 (THY212a/␣), gpb1,2 gpr1 (THY243a/␣), and
gpb1,2 gpg1 (THY246a/␣) mutant cells and protein localization was
analyzed. (B) Overexpression of the kelch G␤ mimic proteins
Gpb1/2 has no effect on Gpa2 membrane localization. The Gpa2-
GFP protein was coexpressed with Gpb1 (pTH26), Gpb2 (pTH27), or
both (pTH26 and pTH114) in wild-type cells (MLY97a/␣). (C) Mem-
brane localization of Gpa2 was not altered by carbon sources. gpa2
mutant cells (MLY132a/␣) expressing the Gpa2-GFP protein were
grown in synthetic media containing different carbon sources and

cytoplasmic. However, when GFP-Gpb2 was coexpressed
with either wild-type Gpa2 or a dominant negative Gpa2
(Gpa2G299A), GFP-Gpb2 was directed to the plasma mem-
brane (Figure 4). Confocal microscopic analysis revealed
that Gpb2 was localized to the plasma membrane more

Figure 5. N-terminus of G␣ Gpa2 is re-
quired for binding to the kelch protein Gpb2
and the GPCR Gpr1. A series of deletions
was created in the N-terminal region of
Gpa2G299A, and these deletion constructs
were coexpressed with the GFP-Gpb2 pro-
tein (pTH84) in gpa2⌬ cells (MLY212a/␣) or
with GFP-Gpr1C (pTH170) in wild-type cells
(S1338) to determine roles of the N-terminal
region of Gpa2 on interaction with Gpb2 and
the C-terminal tail of Gpr1. Deletion mutant
Gpa2G299A proteins constructed and results
are shown schematically. ⌬1–14, ⌬1–29, ⌬1–
44, and ⌬1–100 mutant proteins were fused
to the ﬁrst 10 amino acids from the yeast G␣
subunit Gpa1 to restore targeting to the

plays an important role in Gpb2 binding (Figure 5). How-
ever, the ﬁrst 15 or 30 amino acids were not sufﬁcient for
Gpb2 binding because neither the Gpa2 ⌬16–84 nor the
⌬31–84 mutant was able to recruit Gpb2 to the plasma
membrane. On the other hand, membrane localization of
GFP-Gpb2 was observed when it was coexpressed with the
Gpa2 ⌬46–84 and ⌬46–100 mutants. Taken together, these
ﬁndings indicate that the ﬁrst 45 amino acids are necessary
for Gpb2 interaction. This N-terminal region alone (1–45 aa)
was not sufﬁcient because GFP-Gpb2 was cytoplasmic with
the Gpa2⌬46 – 449 variant. Structural analyses have revealed
that G␤ binding interfaces are present not only in the N-
terminus (the ␣N domain) but also in the central region (␤2
to ␣2 domain) of conventional G␣ molecules (Figure 1 and
Lambright et al., 1996; Wall et al., 1998). Therefore, by anal-
ogy Gpa2 may also require the corresponding internal con-
served region in conjunction with the N-terminal 1–45 aa to
bind Gpb2, although we cannot exclude a possibility that the
Gpa2⌬46 – 449 variant failed to recruit Gpb2 to the plasma
membrane because of instability. Note that the deletions
examined were also introduced into a wild-type Gpa2 con-
struct and tested for GFP-Gpb2 interaction as above, and
results were essentially equivalent to the ones with the
Gpa2G299A deletion variants with the minor difference that
plasma membrane localization of GFP-Gpb2 was weaker
when the wild-type Gpa2 deletion variant were coex-
pressed. This is consistent with the fact that Gpa2G299A binds
to Gpb2 more strongly than does wild-type Gpa2 (Figure 4,
Harashima and Heitman, 2002, 2004).

We next addressed regions of the Gpa2 molecule involved
in association with the Gpr1 receptor. Previously, the Gpr1
C-terminal tail composed of 99 amino acids was isolated in
a yeast two-hybrid screen that identiﬁed Gpa2 interacting
proteins (Xue et al., 1998). Because Gpr1 that is C-terminally

pressed with the GFP-Gpb2 protein to test for protein local-
ization. As noted above, Gpa2G299A recruits GFP-Gpb2 to
the plasma membrane (Figure 5). Similarly, Gpa2⌬␣ (51–57)
also brought GFP-Gpb2 to the plasma membrane (Figure 5).
Therefore, the sequence spanning amino acids 51–57, which
is predicted to be an N-terminal alpha helical region, is not
required for Gpa2-Gpb2 binding.

We next addressed whether other sequences in the Gpa2
N-terminal extension are required for Gpb2 interaction. For
this purpose, deletions were introduced into the N-terminal
region of the GPA2G299A allele to create ⌬1–14, ⌬1–29, ⌬1–44,
and ⌬1–100 derivatives of Gpa2G299A, which were also then
fused to the ﬁrst 10 amino acids from the S. cerevisiae G␣
subunit Gpa1 that are sufﬁcient for membrane localization
(unpublished data; Gillen et al., 1998). Internal deletions
were also created (⌬16–84, ⌬31–84, ⌬46–84, and ⌬46–100,
Figure 5). This deletion mutant series was coexpressed with
GFP-Gpb2 to examine which Gpa2 mutants are capable of
recruiting GFP-Gpb2 to the plasma membrane (Figure 5). All
deletions generated for this study (except for the ⌬46–449
Gpa2 mutant) are predicted to have no signiﬁcant impact on
the secondary structure of Gpa2, based on PHD analysis,
and the function and expression of
these alleles of
GPA2G299A were conﬁrmed by introducing these alleles into
wild-type diploid cells and examining pseudohyphal
growth (unpublished data). All deletion constructs and rep-
resentative results are shown in Figure 5.

GFP-Gpb2 did not associate with the plasma membrane
when coexpressed with the ⌬1–14, ⌬1–29, ⌬1–44, or ⌬1–100
Gpa2 derivatives, indicating that the N-terminus of Gpa2

tagged with GFP is nonfunctional (unpublished data), likely
because of interference with Gpr1-Gpa2 coupling, we fused
GFP to the N-terminus of the 99 amino acid soluble C-
terminal tail of Gpr1. The resulting GFP fusion protein (GFP-
Gpr1C) was coexpressed with the Gpa2G299A variants to
examine roles of the N-terminal extension on interactions
with the coupled receptor Gpr1, as above (Figure 5, also see
Figure 8).

As shown in Figure 5, any variant of Gpa2 lacking the ﬁrst
15 amino acids failed to recruit GFP-Gpr1C to the plasma
membrane (Gpa2⌬1–14, Gpa2⌬1–29, Gpa2⌬1– 44, and Gpa2⌬1–100),
whereas all of the variants containing amino acids 1–15
(Gpa2⌬16 – 84, Gpa2⌬31– 84, Gpa2⌬46 – 84, and Gpa2⌬46 –100) re-
cruited GFP-Gpr1C, similar to full length Gpa2G299A. The
only exception was Gpa2⌬46 – 449, which failed to recruit the
GFP-Gpr1C to the plasma membrane. These observations
indicate that the N-terminal region of Gpa2 participates in
associating with the receptor C-terminal tail, but that C-
terminal regions of Gpa2 likely also participate. Importantly,
the C-terminal tail of other G␣ subunits is known to be
involved in receptor coupling (Slessareva et al., 2003; Herr-
mann et al., 2004). Consistent with this model, Gpa2⌬1–100
still interacted with the C-terminal tail of Gpr1 in the yeast
two-hybrid assay and Gpa2 function was perturbed by a
C-terminal GFP tag (unpublished data). In summary, these
data indicate that both the N-terminal and more C-terminal
regions of the G␣ protein Gpa2 are required for interactions
with both Gpb2 and Gpr1.

Functional Roles of the Gpa2 N-terminus
To address roles of the Gpa2 amino terminus, N-terminal
deletions were introduced into wild-type Gpa2. The result-
ing deletion alleles were expressed in diploid or haploid
gpa2 mutant cells to examine whether these mutants com-
plement gpa2 defects in pseudohyphal growth,
invasive
growth, and glucose-induced cAMP production (Figure 6).
These mutant alleles were also introduced into diploid gpr1
gpa2 mutant cells to examine whether they require Gpr1 for
function or act as dominant alleles that bypass the receptor.
Cells expressing Gpa2⌬1–100 exhibited reduced pseudohy-
phal and invasive growth and reduced levels of basal and
glucose-induced cAMP, indicating that the N-terminal re-
gion plays an important functional role or that deletion of
the 1–100 amino acids might result in misfolding of Gpa2
(Figures 6). Gpa2⌬46 – 84, Gpa2⌬46 –100, and Gpa2⌬␣ (51–57) all
functioned as wild-type Gpa2, likely because Gpb2 and the
C-terminal tail of Gpr1 still bind to these deletion proteins
(Figure 6 and unpublished data). The ⌬1–14, ⌬1–29, ⌬1–44,
⌬16–84, or ⌬31–84 GPA2 mutant genes were largely able to
complement gpa2 mutant phenotypes. One interpretation of
these results is that these deletion proteins still functionally
interact with Gpr1 and Gpb2 via other Gpa2 domains and
are capable of functioning, similar to wild-type Gpa2. Or
expression of the deletion Gpa2 proteins from a multicopy
plasmid might mask their reduced activity so that expres-
sion from a low copy plasmid could elicit altered mutant
phenotypes. Alternatively, these results could be due to
counterbalancing defects in Gpa2 interaction with Gpr1 and
Gpb2 because Gpr1/Gpa2 and Gpb2 control the cAMP sig-
naling pathway positively and negatively, respectively (see
Discussion).

Kelch G␤ Mimic Proteins Gpb1/2 Function on the Plasma
Membrane
Gpb2 is directed to the plasma membrane in a Gpa2 depen-
dent manner, indicating that the kelch G␤ mimic proteins
Gpb1/2 may function on the plasma membrane. To examine

Novel Heteromeric G Protein Signaling

this hypothesis, the ﬁrst 10 amino acids of Gpa2 (hereafter,
the membrane localization sequence [MLS]) that sufﬁce for
membrane localization were fused to the N-terminus of the
GFP-Gpb1 or GFP-Gpb2 protein. The resulting fusion pro-
teins were tested for protein localization and complemen-
tation of the elevated ﬁlamentous phenotype of gpb1,2
mutant cells (Figure 7). We also tested the effects of fusing
a nuclear localization signal (NLS) from the SV40 T anti-
gen to the N-terminus of the GFP-Gpb1 or GFP-Gpb2
protein (Figure 7).

The MLS- and NLS-fused GFP-Gpb1/2 proteins were pre-
dominantly localized to the plasma membrane and the nu-
cleus, respectively (Figure 7A). Furthermore, the MLS-GFP-
Gpb1/2 fusion proteins complemented the gpb1,2 double
mutant phenotype and restored wild-type pseudohyphal
growth (Figure 7B).
the nuclear localized
Gpb1/2 proteins (NLS-GFP-Gpb1/2) were nonfunctional
(Figure 7B). These ﬁndings provide evidence that Gpb1/2
can function when heterologously targeted to the plasma
membrane. These results also indicate that the as yet un-
identiﬁed second target of Gpb1/2 might be membrane
associated.

In contrast,

Kelch G␤ Mimic Proteins Gpb1/2 Inhibit Gpr1-Gpa2
Coupling
Gpa2 interacts with the C-terminal tail of the Gpr1 receptor
and recruits the GFP-Gpr1 C-tail fusion protein to the
plasma membrane. Here we used this assay to analyze
Gpr1-Gpa2 coupling in further detail. GFP-Gpr1C is local-
ized to the plasma membrane when coexpressed with the
dominant negative Gpa2G299A allele. Additionally, mem-
brane localization of GFP-Gpr1C was less pronounced when
coexpressed with wild-type Gpa2, suggesting that the C-
terminal tail of Gpr1 binds more strongly to Gpa2G299A
compared to wild-type Gpa2 (Figure 8). On the other hand,
interaction of Gpa2 with the C-terminal tail of Gpr1 was
reduced even further with the dominant Gpa2Q300L allele
(Figure 8). This is consistent with the widely accepted model
in which the G␣-GDP complex binds to the cognate GPCR,
whereas the G␣-GTP complex dissociates from the GPCR.
To conﬁrm the interaction between GFP-Gpr1C and Gpa2,
the nonfunctional nuclear localized Gpa2G2A-NLS was co-
expressed with GFP-Gpr1C. In this case, GFP-Gpr1C was
now misdirected to the nucleus (Figure 8).

Because Gpb2 is directed to the plasma membrane in a
Gpa2-dependent manner and binds to the N-terminus of
Gpa2 where the C-terminal tail of Gpr1 also binds, we
hypothesized that Gpb1/2 could negatively regulate Gpa2
function by inhibiting the Gpr1-Gpa2 interaction. To address
this hypothesis, the wild-type Gpb1/2 proteins were simul-
taneously coexpressed with the GFP-Gpr1C and Gpa2G299A
proteins. As shown in Figure 8, the membrane localization of
GFP-Gpr1 was signiﬁcantly reduced by coexpression of
Gpb1/2, indicating that Gpb1/2 compete with the C-termi-
nal tail of Gpr1 for binding to the N-terminus of Gpa2.
Gpb1/2 may thereby control Gpa2 function by impairing
receptor coupling. This is in contrast to canonical G␤ sub-
units, which function to promote interactions of the G␣
subunit with the associated GPCR.

ation site. On the other hand, no obvious consensus se-
quence is established for palmitoylation, yet palmitoylation
mostly occurs in a cysteine residue(s) near the N-terminus.
The G␣ subunit Gpa2 contains the MG2XXXS6 myristoyl-
ation consensus sequence and a cysteine at the fourth posi-
tion of its N-terminus. A cysteine after the N-terminal cys-
teine appears at the 189th position of the Gpa2 protein. Our
biochemical studies revealed that Gpa2 is myristoylated and
palmitoylated. Furthermore, the labeling and site-directed
mutagenesis studies shown in Figure 2 provide evidence
that Gpa2 is myristoylated at Gly2 and, most likely, also
palmitoylated at Cys4.

Introduction of site-speciﬁc mutations (G2A, C4A, and
S6Y) into the GPA2 and GPA2-GFP fusion genes demon-
strates that myristoylation and palmitoylation are critical for
plasma membrane targeting and function of Gpa2. Although
it still remains to be established why myristoylation is es-
sential for G␣ function, recent studies demonstrate that
GPCR-G␣ fusion proteins, in which G␣ is localized to the
plasma membrane yet no longer lipid modiﬁed, are func-
tional in vivo (for review, see Seifert et al., 1999). Further-
more, a nonmyristoylated G␣i2Q205L protein is unable to
signal and fails to transform rat ﬁbroblasts (Gallego et al.,
1992). Consistently, we also found that a nonmyristoylated

tors. Structural and biochemical studies implicate the N-
terminal alpha helix (␣N domain)
in G␤␥ dimer and
receptor coupling (Lambright et al., 1996; Wall et al., 1998).
Gpa2 contains an alpha helix in the extended N-terminus,
yet the position of this helix is not conserved (Figure 1).
More strikingly, the alpha helix is not involved in coupling
to the kelch subunit Gpb2 or to the Gpr1 C-terminal tail.
Studies using Gpa2 variants that carry a series of deletions in
the Gpa2 N-terminus identiﬁed binding domains for the
Gpr1 C-terminal tail and Gpb2 that map to amino acids 1–15
and 1–45 and are not predicted to form an alpha helix.

Lipid modiﬁcations alone are not sufﬁcient to restore these
interactions as the Gpa2 ⌬1–14 mutant that is lipid modiﬁed
on an appended Gpa11–10 peptide did not direct the binding
partners to the plasma membrane. Rather, amino acid se-
quences that lie between residues 1–45 are important for the
interactions. Interestingly, the non-alpha helical N-terminus
(spanning amino acids 1–6) of G␣q is known to be involved
in receptor selectivity (Kostenis et al., 1997). Therefore, the
N-terminus may play a direct role in receptor coupling by
providing a binding interface or an indirect role by inﬂu-
encing overall structure. Either possibility is novel and fur-
ther studies, especially structural studies, should address
the role of the N-terminus of Gpa2.

The Role of the Gpr1 C-terminal Tail
Previous studies suggest the presence of preactivation com-
plexes in which an unoccupied, inactive GPCR is coupled to
the G␣subunit (Samama et al., 1993; Stefan et al., 1998; Dosil
et al., 2000). Such preactivation complexes are not necessarily
required for formation of the activated ternary complex in
which a ligand bound, activated receptor forms a complex
with a G protein to stimulate GDP-GTP exchange on G␣, yet
the preactivation complexes are involved in regulation of
speciﬁcity and intensity of G-protein mediated signaling
(Neubig, 1994; Shea and Linderman, 1997). In S. cerevisiae,
the C-terminal tail of the ␣-factor receptor Ste2 is implicated
in the formation of the preactivation complex with its asso-
ciated G␣ Gpa1 (Dosil et al., 2000). Although no direct evi-
dence has been reported for a preactivation complex be-
tween the Gpr1 receptor and Gpa2, our data support the
existence of one. First, the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of
Gpr1 binds to wild-type Gpa2 and a nuclear localized
Gpa2G2A-NLS. Second, Gpr1 and Gpa2 are still functional in
the absence of the G␤ mimic subunits Gpb1/2, suggesting a
promiscuous coupling between Gpr1 and Gpa2.

These observations may be relevant to our ﬁnding that
N-terminal deletion variants of Gpa2 (⌬1–14, ⌬1–29, ⌬1–44,
and ⌬1–100) that are unable to bind to the Gpr1 C-terminal
tail are still functional and can respond to glucose to stim-
ulate cAMP production. This interpretation may also ex-
plain why cells expressing these Gpa2 variants exhibited
near wild-type phenotypes. It is conceivable that a reduced
afﬁnity of the Gpa2 variants with the Gpr1 receptor could
result in a decrease in signaling leading to a low-PKA phe-
notype. However, these Gpa2 variants also show decreased
binding to the kelch subunits Gpb1/2 that negatively control
cAMP signaling, affecting Gpb1/2 function to activate the as
yet unidentiﬁed second target that inhibits cAMP signaling.

Kelch Subunits Gpb1/2 Inhibit Gpr1-Gpa2 Coupling
G-protein activity is controlled at multiple steps including
expression, protein localization, GDP-GTP exchange, and
GTPase activity. GPCRs activate G proteins by stimulating
GDP dissociation from G␣and acting as guanine nucleotide
exchange factors, thereby leading to G␣ in the active G␣-
GTP form. On the other hand, the GoLoco family protein

membrane. A membrane localization sequence (MLS) or nuclear
localization signal (NLS) was fused to the N-terminus of the func-
tional GFP-Gpb1/2 proteins (pTH106/pTH75) and the resulting
fusion proteins (pTH163, pTH164, pTH166, or pTH167) were ex-
pressed in diploid gpb1,2 double mutant cells (THY212a/␣) to test
for protein localization (A) and function (B). The MLS-GFP-Gpb1/2
fusion proteins were recruited to the plasma membrane and were as
functional as the wild-type Gpb1/2 proteins, whereas the NLS-GFP-
Gpb1/2 fusion proteins were directed to the nucleus and nonfunc-
tional. Cells bearing the empty vector (pTH19) or the GPB1 (pTH26)

dominant Gpa2Q300L mutant (equivalent to G␣i2 Q205L) is
incapable of enhancing ﬁlamentous growth in wild-type
cells. These ﬁndings support a model in which lipid modi-
ﬁcations are necessary for plasma membrane targeting that
is a prerequisite for G␣ function. Alternatively, myristoyl-
ation may play an important role in G␣ structure that is
required for receptor coupling (Preininger et al., 2003).

In heterotrimeric G proteins, the N-terminus is also in-
volved in interactions with G␤␥ dimer, receptors, and effec-

fusion protein (pTH170) was expressed alone or coexpressed with Gpa2 variants, wild-type Gpa2 (pTH47), Gpa2Q300L (pTH48), Gpa2G299A
(pTH49), or NLS-Gpa2G2A (pTH149) with or without Gpb1/2 (pTH174/pTH114) in wild-type cells (THY452). Empty vectors (pTH171 and
pTH173) were used as controls for the Gpb1/2 plasmids, pTH174 and pTH114. The location of nuclei were conﬁrmed by DAPI staining.

AGS3 functions as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhib-
itor (GDI) by inhibiting GDP-GTP exchange (De Vries et al.,
2000). Although GoLoco homologues are conserved in mul-
ticellular eukaryotes, no such homolog is apparent in the
yeast genome.

Our previous studies revealed that the kelch subunits
Gpb1 and Gpb2 negatively control Gpa2 and preferentially
associate with Gpa2-GDP (Harashima and Heitman, 2002).
However, neither loss nor overexpression of Gpb1/2 per-
turbed Gpa2 membrane localization or expression. In addi-
tion, Gpb1/2 did not exhibit GDI activity under standard in
vitro conditions (unpublished data). Here we show that

Gpb1/2 inhibit Gpa2-Gpr1 coupling. A model governing
how the kelch Gpb1/2 subunits control Gpa2 is that Gpb1/2
bind to the Gpa2 N-terminal region spanning amino acids
1–45 and occlude binding of the Gpr1 C-terminal tail to the
ﬁrst ﬁfteen amino acids of Gpa2 (Figure 9).

In canonical heterotrimeric G proteins, G␤␥ subunits are
required for receptor-G␣ coupling. In S. cerevisiae, the G␤␥
dimer plays an essential role in pheromone receptor-G␣
Gpa1 coupling (Blumer and Thorner, 1990). In mammalian
systems, a role for the G␤␥ subunits in coupling of ␤

ceptor-G␣i has been established (Richardson and Robishaw,
1999; Hou et al., 2001; Lim et al., 2001; Ku¨ hn et al., 2002). This
function is opposite to the role of the kelch subunits, yet
importantly, yeast and mammalian WD40 repeat G␤␥ sub-
units and the kelch subunits all converge to modulate recep-
tor-G␣ coupling. That receptor-G␣ coupling is oppositely
regulated may depend on how tightly and speciﬁcally a
given G␣ binds to its associated receptor. In yeast, the pher-
omone receptor Ste2 is functionally coupled to the G␣ pro-
tein Gpa1 and not to the Gpa2 G␣ subunit (Blumer and
Thorner, 1990). During diploid ﬁlamentation, the glucose
receptor Gpr1 is associated with Gpa2 and not with the
haploid speciﬁc G␣Gpa1. Importantly, the Gpa2 G␣subunit
is still partially functional and able to signal in response to
the agonist glucose via Gpr1 in the absence of Gpb1/2,
suggesting that Gpa2 can functionally couple to its receptor
in the absence of Gpb1/2 (Harashima and Heitman, 2002).
Therefore, Gpa2 may normally be tightly associated with the
Gpr1 receptor, and Gpb1/2 function to compete with this
association to reduce signaling in the absence of glucose.

Generally, the intracellular third loop of GPCRs plays a
crucial role in interactions with the G␣subunit. Although S.
cerevisiae Gpa2 has been reported to interact with the intra-
cellular third loop of Gpr1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay
(Yun et al., 1997), we were unable to recapitulate this result
(unpublished data). This could be attributable to a weak
interaction between Gpa2 and the third loop of Gpr1. In
contrast, the Gpr1 C-terminal tail avidly binds to Gpa2 in
two-hybrid assays (Yun et al., 1997; Xue et al., 1998; Kraak-
man et al., 1999; Harashima and Heitman, 2002). We also
showed that the Gpa2-Gpr1 C-terminal tail interaction can
be detected using the GFP tagged C-terminal tail of Gpr1 in
vivo (Figures 5 and 8). These data indicate that the Gpr1
C-terminus plays an important role in Gpa2 binding. This
atypical feature of the Gpr1 receptor-Gpa2 G␣complex may
mirror the unusual aspects by which the kelch subunits
Gpb1/2 inhibit the signaling complex.

Is Gpa2 an Unusual G␣ or an Ancestral G␣ Subunit?
Our studies provide evidence that lipid modiﬁcations (my-
ristoylation and palmitoylation) of G␣ Gpa2 are necessary
and sufﬁcient for Gpa2 plasma membrane targeting but are
not required for interaction with the kelch G␤mimic subunit
Gpb2. Instead, Gpa2 directs Gpb2 to the plasma membrane.
Mammalian G␣ subunits as well as the yeast canonical G␣
subunit Gpa1 share similar features. Like Gpa2, lipid mod-
iﬁcations but not the G␤␥ dimer are required for plasma
membrane localization of yeast Gpa1 and mammalian G␣
(Song et al., 1996; Gillen et al., 1998; Galbiati et al., 1999). It
has also been reported that a nonlipidated G␣ still binds to
G␤␥ subunits in yeast and mammals (Jones et al., 1990;
Degtyarev et al., 1994; Song et al., 1996). Studies also provide
evidence that G␣, at least in part, directs G␤␥subunits to the
plasma membrane in vivo (Song et al., 1996; Takida and
Wedegaertner, 2003). Although Gpa2 shares similar features
with canonical G␣ subunits, a striking contrast is the inabil-
ity of Gpa2 to form a heterotrimeric G protein. The G␣
subunit Gpa1 in the ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
which functions in pheromone-mediated signaling, also fails
to form a heterotrimeric G protein with the known G␤␥
subunits Git5/11. The kelch protein Ral2 has been proposed
as a possible Gpa1-associated subunit based on genetic stud-
ies (Fukui et al., 1989; Harashima and Heitman, 2002; Hoff-
man, 2005).

Another contrast between canonical G␣ subunits and
Gpa2 is that G␤␥ subunits typically promote receptor-G␣
coupling, whereas Gpb1/2 inhibit receptor-Gpa2 coupling

Novel Heteromeric G Protein Signaling

(Figure 9). The receptor Gpr1 and G␣ Gpa2 can still in part
function and signal in response to glucose without the G␤
mimic subunits Gpb1/2, indicating a promiscuous and spe-
ciﬁc coupling between Gpr1 and Gpa2 even in the absence of
Gpb1/2 (Harashima and Heitman, 2002). In S. cerevisiae, the
cAMP-PKA signaling pathway is essential for cell growth
and determines cell fates in response to extracellular nutri-
ents (Harashima and Heitman, 2004). Therefore the cAMP-
PKA signaling pathway should be strictly controlled, and
for this reason, Gpb1/2 may interfere with promiscuous
Gpr1-Gpa2 coupling to facilitate responses to extracellular
nutrients. On the other hand, in canonical G proteins, the
G␤␥ dimer may control G␣ function by increasing the spec-
iﬁcity of receptor coupling (Richardson and Robishaw, 1999;
Hou et al., 2001; Lim et al., 2001; Ku¨ hn et al., 2002). Impor-
tantly, the kelch G␤ mimic subunits Gpb1/2 and canonical
G␤␥ dimer both regulate receptor-G␣ coupling. Thus, the
Gpa2/Gpb1/2 protein complex shares features with canon-
ical heterotrimeric G proteins, and we propose Gpa2 is an
ancestral subunit rather than an unusual G␣subunit. In this
model, eukaryotic cells ﬁrst acquired a GPCR and associated
G␣ subunit to sense and signal extracellular cues. Later,
seven-bladed ␤-propeller-type subunits (kelch or WD40
based) were recruited to the GPCR-G␣ signaling complex.
Finally, farnesylated G␥subunits were recruited to promote
membrane localization. In this model, the atypical features
of the nutrient and pheromone GPCR-G␣signaling modules
in budding and ﬁssion yeasts might mirror features of their
ancestral signaling modules from which they derive.

Alternatively, yeasts might uniquely have evolved an “al-
ternative” G␣ subunit and established a novel G protein
signaling system to sense extracellular stimuli, in which an
atypical G␣ subunit forms a complex and functions with an
unusual binding-partner kelch G␤ mimic protein. Further
studies in both unicellular and multicellular organisms
would distinguish these possibilities.
