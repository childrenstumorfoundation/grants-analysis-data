with Lipid Rafts

ABSTRACT

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic disorder characterized by
bilateral schwannomas of the eighth cranial nerve. The NF2 tumor sup-
pressor protein, merlin, is related to the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin)
family of membrane/F-actin linkers. Merlin resists solubilization by the
detergent Triton X-100 (TX-100), a property commonly attributed to
association with the cytoskeleton. Accordingly, NF2 patient mutations that
encode merlins with enhanced TX-100 solubility have been explained
previously in terms of loss of cytoskeletal attachment. However, here we
present data to suggest that the detergent resistance of merlin is a result
of its constitutive residence in lipid rafts. Furthermore, when cells are
grown to high density, merlin shifts to a more buoyant lipid raft fraction
in a density gradient. This shift is mimicked in subconfluent cells treated
with cytochalasin D, suggesting that the shift results from merlin dissoci-
ation from the actin cytoskeleton, but not from lipid rafts. Intramolecular
NH2- and COOH-terminal binding, which occurs when merlin transitions
to the growth-suppressive form, also brings about a similar change in
buoyant density. Our results suggest that constitutive residence of merlin
in lipid rafts is crucial for its function and that as merlin becomes growth
suppressive in vivo, one significant molecular event may be the loss of
interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. To our knowledge, merlin is the
first tumor suppressor known to reside within lipid rafts, and the signif-
icance of this finding is underscored by known loss-of-function NF2
patient mutations that encode merlins with enhanced TX-100 solubility.

INTRODUCTION

Merlin (schwannomin) is the Mr

⬃70,000 tumor suppressor protein
product of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene (1, 2). NF2 is
inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with an incidence of approx-
imately 1 in 40,000. Individuals suffering from NF2 have charac-
teristic benign schwannomas arising on the eighth cranial nerve,
schwannomas of other cranial nerves and peripheral nerves, as well as
increased incidence of meningiomas and spinal ependymomas. Nf2
knockout mice die in utero (3), and mice heterozygous for an Nf2
mutation demonstrate an increased propensity for osteosarcoma, fi-
brosarcoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma formation (4). Addition-
ally, mice in which both Nf2 alleles are conditionally inactivated in
Schwann cells using the CRE/loxP system develop Schwann cell
hyperplasia and schwannomas (5). These data, coupled with the report
of widespread merlin expression in vivo (6), implicate merlin as a
crucial growth regulator for numerous cell and tissue types. Precisely
how merlin suppresses tumor growth, however, has yet to be fully
elucidated.

Merlin is a member of the band 4.1/ERM (ezrin, radixin, and
moesin) family of plasma membrane/actin cytoskeleton linkers. The

ERM proteins and merlin possess NH2-terminal four-point-one, ezrin,
radixin, moesin (FERM) domains that mediate interaction with inte-
gral membrane proteins including the hyaluronate receptor, CD44 (7).
The COOH-termini of the ERM proteins are characterized by a
conserved actin-binding motif that is absent in merlin. Merlin and
ERM proteins can self-associate to form homodimers or heterodimer-
ize with one another (8 –10). Intra-/intermolecular association is be-
lieved to regulate their activity (7). Despite their sequence similarity
and ability to associate, overexpression of merlin results in suppres-
sion of cell growth, whereas overexpression of ezrin is correlated with
cell proliferation (7).

Like ERM proteins, merlin exists in two conformations (open and
closed), but in contrast to the ERM proteins, merlin is believed to be
active (growth suppressive) in its closed conformation (10). Conver-
sion of merlin to the open, inactive form is mediated by phosphoryl-
ation (11). Strong evidence exists that merlin plays a role in cell
density-dependent growth arrest, with conversion from the inactive to
active conformation occurring with increasing cell density (12).

In many cell types, merlin is enriched within actin-rich membrane
ruffles (13–15). Cultured schwannoma cells, which lack merlin, have
an aberrant ruffling phenotype (14) that can be corrected by the
addition of exogenous merlin (16, 17), suggesting a role for merlin in
cellular actin dynamics. Merlin lacks the COOH-terminal actin-bind-
ing motif present in the ERM proteins, so it clearly lacks the capacity
to bind actin in the same way that ERM proteins do. It is far less clear,
however, if merlin binds actin directly, and what the physiological
significance of the reported (3, 14) interaction of merlin with actin via
its NH2-terminal FERM domain might be (18). Current evidence
appears to favor the interpretation that indirect binding may be pos-
sible but that direct merlin/actin binding in vivo is unlikely (19).

Merlin is insoluble in the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (TX-
100; Ref. 20). Moreover, NF2 patient mutations have been described
that render merlin more soluble in TX-100 (15, 21). Historically,
insolubility in nonionic detergents has been viewed as an indicator of
association with the cytoskeleton. Not surprisingly, therefore, the
molecular defect of such NF2 mutations has been assumed to be
weakened association with the cytoskeleton. However, studies in the
last decade have shown that certain microdomains of the plasma
membrane and, to some extent, internal membranes are also resistant
to solubilization in nonionic detergents because of their uniquely tight
packing of glycosphingolipids and cholesterol moieties (22). Such
microdomains
aptly called detergent-resistant membranes
(DRMs), and they fall into two main subclasses, lipid rafts and
caveolae. Proteins that associate with DRMs would also be expected
to be detergent insoluble. Prominent among such proteins are key
players in known signal transduction pathways (e.g., integrins and the
Src family kinases) and membrane trafficking (22). Prevailing opinion
is that concentration of signaling proteins in a physical “platform”
increases the specificity and efficiency of their interactions and thus
enhances the signaling event (22).

are

Because there is strong evidence that merlin is involved in a
number of signaling pathways (18, 23), and because known merlin-
binding partners have been localized to DRMs (24), we sought to
determine whether merlin was localized to DRMs, and whether this
could account for the previously reported detergent resistance of

merlin. We found that the bulk of cellular merlin is localized within
lipid rafts, whereas virtually no ezrin was DRM associated. Our data
also indicate that raft residence, not actin association, is primarily
responsible for the detergent resistance of merlin. Additionally, al-
though merlin is constitutively localized to lipid rafts, the buoyant
density of merlin-containing lipid rafts changes with cell density and
with the conversion of merlin from the open, inactive conformation to
the closed, active conformation. This change likely reflects a disso-
ciation of merlin-containing lipid rafts from cytoskeletal proteins and
suggests that, as merlin becomes growth suppressive in vivo, a sig-
nificant molecular event may be the loss of interaction with the actin
cytoskeleton (11). Our observations indicate, however, that this im-
portant transition occurs within the signaling-rich environment of
lipid rafts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reagents and Supplies. Unless noted, all reagents were purchased from
Sigma. Polyclonal anti-Fyn (SC-16) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology, polyclonal anti-caveolin was purchased from BD Biosciences, mono-
clonal anti-green fluorescent protein was purchased from Roche, monoclonal
anti-ezrin was purchased from Sigma, monoclonal anti-T7 was purchased from
Novagen, and monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin was purchased from Covance.
N3 enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) vector was purchased from
ClonTech, and pcDNA3 vector was purchased from Invitrogen. Fluorescence-
conjugated secondary antibodies and phalloidin were purchased from Molec-
ular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent immunoblot detection kit were
purchased from Pierce. N-Octyl-␤-D-glucopyranoside (n-OG) was purchased
from Fisher.

Cell Culture. U251 cells (a gift from Dr. Steven Berberich, Wayne State
University) and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies,
Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS (United States Bio-Technologies Inc.) and
100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transient trans-
fection was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.)
according to the manufacturer’s directions. To create merlin-eGFP-expressing
clonal cell lines, 105 U251 cells were plated on 6-well plates and then
transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000. On the following day, cells were
trypsinized and replated onto 100-mm dishes in medium containing 250 ␮g/ml
G418, and fluorescent colonies were isolated. Expression of fusion proteins of
the expected length was confirmed by Western blot analysis.

DNA Cloning. Full-length merlin isoform I (growth-suppressive form) was
amplified from a modified pBluescript vector (pMKS) using PCR and cloned
into an eGFP vector (N3 vector; ClonTech) using SalI and BamHI. When
expressed in cells, the construct encoded a fusion protein of merlin fused to the
NH2 terminus of eGFP (merlin-eGFP). T7 epitope-tagged NH2-terminal merlin
and hemagglutinin-tagged COOH-terminal merlin constructs were created by
including codons for these epitopes in the 5⬘ region of sense strand primers
used for amplification. BamHI and EcoRI sites were also included in 5⬘ ends
of sense and antisense primers, respectively, for directional cloning of PCR
products into pcDNA3.

Immunofluorescence. Cells (2 ⫻ 104) were plated onto glass coverslips
and allowed to adhere overnight. The following morning, cells were removed
from the incubator, and the subsequent steps were performed at room temper-
ature. Cells were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and then fixed
using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, followed by permeabilization
using ice-cold 1% TX-100 in TBS for 3 min. The order of addition was
reversed for cells that were detergent extracted before fixation. Coverslips
were blocked using 5% nonfat milk in TBS for 30 min and then incubated in
primary antibody in TBS (1:250 for caveolin, 1:100 for Fyn) for 1 h. After
three washes with TBS, fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000
in TBS) was added for 1 h, followed by three washes in TBS, one wash in
water, and mounting onto slides. For labeling of F-actin, fluorescence-labeled
Alexa 633 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used per manufacturer’s direc-
tions.

Subcellular Fractionation and Detergent Extraction of Cells. S100/
P100 fractionation was performed as described previously (25) using 106

NIH3T3 cells on 60-mm dishes transfected with epitope-tagged merlin expres-
sion constructs. After centrifugation, the S100 supernatant (cytosol) was re-
moved, and proteins were precipitated by the addition of 4 volumes of cold
acetone. To extract TX-100-soluble membrane proteins, the P100 pellet was
resuspended in 200 ␮l of ice-cold 1% TX-100 in TBS and placed on ice for 15
min. The TX-100-resistant material was pelleted at 14,000 rpm in a micro-
centrifuge at 4°C for 15 min. To solubilize DRM proteins, the TX-100-
resistant pellet was resuspended in 200 ␮l of ice-cold 100 mM n-OG in TBS
and placed on ice for 15 min followed by a 15-min centrifugation in a
microcentrifuge as described above. Pellets were resuspended in 200 ␮l of 1%
TX-100/TBS, and then 200 ␮l of 2⫻ SDS-PAGE sample buffer were added to
each fraction, and tubes were boiled for 5 min. Equal volumes of each fraction
were loaded for SDS-PAGE analysis. For TX-100 solubility analysis of U251
cells, 2 ⫻ 106 clonal cells expressing merlin-eGFP were plated per well of a
6-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were collected as described
above and lysed in 200 ␮l of ice-cold 1% TX-100 followed by 15 min of
centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. Pellets were resuspended in 200 ␮l of 1%
TX-100/TBS, and all tubes were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described above.
Optiprep Density Centrifugation. Density centrifugation was adapted
from Oliferenko et al. (24). Clonal U251 cells (2 ⫻ 106) expressing merlin-
eGFP were plated onto 100-mm plates and allowed to adhere overnight. For
NIH3T3 cells, 106 cells were plated on 35- or 100-mm plates and then
transfected with merlin-eGFP for cell density experiments or plated on 60-mm
plates for epitope-tagged NH2- and COOH-terminal expression experiments.
Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were washed two times with TBS, lysed
in 267 ␮l of ice-cold Optibuffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10%
sucrose, 1 mM DTT, 1% TX-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and
protease inhibitor mixture), and then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and
put on ice for 30 min. We added 533 ␮l of 60% Optiprep to the samples (to
a final concentration of 40%), and lysates were transferred to ultracentrifuge
tubes. A gradient was created by the sequential layering of 800 ␮l of 35%,
30%, 25%, 20%, and 0% Optiprep diluted in Optibuffer on top of the samples.
Samples were spun at 30,000 rpm (⬎107,000 ⫻ g) for 18 h at 4°C in an
SW50.1 rotor. After centrifugation, 800-␮l fractions were removed in reverse
order of addition. Eighty ␮l of each fraction were mixed with 20 ␮l of 5⫻
SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Forty ␮l were loaded per well
of a 4 –12% NuPAGE precast SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen).

Immunoblot Analysis. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to
nitrocellulose and blocked overnight at 4°C using 5% nonfat milk diluted in
TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST). Subsequent steps were carried out at
room temperature. After three 5-min washes in TBST, primary antibody
diluted in blocking solution was added, and blots were rocked for 1 h.
Antibodies were diluted as follows: anti-green fluorescent protein, 1:1,000;
anti-ezrin, 1:4,000; anti-caveolin, 1:5,000; anti-hemagglutinin, 1:1,000; and
anti-T7, 1:10,000. Blots were then washed six times, 5 min each, and then
rocked fo r 1 h inhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (di-
luted 1:10,000 in blocking solution). After six 5-min washes, horseradish
peroxidase was detected by a 10-min incubation with enhanced chemilumi-
nescence reagent followed by exposure to X-ray film.

Cholesterol Depletion and Actin Disruption. For cholesterol depletion,
cells were washed two times with HBSS and then incubated with DMEM with
or without 10 mM methyl-␤-cyclodextrin (CD) and returned to the incubator
for 30 min. Disruption of cellular F-actin was carried out by the addition of
cytochalasin D for 90 min to a final concentration of 10 ␮M.

RESULTS

Previous workers (9, 13, 14, 26, 27) noted a high degree of
localization of merlin in some, but not all, F-actin-containing subcel-
lular domains. We further examined this issue by a confocal micro-
scope immunocytochemical analysis of U251 cells expressing eGFP-
tagged merlin. As reported previously, merlin and actin frequently,
but not always, colocalized at cortical regions of the cell. Addition-
ally, we detected a previously overlooked mode of merlin localization:
a finely dispersed and punctate fluorescent pattern extending over
large expanses of the cell membrane (Fig. 1A, top row). This was not
an artifact associated with the fusion of merlin to eGFP because cells
transfected with a vector encoding eGFP alone showed uniform and

MERLIN-LIPID RAFT INTERACTIONS

To further investigate the interrelationship between merlin and the
microfilament network, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with merlin-
eGFP and prepared P100 fractions containing cellular membranes and
cytoskeletal elements. This fraction was resuspended in TBS contain-
ing the nonionic detergent 1% TX-100 and separated into soluble (S)
and insoluble (I) components (Fig. 1B). In agreement with previous
results (15, 23), merlin was virtually insoluble in 1% TX-100. We
further reasoned that if the detergent resistance of merlin was due to
direct association of merlin with F-actin, as has been assumed by
previous workers (23, 28), then disruption of the F-actin network
should result in the solubilization of merlin in TX-100. To test this
hypothesis, we included 1 M potassium iodide (KI) in the Triton
extraction buffer to depolymerize F-actin (29). Although this treat-
ment effectively solubilized all of the F-actin, a significant amount of
merlin remained in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1B). This suggested the
presence of two TX-100-insoluble pools of cellular merlin: an F-actin-
associated pool; and a second pool that is detergent resistant for
reasons other than association with F-actin.

One possibility for the observed actin-independent detergent resist-
ance of merlin was localization of merlin to DRMs. DRMs are plasma
membrane microdomains involved in numerous signal transduction
processes, and, similar to cytoskeletal elements, they resist solubili-
zation by nonionic detergents such as TX-100 (30, 31). We examined
the putative localization of merlin to DRMs by means of a solubility
assay. NIH3T3 cells expressing merlin-eGFP were first separated into
cytosolic (S100) and membrane-bound (P100) fractions. The P100
pellet was then separated into TX-100-soluble, n-OG (a detergent
known to solubilize some DRMs; Ref. 32)-soluble, and detergent-
resistant fractions. The various fractions were then subjected to im-
munoblot analysis (Fig. 2A). In agreement with published results on
non-epitope-tagged merlin (15), virtually no merlin-eGFP was found
in the cytosolic fraction, and only a minute amount was found to be
soluble in TX-100 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, under these experimental
conditions, ezrin was nearly completely cytosolic (Fig. 2A), as was
eGFP alone (data not shown). This is consistent with previous data
suggesting that the bulk of cellular ezrin is cytoplasmic (33) and that
the ezrin (and possibly other ERM proteins) localized to DRMs likely
represents only a small fraction of the total cellular ezrin (34). On the
other hand, the essentially complete resistance of merlin to cold
TX-100 and partial solubility in n-OG argued that a significant pro-
portion of the cellular merlin was resident in DRMs (Fig. 2A). These
solubility properties are nearly identical to those of several proteins
recently identified to be within DRM-H, a subset of DRMs in neu-
trophils that were partially soluble in n-OG and had slightly higher
density due to attachment to the membrane skeleton (35).

Density gradient fractionation of U251 cells expressing merlin-
eGFP was performed to confirm the localization of merlin to DRMs.
DRMs and their associated proteins float to the top of density gradi-
ents and can thus be distinguished from the bulk of cellular material.
When U251 cells expressing merlin-eGFP were lysed with cold 1%
TX-100 and then separated on an Optiprep density gradient, merlin-
eGFP was found primarily in the DRM-containing 20% and 25%
fractions (Fig. 2B), consistent with localization to lipid rafts. Ezrin (as
well as free green fluorescent protein; data not shown) was found in
the 35% and 40% fractions, as expected for a cytoplasmic, TX-100-
soluble protein (Fig. 2A). It is important to note that the density
gradients were performed using total cell lysates that were not further
fractionated. Thus, the preponderance of merlin in the 20% and 25%
fractions indicates that essentially all cellular merlin is localized to
DRMs.

DRM organization is dependent on the presence of cholesterol.
Treatment with the cholesterol-sequestering reagent CD destabilizes
DRMs and can render DRM-associated proteins more soluble in

Fig. 1. Merlin detergent resistance is partially dependent on F-actin. A, cells were fixed
either before (top row) or after (bottom row) extraction with cold 1% Triton X-100 and
imaged by confocal microscopy. F-actin, labeled with Alexa 633-phalloidin, is shown in
red; merlin-enhanced green fluorescent protein is shown in green. Optical sections were
taken at the level of the ventral plasma membrane, adjacent to the coverslip. The merged
image is shown at the right, where areas of actin-merlin colocalization appear yellow. The
scale bar represents 10 ␮m. B, P100 fractions from 106 NIH3T3 cells expressing
merlin-enhanced green fluorescent protein were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in
Tris-buffered saline with or without 1 M potassium iodide to depolymerize F-actin.
Whereas potassium iodide treatment does appear to increase the solubility of merlin, note
that a significant population of merlin remains detergent resistant after actin depolymer-
ization (⫹1M KI).

diffuse fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm, with no specific lo-
calization to subcellular structures (data not shown).

It is important to note that although this pattern of merlin localiza-
tion has not been described previously, it is fully consistent with
published images of merlin localization. The images of U251 cells
immunolabeled for endogenous merlin in Sainio et al. (27) and
Gronholm et al. (9), although lower in magnification, strongly suggest
a punctate merlin pattern in both subconfluent and confluent cultures.
Similarly, the images presented by Schmucker et al. (26) of human
foreskin fibroblasts immunostained for endogenous merlin using a
commercial anti-merlin antibody, sc332 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
show a punctate pattern at the plasma membrane.

To determine whether the punctate merlin-containing structures
were associated with F-actin, merlin-eGFP-expressing cells were ex-
tracted with cold 1% TX-100 before fixation and labeling for F-actin.
Confocal images taken at or near the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A,
bottom row) showed that the punctate pattern of merlin localization
was even more pronounced after TX-100 extraction. Moreover, many
of the puncta appeared to align with actin-containing stress fibers, a
feature not readily observable in unextracted cells (Fig. 1A). This
suggested that removal of the TX-100-soluble portion of the plasma
membrane resulted in an aggregation of merlin-containing mem-
branes, many of which appeared to colocalize with F-actin.

virtually complete coincidence of fluorescence. Images at higher
magnification (Fig. 3B) demonstrate colocalization at the level of
individual puncta. In contrast, overlap of merlin with caveolin was
minimal and confined to the edges of the cell (Fig. 3C, left panel).
Elsewhere in the cell, merlin- and caveolin-containing puncta did not
coincide, as is evident in high-magnification images (Fig. 3C, right
panel). Thus, the bulk of the punctate, TX-100-insoluble merlin, was
localized to lipid rafts, not caveolae.

What might be the physiological significance of the residence of
merlin in lipid rafts? Lipid rafts are widely recognized to be sites of
concentration of signaling molecules and, as such, serve to enhance
the efficiency of signal transduction events. Because merlin is known
to inhibit signaling pathways leading to cell growth (7), we thus
explored the extent to which merlin resided in lipid rafts under
proliferative and growth-suppressive conditions.

NIH3T3 fibroblasts, a system used extensively for studying merlin
function (11), were used to determine whether residence of merlin in
lipid rafts was sensitive to its functional state. One million NIH3T3
fibroblasts were plated onto 100- and 35-mm tissue culture dishes and
allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then transfected with merlin-
eGFP and returned to the incubator for an additional 24 h. At the end
of this period, the cells in the 35-mm dish were fully confluent, with
all cells being in contact with their neighbors (a condition shown to
favor the active form of merlin), whereas very little cell-cell contact
was seen among the cells in the 100-mm dish (a condition shown to
favor the inactive form of merlin).

Fig. 3. Merlin colocalizes with lipid rafts but not caveolae. U251 cells expressing
merlin-enhanced green fluorescent protein were labeled with an anti-Fyn (A and B) or
anti-caveolin (C) antibody after detergent extraction and fixation and then examined by
confocal microscopy. Control staining that lacked primary antibody but included second-
ary antibody showed no fluorescence (data not shown). Fyn and caveolin are in red,
merlin is in green, and areas of colocalization appear yellow. The boxed area in the left
panel of C is enlarged in the right panel. The scale bar represents 10 ␮m for A and the
left panel of C and 5 ␮m for B and the right panel of C.

Fig. 2. Merlin resides in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). A, 106 NIH3T3 cells
on 60-mm dishes were transfected with merlin-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)
or eGFP (data not shown) and then separated into S100 (cytoplasm) and P100 fractions.
The Triton X-100-soluble (TX-100 sol) proteins from the P100 fraction were extracted,
and then the remainder of the material was resuspended in N-octyl-␤-D-glucopyranoside
to solubilize DRM components (n-OG sol). The material that remained after N-octyl-␤-
D-glucopyranoside treatment is labeled detergent resistant (det. resistant). Note the distinct
difference between the solubility of ezrin and merlin. B, 2 ⫻ 106 clonal U251 cells
expressing merlin-eGFP were plated on 100-mm dishes and allowed to adhere overnight
before separation in an Optiprep gradient. Merlin is predominantly found in the 20% and
25% fractions, a hallmark of DRM-associated proteins. Ezrin, as a soluble cytosplasmic
protein (see A), remains in the 35% and 40% fractions. Caveolin is shown as a positive
control for flotation of DRM-associated proteins. C, 2 ⫻ 106 clonal U251 cells expressing
merlin-eGFP were plated on 100-mm dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were
then treated with 10 mM methyl-␤-cyclodextrin (CD) for 30 min to disrupt lipid raft

gradient. Note the disappearance of merlin from the 20% lipid raft fraction of CD-treated
cells and a similar (albeit slighter) shift of caveolin to heavier fractions.

TX-100 (36). CD treatment of U251 cells resulted in a 2-fold increase
in the amount of Triton-soluble merlin-eGFP (data not shown). This
modest increase supports the idea that intact lipid rafts contribute to
the detergent resistance of merlin and is consistent with the observa-
tion by other investigators that the effect of CD is not quantitative
(36). Although the change in detergent solubility of merlin after
disruption of lipid rafts was modest, the buoyancy of merlin, as seen
by Optiprep gradient centrifugation, was altered significantly. As
shown in Fig. 2C, CD treatment eliminated the presence of merlin in
the 20% fraction, greatly reduced its flotation into the 25% fraction,
and enhanced its presence in the 30% fraction, thus confirming that
flotation of merlin in density gradients is dependent on intact DRMs.
Importantly, only a very small amount of merlin shifted to the TX-
100-soluble 35% fraction, and no merlin shifted into the 40% fraction
on CD treatment, consistent with the observation that CD exposure
does not render merlin quantitatively detergent soluble.

Lipid rafts and caveolae are the two major classes of DRMs. To
explore whether merlin was localized to lipid rafts, caveolae, or both,
U251 cells expressing merlin-eGFP were extracted with TX-100 and
examined by confocal microscopy after staining for a lipid raft
marker, Fyn, or a marker for caveolae, caveolin. Merlin colocalized
with the lipid raft marker Fyn (Fig. 3A), with some cells showing

MERLIN-LIPID RAFT INTERACTIONS

As shown in Fig. 4B, F-actin disruption before gradient fraction-
ation increased the abundance of merlin in the 20% fraction and
correspondingly decreased the abundance in the 25% and 30%
fractions. This increase in merlin buoyancy is nearly identical to
what was observed in cells favoring active merlin (Fig. 4A).
Because merlin appears to be localized to lipid rafts regardless of
whether the actin cytoskeleton is intact or not, it is likely that the
increase in merlin buoyancy that occurs after cytochalasin treat-
ment reflects the dissolution of a physical link between the actin
cytoskeleton and merlin-containing lipid rafts. Accordingly, the
increase in merlin buoyancy in cells grown to high density is likely
the result of merlin adopting the closed conformation and its
concomitant dissociation from the microfilament network.

To further test whether the interconversion of merlin between the
active and inactive conformation induced changes in its lipid raft
interactions, we used an established experimental paradigm to model
the opening and closing of ERM proteins and merlin (10, 37). In this
system, expressing each half-molecule separately mimics the inactive,
open conformation, whereas coexpression of the two halves allows
their interaction, reconstituting the closed conformation. Sherman et
al. (10) demonstrated that coexpression of the NH2- and COOH-
terminal halves of merlin results in a functionally active, growth-
suppressive molecule, whereas each half expressed separately has no
effect on cell growth.

We created T7 and hemagglutinin epitope-tagged expression
constructs for the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of merlin,
respectively, and expressed them either individually or together in
NIH3T3 cells. When expressed individually in NIH3T3 cells, both
the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of merlin localized to the
detergent-resistant fraction of P100 (Fig. 5A, top panel), with trace
amounts of the NH2-terminal half appearing in the cytosolic and
TX-100-soluble fractions. This result is consistent with the pres-
ence of membrane-associating domains in both the NH2- and
COOH-terminal halves. Optiprep gradient analysis showed that
both halves were predominantly in the 25% DRM fraction (Fig. 5B,
top panel). These results suggest that each half of the merlin
molecule, in addition to simple membrane targeting elements, also
possesses lipid raft targeting information and support our hypoth-
esis that
the open,
inactive conformation of merlin resides in
“heavy” lipid rafts.

When coexpressed, the two halves of merlin cofractionated in both
the detergent solubilization (Fig. 5A) and Optiprep (Fig. 5B) assays,
suggesting they are bound to one another, forming the closed confor-
mation as reported previously (10). The coexpressed half-molecules
remained in the P100 fraction, with a significant increase in the
amount of protein soluble in TX-100 and n-OG (Fig. 5A, bottom
panel), supporting the notion that closing of merlin does not cause it
to be released into the cytosol. In Optiprep gradients (Fig. 5B, bottom
panel), both halves of merlin migrated from the detergent-resistant
heavy rafts (25% Optiprep) into lighter rafts (20% Optiprep) and
TX-100-soluble portions of the plasma membrane (30 – 40% Opti-
prep). In summary, our results support a model whereby activation
of merlin results in a shift of merlin from heavy rafts to lighter rafts
(Fig. 6).

DISCUSSION

The Physiological Significance of Merlin Lipid Raft Localiza-
tion. We have presented evidence that the tumor suppressor protein
merlin is constitutively localized to lipid rafts. The evidence is 3-fold:
merlin colocalizes with a lipid raft marker, Fyn; has limited solubility
in cold TX-100; and has buoyancy in a density gradient expected of
a lipid raft resident protein. In contrast, its close relative in the ERM

Fig. 4. Increased cell density or disruption of microfilaments increases the buoyancy of
merlin. In A and B, the top pair of blots was probed for merlin, and the bottom pair was
probed for caveolin as a control for a detergent-resistant membrane-associated protein. A,
106 NIH3T3 cells were plated on 100- or 35-mm plates as described in “Materials and
Methods” to create low and high cell density growth conditions, respectively. After 24 h,
cells were transiently transfected with merlin-enhanced green fluorescent protein and
returned to the incubator for an additional 24 h before Optiprep fractionation. Note the
shift of merlin into the 20% fraction when cells were grown to high density, whereas the
flotation of caveolin was unaffected by changes in cell density. B, to disrupt F-actin, U251
cells were treated with 10 ␮M cytochalasin D 90 min before gradient centrifugation (⫹cyto
D). Vehicle-treated control cells are labeled ⫺cyto D. Note the increased amount of merlin
in the 20% fraction in treated cells. In contrast, the flotation of caveolin is unaffected by
F-actin disruption.

By density gradient centrifugation analysis, all of the merlin was
resistant to TX-100 solubilization under both growth conditions, as
evidenced by its continued presence in DRM fractions. However,
under low cell density conditions, which favored inactivation of
merlin,
the bulk of the merlin appeared in the 25% Optiprep
fraction, with a trace amount in the 20% Optiprep fraction (Fig.
4A). In contrast, merlin from cells grown to confluence (which
favored activation of merlin) showed an increased presence in the
20% Optiprep fraction, with trailing amounts in the 25% fraction
and a minute amount
in the 30% fraction. Thus, whereas the
solubility of merlin did not change with cell density, and the
preponderance of merlin resided in lipid rafts regardless of cell
density, activated, growth-suppressive merlin has higher buoyancy
than functionally inactive, growth-permissive merlin. One possible
explanation for this behavior is that with the transition to a growth-
suppressive state, merlin dissociates from one or more binding
partners that affect its buoyancy without affecting its attachment to
lipid rafts. This interpretation is consistent with a recent report by
Nebl et al. (35), in which the authors describe a less buoyant subset
of DRMs in bovine neutrophils (DRM-H) that contain bound
cytoskeletal proteins such as ␤-fodrin and actin.

Because merlin is believed to dissociate from actin-based struc-
tures when it assumes its active, growth-suppressive (i.e., closed)
conformation (11), we hypothesized that the less buoyant merlin
seen at low cell density could be due to direct or indirect associ-
ation with the F-actin cytoskeleton when merlin is in the open
conformation. To test directly whether the flotation of merlin is
influenced by the actin cytoskeleton, we treated subconfluent
merlin-eGFP-expressing U251 cells with cytochalasin D to disrupt
their microfilament network and then suspended the cells in cold
1% TX-100 and subjected them to gradient centrifugation analysis.

ent centrifugation analysis revealed that this localization is quite
dynamic and likely related to the function of merlin as a regulator
of cell growth. When cells grew to high density, merlin shifted
from a heavier to a lighter lipid raft-containing fraction (Fig. 4A),
and a similar shift occurred when the NH2-terminal and COOH-
terminal halves of merlin were coexpressed in the same cells (Fig.
5B). High cell density favors the active, growth-suppressive,
closed conformation of merlin (12, 40), and coexpression of the
NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal half-molecules is an experi-
mental paradigm that has been shown to mimic the closed (active)
state of merlin (10). When cells were treated with cytochalasin D
before gradient fractionation, a similar shift of merlin to a lighter
raft fraction was also seen (Fig. 4B), suggesting that partial disas-
sembly of the F-actin cytoskeleton leads to physical detachment of
merlin from the cytoskeleton. Taken together, our data support a
model whereby, in its transition from being growth permissive to
growth suppressive, merlin dissociates from a less buoyant, actin-
rich, lipid raft complex and enters another subset of rafts that are
more buoyant (Fig. 6). Indeed, the translocation of proteins be-
tween different subsets of lipid rafts is thought to be one mecha-
nism by which signaling pathways are regulated because the trans-
location may allow a given protein to initiate or terminate an
interaction with another protein (41).

Interestingly, the coexpression of merlin half-molecules was dis-
similar to the expression of the full-length merlin molecule in one
respect. When coexpressed in cells, the two halves of merlin exhibited
greater TX-100 solubility than when they were expressed individually
(Fig. 5). In contrast, full-length merlin does not become more soluble
under any condition. This may be because protein conformation and
dynamics of the full-length molecule are not fully approximated by
the two half-molecules bound to one another. Additionally, the full-
length molecule may possess capacity for interaction with raft pro-
teins that is lost with coexpression of half-molecules. Alternatively, it
is possible that the coexpressed half-molecules associate and dissoci-
ate in a steady state; once dissociated, the probability of re-binding
may be less than that of the re-closing of the full-length molecule after
opening.

Other facets of merlin function may also be dependent on its
localization to lipid rafts. Merlin has been localized to endosomes
(42), and recent work has shown that many clathrin-independent
endocytic processes occur from lipid rafts (43). In Nf2⫺/⫺ mouse
embryo fibroblasts, adherens junctions are destabilized as a result of
loss of merlin (44). Interestingly, many members of the cadherins
superfamily of junctional proteins interact with the Src family kinase,
Fyn, and are localized to lipid rafts (45). Additionally, merlin has been

Fig. 5. Merlin translocates between different classes of lipid rafts as cell density
changes. NIH3T3 cells (106) on 60-mm dishes were transfected with NH2-or COOH-
terminal expression constructs and subjected to sequential detergent fractionation (A) or
Optiprep gradient fractionation (B). When expressed individually, the two halves of
merlin mimic the behavior of full-length merlin at low cell density (i.e., the open, inactive
conformation). However, when coexpressed, the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves ap-
proximate the flotation and solubility behavior of active merlin.

family, ezrin, is almost completely cytosolic (Fig. 2) and behaves as
a cytosolic protein in density gradient centrifugation.

There is suggestive evidence from previous genetic studies that
the localization of merlin to lipid rafts may be of physiological
significance. Patient mutations in NF2 have been identified that
encode merlin proteins with increased solubility in TX-100 (15,
21). Although this has been attributed to dissociation from the
cytoskeleton (15, 21),
it stems from
attenuation of merlin-lipid raft association. Indeed, we have shown
that intact microfilaments are not required for the TX-100 deter-
gent resistance of merlin (Fig. 4B). We are currently working to
determine whether TX-100-soluble mutant merlin proteins show
decreased affinity for lipid rafts.

is equally tenable that

it

The observation that merlin is constitutively resident in regions of
the plasma membrane known to harbor a plethora of signaling mol-
ecules (31) is entirely consistent with its known function as a tumor
suppressor. In fact, the small GTPase Rac, to which merlin has been
functionally linked (11, 14), has been identified as a lipid raft com-
ponent as well (38, 39). Therefore, the key components of at least one
merlin-mediated signaling pathway are lipid raft resident. It remains
to be determined whether other upstream and downstream members of
this pathway also reside in lipid rafts.

Although merlin is constitutively localized to lipid rafts, gradi-

Fig. 6. Model for merlin activation in lipid rafts. In our model, merlin is constitutively
localized to lipid rafts. At low cell density, when the inactive form of merlin is favored,
merlin is likely to be in an open conformation. In this state, merlin is associated either
directly or indirectly (unknown mechanism denoted by question mark) with the F-actin
cytoskeleton. At high cell density, merlin switches to the active (closed) conformation,
which is promoted by intramolecular association. During this transition, merlin loses
association with the F-actin network but continues to remain in lipid rafts.

shown to participate in signal transducers and activators of transcrip-
tion (STAT) signaling (46). STAT proteins also are raft resident (47),
so it is conceivable that raft localization of merlin is important for this
function as well.

How Is Merlin Targeted to Rafts? A question of considerable
interest is how merlin is targeted to lipid rafts. Transfection studies of
constructs encoding the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal halves of
merlin indicate that both halves reside in lipid rafts when expressed
individually, suggesting that both halves contain raft-targeting se-
quences (Fig. 5). The biochemical basis for raft targeting could be
protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions (31). In the case of merlin,
the FERM domain, putative actin-binding sites, and the binding sites
for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the NH2-terminal half, as
well as the ␤II-spectrin-binding site in the COOH-terminal half, all
represent potential candidates for binding proteins or lipids that may
anchor merlin to lipid rafts. Current studies in our laboratory are
directed at defining the precise sequence requirements for raft tar-
geting.

In our initial screen of proteins that might anchor merlin to lipid
rafts, we found that three putative merlin-binding proteins, CD44 (12,
48), ␤
1 integrin (49, 50), and paxillin (51), were not required for
merlin to be in lipid rafts. In fact, these three proteins were found to
be Triton soluble in Optiprep gradients under the same conditions in
which merlin was raft associated (data not shown). These observations
are consistent with a recent report by Lallemand et al. (44), who
showed that loss of contact-dependent growth arrest in Nf2⫺/⫺ mouse
embryo fibroblasts was independent of CD44 and also failed to detect
interaction between merlin and paxillin in the same cells. Thus,
cellular factors responsible for merlin raft localization have yet to be
identified.

To our knowledge, merlin is the first tumor suppressor localized to
lipid rafts. Lipid rafts have been widely considered as regions that
positively influence cell growth (31), and the presence of merlin
within them demonstrates that growth-inhibitory signals can also be
found within these specialized membrane microdomains. The consti-
tutive localization of merlin to rafts is likely to be crucial for the
ability of merlin to intercede and disrupt positive growth cues ema-
nating from the plasma membrane.
