ABSTRACT
Background Mutations in Ras/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) pathway genes lead to a
class of disorders known as RASopathies, including
neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome (NS),
Costello syndrome (CS), and cardio-facio-cutaneous
syndrome (CFC). Previous work has suggested potential
genetic and phenotypic overlap between dysregulation of
Ras/MAPK signalling and autism spectrum disorders
(ASD). Although the literature offers conﬂicting evidence
for association of NF1 and autism, there has been no
systematic evaluation of autism traits in the RASopathies
as a class to support a role for germline Ras/MAPK
activation in ASDs.
Methods We examined the association of autism traits
with NF1, NS, CS and CFC, comparing affected
probands with unaffected sibling controls and subjects
with idiopathic ASDs using the qualitative Social
Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and the quantitative
Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS).
Results Each of the four major RASopathies showed
evidence for increased qualitative and quantitative
autism traits compared with sibling controls. Further,
each RASopathy exhibited a distinct distribution of
quantitative social impairment. Levels of social
responsiveness show some evidence of correlation
between sibling pairs, and autism-like impairment
showed a male bias similar to idiopathic ASDs.
Conclusions Higher prevalence and severity of autism
traits in RASopathies compared to unaffected siblings
suggests that dysregulation of Ras/MAPK signalling
during development may be implicated in ASD risk.
Evidence for sex bias and potential sibling correlation
suggests that autism traits in the RASopathies share
characteristics with autism traits in the general
population and clinical ASD population and can shed
light on idiopathic ASDs.

INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodeve-
lopmental disorders
speciﬁc
impairments in language, communication, social
skills and presence of restricted or repetitive inter-
ests and behaviours. The prevalence of ASDs is esti-
mated to be 0.5–2.0% in the USA.1 2 It has been
long known that several Mendelian disorders are
associated with autism. The most well established

account for up to 5% of ASDs.3 Additional rare
autosomal dominant or recessive disorders, such as
Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome, Timothy syndrome

and CHARGE syndrome have been described as
associated with autism in clinical reports.4 There is
recent resurgence of interest in rare highly pene-
trant single nucleotide variants (SNV) analogous to
these traditional genetic models that may inﬂuence
risk for idiopathic autism.5–9 To date, estimates
suggest
that SNVs and copy number variants
(CNV) acting in dominant, recessive, or X-linked
models might account for a small proportion of
autism, and common single nucleotide polymorph-
isms (SNP) can account for nearly half the variation
in autism, with the remainder yet unknown, but
potentially including additional, less penetrant rare
variants, or complex mechanisms, such as gene–

mutations in cancer, but its signalling is essential in
the regulation of

in development. Genome-wide CNV analyses
suggest Ras/MAPK pathway involvement in idio-
pathic autism.12 SNP association and rare sequence

been reported.13 14 A recent review summarises
ASD candidate genes and/or CNVs related to Ras/

separating RASopathy mutation effects

Although similarities in the cognitive and behavioural proﬁles
of RASopathies and ASDs can be extracted, no previous system-
atic assessment of ASDs or autism traits across the RASopathies
has been performed. In NF1, overall cognitive deﬁcits have
been associated with speciﬁc brain lesions (T2 hyperintensity on
MRI), thus attributed to secondary effects rather than primary
consequences of increased Ras/MAPK activity.36 Studying add-
itional RASopathies not characterised by these lesions can aid in
identifying true ‘pathway’ effects.37 38 Additionally, no data
exists
from shared
genetic and environmental similarities with unaffected siblings,
or comparing RASopathy autism trait proﬁles with a clinical
ASD sample. We therefore screened a large RASopathy popula-
tion for autism traits and compared them with unaffected
sibling controls and idiopathic ASD subjects to determine the
prevalence of autism features in each of the RASopathies indi-
vidually and whether, as a class, these disorders might shed light
on genetic risk for ASDs. This study is the ﬁrst of its kind and
can thus provide unique and important insight into the role of a
well-known signalling pathway in predisposition to ASDs.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
UCSF subjects
Subjects with RASopathies were recruited at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF) NF/Ras Pathway Genetics
Clinic and three national RASopathy family meetings (Chicago,
Illinois, USA, July 2011; Berkeley, California, USA, July 2009;
Orlando, Florida, USA, August 2013). Additional families were
recruited at a UCSF NF Symposium (November 2011), and
through RASopathy groups: NF,
Inc., Children’s Tumor
Foundation, Noonan Foundation, CFC International, Costello
Syndrome Family Support Network,
and Costello Kids.
Inclusion criteria was reported diagnosis of CFC, CS, NS, or
NF1 by a medical geneticist, or diagnosis of NF1 by a neurolo-
gist. RASopathy subjects recruited at the UCSF clinic had initial
or conﬁrmed diagnoses by a medical geneticist (KAR). NF1
diagnosis was made using well-established criteria speciﬁed by
the National
(NIH) Consensus
Development Conference.39 Diagnosis of NF1, CFC, CS and
NS subjects recruited via meetings or RASopathy groups was by
parent report, and diagnosis by molecular testing was reported
for a subset of all NF1 (11%), NS (56%), CS (84%) and CFC
(83%) subjects. All subjects had parents with ﬂuency in English.
Because not all subjects were diagnosed by study personnel or
reported a known mutation, we performed main analyses with
and without individuals with reported mutations, and deter-
mined that inclusion of non-molecular diagnoses did not have a

ally exhibited above this age. Participants less than 3 years old

(n=2), as this was a potential indicator that pertinent develop-
mental milestones had not been mastered. Subjects with idio-
pathic ASDs were recruited at the UCSF Autism Clinic and
through local outreach,
including the Golden Gate Regional
Center. All ASD subjects had received prior ASD diagnosis by a
professional and had no known autism-associated genetic disor-
ders. All participants provided written consent as approved by
the UCSF Human Research Protection Program (CHR
#10-02794).

UCLA subjects
At UCLA, participants with NF1 aged 10–45 years were
recruited via online posting (NF, Inc., and Children’s Tumor
Foundation), as well as through the Neuroﬁbromatosis and
Neurocutaneous Disorders clinic at Children’s Hospital, Los
Angeles. All had been previously diagnosed with NF1 by a phys-
ician. Prior to entering the study, a study paediatric neurologist
(TR) conﬁrmed that all NF1 participants fulﬁlled the diagnostic
criteria speciﬁed by the National Institutes of Health Consensus
Development Conference. Additional inclusion criteria required
that the subject be ﬂuent in English, have a full-scale IQ greater
than 70 with no history of MR, and no signiﬁcant intracranial
pathology (brain tumour, hydrocephalus) indicated by reports of
previously diagnosed MRI abnormalities. Because these inclu-
sion criteria were slightly different from the UCSF criteria (IQ,
MRI screening), main analyses were compared in the UCLA and
UCSF components of the NF1 sample separately, and no signiﬁ-
cant differences were noted (data not shown). All participants
provided written consent for participation, as approved by the
institutional review board of the University of California, Los
Angeles (UCLA, IRB#10-000518).

Questionnaire measures
Social Communication Questionnaire
The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ),40 based on
the Autism Diagnostic Interview,41 is used as a binary measure
of autism traits, with the threshold of scores 15 or higher used
as a proxy for signiﬁcant autism features.42 When possible, the
SCQ was given to parents of RASopathy subjects to ﬁll out per-
taining to their affected child and one healthy sibling. This
screening instrument has established validity for an autism diag-
nosis, with a sensitivity of 86% and speciﬁcity of 78% when dis-
tinguishing autism from other diagnoses (excluding intellectual
disability), and a sensitivity of 97% and speciﬁcity of 73% when
distinguishing autism from intellectual disability.42 Previous

cate that the measure of ASD traits by SCQ is unaffected by

samples.43 44

base

Social Responsiveness Scale
The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) was distributed with the
SCQ to parents of RASopathy subjects.45 46 The SRS is a
65-item parent questionnaire that measures social deﬁcits char-
acteristic of autism on a continuous severity index based on
gender-normalised transformed scores (T-scores). In a normative
sample, individuals with mild to moderate autism typically score
in a range of 60–75, and severe autism is described at 76 or
higher. When distinguishing severe autism from non-autism, the
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the SRS are 78% and 67%, respect-
ively.41 In addition to a total SRS score, subscores are given in
ﬁve domains: social communication, social motivation, social
awareness, social cognition and autistic mannerisms (restricted

interests and repetitive behaviours). Previous studies have indi-
cated that the severity of autism traits measured by the SRS is
highly heritable in clinical populations and in the general popu-
lation. Data obtained from families including at least one autistic
child report correlation for parent-report SRS scores 0.35–
0.38.47 48 Similar SRS correlations (0.37–0.63) were found in
samples of non-autistic fraternal twin pairs.49 50 Further, SRS
scores are not signiﬁcantly correlated with IQ, and not affected
by the presence of ADHD.45 49 51–53

Because we included some subjects younger than the ages for
which these instruments have been validated, analysis was per-
formed with and without the subjects younger than 3 years old
(SCQ) or 4 years old (SRS) and the results were not different
(data not shown).

Adult participants without available parents to complete the
SCQ and SRS (n=22) were given the SRS for Adults (SRS-A) to
be ﬁlled out by someone well acquainted with the participant,
such as a spouse or sibling. Each item in the SRS-A corresponds
to an item in the child and adolescent SRS, with slight variations
in content that are developmentally appropriate for adults.51
Transformed scores from the SRS-A can thus be directly com-
pared with parent-report SRS, and have been combined here.

In-person assessment
Local subjects to the San Francisco Bay Area who participated in
our study and scored at or above the ASD cutoff for SCQ, SRS, or
both (and one negative control scoring in the typical range on
both), were offered participation in more extensive in-person
assessment (n=34). Those who agreed to return for validation
were administered comprehensive autism diagnostic testing (n=7)
using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition
Generic (ADOS), Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R),
Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, Second Edition Parent/
Caregiver Rating Form (VABS-II), see below. IQ testing was per-
formed using age-appropriate Wechsler IQ tests.54 55 Additionally,
a child psychiatrist met with subjects. A consensus panel discussed
each validation subject and reviewed the research instruments and
clinical impression. This panel included a child psychiatrist (RH),
a psychologist (SR), a human geneticist (LAW), a child neurologist
(EJM), a medical geneticist specialising in RASopathies (KAR), and
the certiﬁed individual who administered the testing (FW).

Autism diagnostic observation schedule
The ADOS is a 30 min semistructured interview that assesses
social interaction, communication, play and imaginative use of
materials for individuals who may have autism.56 We used two
modules of the ADOS Second Edition adapted to verbal ﬂuency
in children (module 3) and adolescents or adults (module 4).
The ADOS has been shown to give reliable autism diagnoses in
mixed samples with ASDs, other psychopathologies, intellectual
disability and typical development,57–60 with a sensitivity of
92% and a speciﬁcity of 65% when distinguishing autism from
non-autism and a sensitivity of 87% and speciﬁcity of 47%
when distinguishing an ASD from non-autism.58 ADOS ranks
items in domains of social behaviour, communication and
restricted or stereotyped interests on a scale from 0 (not abnor-
mal) to 2 (abnormal) or 3 (severely abnormal). There is a classi-
ﬁcation of either autism or ASD when scores meet or exceed the
cutoffs for social behaviour, communication and behaviour and
communication combined. The ADOS was conducted and
scored by research-certiﬁed examiners, and sessions were video-
taped to conduct further analysis during the consensus process.

Autism diagnostic interview-revised
The ADI-R61 is a 93-item standardised interview given to a
parent or caregiver to assess autism traits according to the
DSM-IV criteria. Scoring algorithms based on age yield trans-
formed scores in reciprocal social interaction, communication
and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviours. It is often
used in conjunction with the ADOS because it assesses develop-
mental and behavioural abnormalities that are beyond the scope
of the ADOS, which captures spontaneous social behaviours in
a limited number of planned activities. Unlike the ADOS, it pro-
vides score cutoffs for autism but not ASDs. An autism classiﬁ-
cation is given when subjects receive scores above the cutoff in
all three ADI-R domains. Sensitivity and speciﬁcity in a sample
of toddlers were 92% and 72%, respectively.62 In a sample aged
5–20 years old, sensitivity and speciﬁcity were 77% and 63%.58

Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales II
The VABS take the form of a semistructured parent interview,
which we used to evaluate three areas of adaptive behaviour:
communication, daily living skills, and socialisation.63 VABS has
been used to distinguish children with autism from age-matched
and IQ-matched children with non-autistic developmental disor-
ders.64 Although VABS is affected by IQ, Kraijer et al indicated
that individuals with autism exhibit a pattern of adaptive deﬁ-
ciencies: extreme deﬁcits in socialisation, relative strengths in
daily living skills, and intermediate scores
in communica-
tion.65 66 We used the VABS (Second Edition) to broadly assess
the adaptive abilities of the RASopathy subjects relative to their
age group.

Data analysis
To assess the prevalence of autism-like impairment by group
(eg, RASopathy, control, ASD, genders), a one-sided Fisher’s
Exact
test was used to compare the proportion of above-
threshold SCQ scores, as our expectations were unidirectional
(RASopathy subjects show increased proportion, males show
increased proportion). The SRS T-score distributions were com-
pared using two-sided F-tests for variance and Student t tests
for means. One-sided t tests were used to compare mean SRS
scores between male and female cases, and to compare
RASopathy, ASD and sibling subjects. Two-sided t tests were
used to compare mean SRS
between different
RASopathies. All main analyses were conducted with and
without related individuals (eg, comparison of NF1 probands
(one per family) to only CS/CFC/NS siblings to exclude any
related pairs), in order to conﬁrm that inclusion of genetic rela-
tives did not bias our results (data not shown). Because our ana-
lyses compared each RASopathy to controls, to account for
multiple testing across the four RASopathies, we consider
p<0.01 to be criteria for signiﬁcance and 0.05>p>0.01 to be
suggestive.

scores

To assess whether the SRS subscore proﬁles were different
between RASopathy and idiopathic ASD subjects who were in
the ‘affected’ category of the SCQ, we performed a Principal
Components Analysis (PCA)
to see whether ﬁve symptom
domain subscales of the SRS (social awareness, social cognition,
social communication, social motivation and autistic manner-
isms) distinguished RASopathy from ASD subjects. The PCA was
run in R (R: A language and environment for statistical comput-
ing, Vienna, Austria) using the dudi.pca function from the ade4
package.67 68

To assess whether shared genetics inﬂuenced the severity of
autism traits within families, we tested for a correlation between

Cognitive and behavioural genetics

SRS scores of RASopathy subjects and their matched healthy sib-
lings (one pair per family). SRS scores were normalised to the
mean in each group (NF1, CS, NS, CFC and unaffected sib-
lings), and Pearson coefﬁcients and one-tailed p values were cal-
culated for sibling pairs, as we would only expect positive
sibling correlation.

RESULTS
Study population characteristics
A total of 521 individuals completed either the SRS (n=60), the
SCQ (n=22), or both (n=439). These included 81 NF1, 44 CS,
52 NS, 54 CFC, 171 ASD subjects and 119 unaffected siblings
of RASopathy subjects. There were no signiﬁcant differences in
the number of male and female participants except in ASD
(73% male, p<0.001, see online supplementary table S1). Ages
were not signiﬁcantly different between RASopathy subjects, sib-
lings and ASD subjects. In the CS sample, the most common
HRAS mutations were Gly12Ser
and Gly13Cys
(15.9%). No genetic testing results were available for 15.9% of
CS subjects. Of CFC subjects, 54.7% had BRAF mutations,
9.4% had mutations in MAP2K1, 11.3% had mutations in
MAP2K2 and 1 individual (1.9%) had a KRAS mutation. No
genetic testing results were available for 24.5% of CFC subjects.
NS subjects had mutations in PTPN11 (34.6%), SOS1 (9.6%),
SHOC2 (3.9%), KRAS (3.9%) and RAF1 (3.9%). No genetic
testing results were available for 41.2% of NS subjects. The
majority of NF1 subjects were clinically diagnosed and, there-
fore, did not report genetic mutations. Only 12.3% of NF1 sub-

reported in more than two unrelated individuals.

Prevalence of autism traits by the SCQ
SCQs were conducted for 461 individuals with ASDs (n=133),
NF1 (n=66), NS (n=48), CS (n=43), CFC (n=54), and
unaffected siblings of RASopathy subjects (n=117), and results
are summarised in ﬁgure 1. In our sample of clinically ascer-
tained ASD subjects, 85% scored at the threshold of 15 or
higher, consistent with the reported SCQ sensitivity of 86–
88%.41 42 The SCQ has a reported speciﬁcity of 72–78%.41 42
No siblings unaffected with a RASopathy met the threshold of
15 on the SCQ. When RASopathy subjects (n=213) were con-
sidered together, 27% of the total sample scored above the
threshold (compared to siblings, p<0.0001). However, above-
threshold SCQ scores were not evenly distributed between
RASopathies: 54% of CFC subjects, 26% of CS subjects, 21%
of NS subjects, and 11% of NF1 subjects had SCQ scores above
the threshold indicative of autism. The proportion of indivi-
duals meeting SCQ screening criteria for autism was signiﬁ-
cantly higher than sibling controls for CFC, NS and CS
(p<0.0001), and for NF1 (p=0.0006).

Distribution of autism traits by the SRS
The SRS was used to examine the distribution of autism traits
within and across RASopathies, as it provides a quantitative nor-
malised score. There were SRS data for 167 ASD subjects, 218
RASopathy subjects (78 NF1, 51 NS, 40 CS and 49 CFC) and
114 unaffected siblings. ASD subjects had an average trans-
formed SRS score (T-score) of 86 (SD=14); this is consistent
with SRS screening criteria for clinically signiﬁcant
social
impairments (indicated by T-scores ≥60) and for autism (T-score
≥76). RASopathy subjects combined had an average T-score of
63 (SD=16), which was signiﬁcantly lower than idiopathic ASD

(mean=74, SD=13, ﬁgure 2D),

p=4.5×10−32). The greatest impairments were seen in CFC
subjects
followed by NS
(mean=65, SD=17, ﬁgure 2C), CS (mean=61, SD=10, ﬁgure 2B),
and NF1 (mean=57, SD=16, ﬁgure 2A). The average T-score for
ASD subjects was signiﬁcantly different than CFC (p=4.4×10−7),
NS (p=7.4×10−17), CS (4.1×10−22), and NF1 (2.8×10−34)
(ﬁgure 2). The average sibling T-score was signiﬁcantly lower than
all RASopathies: CFC (p=4.4×10−22), NS (p=1.1×10−10), CS
(p=1.5×10−16), and NF1 (p=5.2×10−8). Comparison of the
mean T-scores within RASopathies showed that scores for CFC
subjects were signiﬁcantly different (p≤0.0018) than each of the
other three RASopathies. NF1 and NS had borderline different
SRS T-scores (p=0.011).

The distribution of SRS scores within each RASopathy is dis-
tinct if variance is taken into account. While means can identify
average differences across populations, comparison of variance
can have implications about the distribution of scores around the
mean. For example, two RASopathies could show a similar mean
in the mild to moderate range of the SRS, with one group
showing a tight unimodal distribution around this mean and the
second showing a bimodal distribution with a subset similar to
controls and a subset similar to ASDs. These might imply differ-
ent genetic mechanisms, such as a main effect of a RASopathy
mutation (unimodal) or a epistasis (bimodal). Variances were not
signiﬁcantly different between CFC and NS (p=0.11), CS
(p=0.07), or NF1 (p=0.11), or between NF1 and NS (p=0.68),
the pairs for which the means were different. However, NF1 and
NS both had signiﬁcantly higher variance than CS (p<0.001)
and unaffected siblings (p<4.3×10−10). The SD in CFC scores
(13) was not signiﬁcantly different from ASDs (14, p=0.61), but
was signiﬁcantly higher than unaffected siblings (9, p=0.0002,
ﬁgure 2D). The variance of CS scores was suggestively lower
than ASD subjects (p=0.015) but not signiﬁcantly different than
unaffected siblings (p=0.19, ﬁgure 2B). However, it should be
noted that in unaffected siblings, there is a ‘basement’ effect
where the distribution is cut off by a lower bound.

SRS scores by SCQ threshold
To determine whether the SRS score distribution within the
RASopathies was bimodal
(eg, consisting of subpopulations
similar to unaffected siblings and similar to ASD subjects), we
analysed the average SRS T-score for RASopathy subjects that
were above and below the autism threshold by SCQ. When

considering only ASD and RASopathy subjects with SCQ scores
of 15 or higher, the mean SRS T-score for RASopathy subjects
(n=53) was 79 (SD=14) and the distinction between the SRS
scores of RASopathy and ASD subjects (mean=88; SD=13) was
signiﬁcantly lower (p=1.7×10−4). On the other hand, when
considering SRS scores for RASopathy subjects (n=145) and
unaffected siblings (n=112) with an SCQ score less than 15, the
difference between the average T-scores of RASopathy subjects
(mean=59, SD=13) and unaffected siblings (mean=45; SD=9)
remained signiﬁcantly higher (p=1.3×10−19).

Patterns of deﬁcits by SRS subscales
To assess whether the RASopathies and ASDs showed distinct
patterns of social deﬁcits across domains measured by the SRS,
we analysed the domain subscores in social awareness, cogni-
tion, communication, motivation and autistic mannerisms for
subjects who were above-threshold by SCQ. Using this analysis,
we could assess whether RASopathy subjects showing signiﬁcant
autism traits had high scores driven by the same symptoms as
subjects with idiopathic ASDs. For example, we would expect
that if cognition or attention issues were driving RASopathy
scores as opposed to the more classic autistic traits,
the
RASopathy subjects would show a distinct proﬁle from idio-
pathic autism.

There were 54 RASopathy subjects with SRS scores (7 NF1,
10 CS, 10 NS, 27 CFC) and scores of 15 or higher on the SCQ.
The mean subscale scores and SDs for RASopathy and ASD sub-
jects show that both groups have impairment across the ﬁve
domains in a similar pattern, thus, RASopathy SRS scores are
not simply driven by impairment in a single domain (ﬁgure 3).
PCA using the ﬁve SRS subscale scores demonstrates that
RASopathy subjects and idiopathic ASD subjects do not cluster
separately, suggesting that they were not driven by different
components (ﬁgure 4). Further, this implies that relative genetic
homogeneity in RASopathy subjects does not dictate signiﬁcant
phenotypic homogeneity compared with idiopathic ASDs by
this measure.

Sibling correlations
We conducted correlation analyses on the SRS scores of
RASopathy subjects and their matched healthy siblings to test
for similarity between siblings potentially indicating a shared
genetic basis for social responsiveness measured by the SRS. It

to those previously reported for

has been recently suggested that variable penetrance for quan-
titative traits like IQ and social responsiveness in the presence
of a genetic risk factor, such as a CNV, might be primarily
inﬂuenced by background genetics.69 If that were the case
here, we would expect to observe sibling correlation equiva-
lent
the SRS, 0.35–
0.38.47 48 50 Correlations were calculated for 101 independ-
ent sibling pairs (21 NF1, 25 CS, 27 NS and 28 CFC).
Transformed SRS scores were normalised to the mean SRS
score for the RASopathy or for unaffected siblings, and
Pearson coefﬁcients and one-tailed p values were calculated.
The highest SRS correlations were seen between the NF1
affected-unaffected sibling pairs (r=0.41, p=0.033, see online
supplementary ﬁgure S1A) and CFC affected-unaffected sibling

pairs (r=0.29, p=0.067, see online supplementary ﬁgure S1D),
similar to previous sibling correlation, although these show
only suggestive signiﬁcance considering the number of compar-
isons we have made. However, we note that the correlations in
NF1 and CFC are driven by relative outliers, making these
data difﬁcult to interpret without replication or larger sample
sizes. The SRS correlation between CS probands and their
unaffected siblings was positive (r=0.20, p=0.17), but lower
than that of NF1 or CFC sibling pairs. The NS sibling correl-
ation is lower than the other RASopathies (r=0.071, p=0.36),
but a strong positive correlation exists when pairs with a
proband scoring below (fewer autism traits) the SRS mean for
NS (n=14) are considered separately (r=0.54, p=0.023, see
online supplementary ﬁgure S1C).

Sex bias of autism traits in the RASopathies
The male bias in autism is evident in the population prevalence
of ASDs in males and females which occurs at approximately a
4.1:1 ratio.70 The male bias in autism traits is reﬂected in our
RASopathy sample in both SCQ and SRS scores (table 2, see
online supplementary table S2). By SCQ, there was a signiﬁ-
cantly higher prevalence of above-threshold SCQ scores in
males versus females women: 38% of male RASopathy subjects
(n=102) and only 17% of the females (n=109) scored above
threshold (p=0.0003).

Male bias of autism traits was most evident in NF1: 27% of
males (n=26) and zero females (n=40) scored above the SCQ
threshold (p=0.0008). The average SRS T-score in NF1 males
was 61.3 (SD=20), while NF1 females had a borderline lower
average score (mean=54.3, SD=14, p=0.048). Higher levels of
autism traits were also seen in males for CS and CFC, although
the prevalence of social impairments in males was not signiﬁ-
cantly higher for the SRS or SCQ. Male bias was least evident
in NS subjects: 23% of all NS males (n=26) and 18% of NS
females (n=22) scored above the SCQ threshold. The mean
T-score of NS maleas was 64.9 (SD=15) compared with a mean
T-score of 64.3 (SD=20) in females (p=0.46). By contrast with
RASopathy probands, no gender differences in SRS and SCQ
scores were seen in healthy siblings.

In-person assessment using research and clinical
instruments
Subject A was an NF1 female negative control with subthres-
hold SRS and SCQ scores, and the in-person visit conﬁrmed
no impairment (see table 3). Subject B and Subject G were an
NF1 female and an NS male with borderline SRS scores of
73 and 64 and subthreshold SCQ scores of 14 and 6, respect-
ively. Although they each showed some distinct areas of social
impairment by testing and clinical
impression, neither met
ADOS or ADI-R criteria for an ASD. Subjects who scored
above the severe SRS cutoff of 75 (Subjects C, D, E, F)
received an ADOS classiﬁcation of ASD (Subject D) or autism
(Subjects C, E, F). In accordance with the ADOS, the ADI-R
indicated autism for Subjects C and F, and was only one point
below the autism cutoff for Subject E. Subject D did not meet
the ADI-R cutoffs for autism, which is consistent with the
ADOS classiﬁcation of ASD for this
subject because the
ADI-R does not have score cutoffs for ASDs other than strict
autism. In these subjects, clinical
impression conﬁrmed the
ADOS classiﬁcation, except for Subject E, who was the only
subject in this group with an SRS above 75 and a below-
threshold SCQ score. Clinical
impression of Subject E was
that the criteria of autism were met, but the presentation was
atypical compared with idiopathic autism.

By ADOS, the most frequent deﬁcits in communication were
speech abnormalities (intonation, volume, rhythm, rate) (n=5),
limited inquiry into the thoughts, feelings, or experiences of
others (n=5), and limited sharing of information about oneself
(n=6). The most frequent deﬁcits in reciprocal social interaction
were poor recognition of other people’s emotions (n=5) and
insight into typical social relationships (n=5). Most subjects
(n=5) had deﬁcits in the imaginative use of objects or verbal
descriptions.

DISCUSSION
In the ﬁrst study assessing a large cohort with germline muta-
tions across the Ras/MAPK pathway, we demonstrate that
RASopathy subjects have signiﬁcant social impairment compared
with sibling controls using two parent-questionnaire measures.
Similar studies have been recently performed for subjects with
NF1 using the SRS.22 23 We have expanded upon their approach
by including a binary classiﬁer questionnaire (SCQ), clinical
observation of several subjects, and comparison with related
RASopathies as well as sibling controls and idiopathic ASDs.
However, our results by SRS for NF1 were consistent with these
recent reports: the mean SRS score for the NF1 sample in both
published studies was approximately 60, and about 30%
received clinically relevant scores between 60 and 75. In our
NF1 sample (n=78),
the mean T-score was 57, and 30%
received a score between 60 and 75. In our study, 12.8%
received scores of 75 and above. In the Walsh et al22 study, 13%

of the NF1 subjects (n=62) had scores of 75 and above, while
Garg et al23 (n=109) had a higher proportion (29%) of NF1
subjects who scored within this severe range.

We observed that the fraction of clinically signiﬁcant impair-
ment varies across the RASopathies, with CFC showing the
highest proportion of affected individuals and NF1 showing
the lowest. Interestingly, autism traits do not track simply with the
level of cognitive impairment by disorder. Only 6–7% of NF1
patients and 17% of NS patients have mild cognitive impair-
ment,26 71 while there is 30% mild impairment and 50%
moderate-severe impairment in CS, and 24% mild and 70%
moderate-severe impairment in CFC.27 28 In our dataset, NS
showed autism traits as severe as CS. Interestingly, NS and CFC
had the highest levels of autistic traits by SRS, and the genes asso-
ciated with these disorders span the entire Ras/MAPK pathway.

Social responsiveness varies within each of these highly pene-
trant disorders. Some individuals affected with each of these
dominant disorders show typical levels of social responsiveness,
while others show a social proﬁle indistinguishable from idio-
pathic ASDs. The distribution of autism traits, as measured by
the SRS, appears to be normal with a shifted mean for CFC and
CS. For NF1 and NS, the distributions appear to have an
increased variance but are not strictly bimodal. This could
reﬂect underlying RASopathy mutational (and thus biochemical)
heterogeneity, or could be inﬂuenced by other factors. Notably,
the CS subjects had the lowest variance in SRS scores when
compared to other RASopathies, and they also have the most

homogeneity in primary CS mutation, with two neighbouring
amino acid substitutions affecting the same protein accounting
for nearly all known mutations (over 75% of subjects). An
important future direction will be to assess whether speciﬁc
mutation-phenotype relationships can explain any of the within-
disorder variance.

Interestingly, although RASopathies affect males and females
equally, autism traits in RASopathy probands (but not unaffected
siblings) were more evident in males. This, along with possible
sibling correlation (below), may suggest that a RASopathy muta-
tion is strongly sensitising, but autism traits are otherwise deter-
mined similarly to the general population where males show
much higher prevalence of autism compared with females.

Subjects with NF1 and CFC (and more modestly, CS) showed
correlation in social responsiveness with RASopathy-unaffected
siblings at a level consistent with the general population,
although these correlations were not highly signiﬁcant and
could be inﬂuenced by outliers. Correlation could suggest that
apart from a main effect of the RASopathy mutation, back-
ground genetic variation may be important in variability within
disorder. An alternative explanation is that the parent raters
who scored both siblings show a similar bias in evaluating both
children, although the difference between mean scores
in
affected and unaffected siblings was highly signiﬁcant. Previous
research in autism families shows that, in fact, the opposite is
often true, that parents show a contrast bias in differentiating
their children which could minimise sibling correlation.72

However, we do not see evidence for sibling correlation in
NS when all probands are included, driven by the probands
scoring above average for their RASopathy group. This, in con-
junction with lack of sex-bias, potentially indicates a truly epi-
static mechanism determining
cognitive
impairment within NS and generating bimodality. An alternative
explanation is that the clinical syndrome in this case is not the
appropriate classiﬁcation if different genetic mechanisms (eg,
upstream vs downstream mutations) have vastly different main
effects that we have not accounted for since we lack mutation
information on a large proportion of our sample.

severe

social

Upon clinical evaluation, four out of six subjects with high
scores on parent questionnaires scored in the ASD range on the
gold standard autism diagnostic observation, although clinical
impression was not always of ‘typical’ autism. By contrast, we
found the larger population of RASopathy subjects and idio-
pathic ASD subjects who scored above threshold on the SCQ
showed indistinguishable subscale proﬁles on the SRS by PCA,
suggesting that the high RASopathy scores were not driven by
unequal domains of impairment or other factors, such as cogni-
tive or attentional impairment. This analysis also suggested that
there is not
signiﬁcantly more symptom homogeneity in
RASopathies compared with idiopathic heterogeneous ASDs.
Future study including additional measurements characterising a
developmental proﬁle of change over time would be useful. We
found in this small sample that SRS score in the ‘severe’ range
and SCQ>15 were good predictors of gold-standard instrument
in-person research criteria.

This systematic study offers empirical support that autism traits
are associated with developmental Ras/MAPK pathway dysregula-
tion. It suggests that individuals affected by RASopathies should be
evaluated for social communication challenges and offered treat-
ment in these areas. This is the ﬁrst strong evidence that multiple
members of a well-deﬁned biochemical pathway can contribute to
autism traits. Future studies could explore potential modifying or
epistatic factors contributing to variation within the RASopathies
and the role of Ras/MAPK activation in idiopathic ASDs.
