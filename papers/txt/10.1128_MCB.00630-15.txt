p21-activated kinases (Paks) have been shown to regulate cytoskeleton rearrangements, cell proliferation, attachment, and mi-
gration in a variety of cellular contexts, including endothelial cells. However, the role of endothelial Pak in embryo development
has not been reported, and currently, there is no consensus on the endothelial function of individual Pak isoforms, in particular
p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2), the main Pak isoform expressed in endothelial cells. In this work, we employ genetic and molecu-
lar studies that show that Pak2, but not Pak1, is a critical mediator of development and maintenance of endothelial cell function.
Endothelial depletion of Pak2 leads to early embryo lethality due to ﬂawed blood vessel formation in the embryo body and yolk
sac. In adult endothelial cells, Pak2 depletion leads to severe apoptosis and acute angiogenesis defects, and in adult mice, endo-
thelial Pak2 deletion leads to increased vascular permeability. Furthermore, ubiquitous Pak2 deletion is lethal in adult mice. We
show that many of these defects are mediated through a newly unveiled Pak2/Bmk1 pathway. Our results demonstrate that en-
dothelial Pak2 is essential during embryogenesis and also for adult blood vessel maintenance, and they also pinpoint the Bmk1/
Erk5 pathway as a critical mediator of endothelial Pak2 signaling.

The p21-activated kinases (Paks) are evolutionarily conserved

serine/threonine kinases that act downstream of the Rho fam-
ily GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42, to regulate numerous cellular pro-
cesses. p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) to Pak3, the group I Paks, are
expressed in numerous tissues with Pak1 being predominantly
expressed in brain, muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and thyroid and
Pak3 being predominantly expressed in brain (1, 2). Compared to
the more restricted expression of Pak1 and Pak3, Pak2 is ubiqui-
tously expressed (3–9). Group I Pak family members share a high
degree of homology (3), but they may play distinct roles as ob-
served by the signiﬁcantly different phenotypes of knockout (KO)
animal models. While Pak1 KO and Pak3 KO mice are viable (10,
11), Pak2 KO mice are embryonic lethal at embryonic day 8.5
(E8.5) due to multiple developmental abnormalities, including
cardiovascular defects (12).

The role of Pak in endothelial cell (EC) signaling has been
studied in animal models (5, 13) and cultured cells (6, 10, 14,
15). Pak signaling is critical in regulating EC attachment, mi-
gration, and lumen formation (4-9). Furthermore, Paks have
been implicated in maintaining the integrity of the endothelial
barrier, but conﬂicting data implicate various Pak isoforms as
both positive and negative regulators of maintaining barrier
function (5, 13, 14, 16).

A few in vivo studies have speciﬁcally implicated Pak2 in vas-
cular pathways. A study in Danio rerio showed that pak2a, one of
two Pak2 orthologs in this organism, plays an important role in
cerebral vascular maintenance (5). In this study, chemical mu-
tagenesis of the pak2a gene and pak2a-targeting morpholinos
caused cerebral hemorrhage, implicating this Pak family member
in vascular barrier maintenance. In mice, germ line deletion of
Pak2 is embryonic lethal, and embryos display a phenotype that is
consistent with vascular defects (12). While these studies suggest
that Pak2 may have an essential role in the vasculature, they do not
address the endothelial autonomous function of Pak2, since they
relied on global Pak2 deletion in the organism.

To study the role of Pak2 in EC signaling in vivo, we generated

temporal and tissue-speciﬁc conditional Pak2 KO mice. In this
article, we present data that suggests that endothelial Pak2 expres-
sion is a critical requirement for embryo viability and morpho-
genesis of embryonic and extraembryonic vasculature. In adult
mice, inducible endothelial Pak2 KO causes an increase in vascu-
lar leaks in the lung and skin. In vitro studies using primary mouse
and human ECs show that Pak2 is required for normal cell prolif-
eration, attachment, migration, and sprouting. Pak2 deletion in
ECs is underlined by severe cytoskeletal rearrangements as well as
by abnormal signaling through Bmk1/Erk5, also known as mito-
gen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7), and these defects can be
partly suppressed by expression of activated Mek5. Our data show
that Pak2 is essential during developmental angiogenesis and also
for mature vessel homeostasis and reveal an unexpected link be-
tween Pak2 signaling and the Bmk1/Erk5 pathway.

from Erica Golemis, Fox Chase Cancer Center, and VEC-CreERT2 mice
were obtained from Luisa Iruela-Arispe, University of California at Los
Angeles (UCLA) (17). Pak1 knockout (KO) mice have been previously
described (10). Pak2ﬂ/wt mice were bred for more than 10 generations to
C57BL/6J mice to obtain pure Pak2ﬂ/⫹ mice with C57BL/6J background.
CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/wt mice were backcrossed for more than 5 generations to
the Pak2ﬂ/⫹ mice with C57BL/6J background. The VEC-CreERT2 mice
were crossed with Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice for more than 3 generations. All mice used
for experiments had dark brown or black fur color. All mice used for
experiments were between 8 to 12 weeks old.

Conditional gene targeting of Pak2. Two similar Pak2 targeting vec-
tors were designed in our laboratories each with Pak2 exon 2 ﬂanked by a
5= loxP site and a 3= loxP site (Fig. 1A). A neomycin resistance gene was
inserted between two Frt sites 3= to the Pak2 exon 2 but 5= to the 3= loxP
site. Detailed information about the constructs is available upon request.
Embryonic stem (ES) cells were transfected with the targeting vector,
selected with neomycin, and genotyped using primers shown in Table S1
in the supplemental material. Targeted ES cells were injected into
C57BL/6J blastocysts to produce chimeras, and chimeras were bred to
identify mice with germ line transmission of the ﬂoxed allele. The neomy-
cin cassette was either removed at this point by crossing the Pak2 ﬂoxed
mice with B/bSJL.Tg mice or before blastocyst injection by electroporat-
ing ES cells with Flp recombinase. The pups were named Pak2ﬂ/⫹ and
crossed with Tie2-Cre, CreERT2, and VECadherin-CreERT2 (VEC-CreERT2)
mice to obtain Tie2-Cre; Pak2ﬂ/wt mice, CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/wt mice, and
VEC-CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/wt mice. These mice were then crossed with
Pak2ﬂ/wt or Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice to obtain Tie2-Cre; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice, CreERT2;
Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice, and VEC-CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice. The Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice cre-
ated at Fox Chase Cancer Center and Genentech yielded indistinguish-
able results.

Histology. Freshly dissected embryos and tissues from adult mice
were formalin ﬁxed, embedded in parafﬁn blocks for sectioning, and
mounted onto glass slides. For whole-mount immunostaining, embryos
and yolk sacs were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (TX100),
blocked in PBS containing 0.1% TX100 and 2% bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and incubated with unconjugated or ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated rat anti-CD31, Ki67, or cleaved caspase 3 (see Table S2
in the supplemental material). Yolk sacs were washed extensively and then
mounted ﬂat on glass slides in a drop of glycerol and imaged using a Nikon
Tie-E ﬂuorescence microscope. At least ﬁve embryos were stained and
imaged per condition and per genotype.

MLEC isolation and culture. All mice used for mouse lung endothe-
lial cell (MLEC) isolation were culled by cervical dislocation. The lungs
were collected immediately and transferred to prechilled 50-ml conical
tubes containing 30 ml endothelial cell growth medium (EGM). The lungs
were minced for approximately 5 min with sharp scissors in pieces smaller
than 1 mm3 and digested with 1 ml collagenase (1 mg/ml, 37°C, 1 h). Ten
milliliters of EGM was added to the digested tissue, and it was pipetted up
and down 10 times to separate the cells. The digested tissue was then
passed through a cell strainer with 70-␮m pores. The individual cell mix-
ture was centrifuged, resuspended in EGM, and plated on ﬁbronectin/
collagen-coated plates. Forty-eight hours later, the medium was removed,
cells were washed with PBS 3 times, and labeled for EC isolation. EC
isolation was performed as previously described (18). Four milliliters of
EGM containing 40 ␮g DilAcLDL (acetylated low-density lipoprotein la-
beled with 1,1=-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3=-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine per-
chlorate) (Biomedical Technologies) was added to the cells for 4 h at 37°C.
The cells were then trypsinized, sorted by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sort-
ing (FACS), and cultured in complete EGM on ﬁbronectin/collagen-
coated plates. The cells maintained their characteristics for 5 to 8 passages.
MLEC culture plates were coated with 2 ml/100-mm dish of coating so-
lution (collagen I [25 ␮g/ml], ﬁbronectin [5 ␮g/ml], and BSA [100 ␮g/ml]
in double-distilled water). The coating solution was spread on the plate,

Pak2 Regulates Vascular Development and Function

and the plates were incubated at 37°C overnight. The following day, the
plates were washed at least 3 times with PBS and stored at 4°C.

To delete the Pak2 gene, MLECs were treated for 48 h with 1 ␮M
4-OH-tamoxifen (4-OHTx) and then cultured in medium without
4-OHTx for at least 48 h before being used for assays.

Pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pur-
chased from Lonza (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in complete EGM2
(Lonza, Walkersville, MD) for a maximum of six passages. HUVECs were
transfected with individual SilencerSelect (Life Technologies) Pak2 and
nontargeting control (ctl) small interfering RNA (siRNAs) using Lipo-
fectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies). siRNA sequences are shown in
Table S3 in the supplemental material. Transfected HUVECs were used
for experiments 24 to 72 h after transfection.

Immunoﬂuorescence. HUVECs were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 20 min and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5
min. The cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked for 1 h in
PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.1% TX100. The cells were incubated with
primary antibodies for 1.5 h at 22°C, washed three times with PBS con-
taining 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with secondary antibodies for
45 min. The cells were washed extensively with PBS and mounted in
Prolong Gold with 4=,6=-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Antibody
details are provided in Table S2 in the supplemental material.

Embryo body size measurement. Embryo pictures were taken with an
Evos microscope at a magniﬁcation of ⫻40. The area corresponding to the
whole embryo body was measured using ImageJ software. The highest
area value for the embryo body was used for normalization.

Tamoxifen dosing. Eight- to 12-week-old mice received 80 to 100 mg
of 4OHTx/kg of body weight by oral gavage for 5 consecutive days. For
oral gavage, 4-OHTx was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 50
mg/ml and then diluted with corn oil (Sigma) to a ﬁnal concentration of
10 or 20 mg/ml.

Adenovirus infection of primary MLEC. Adenovirus expressing
wild-type Pak2 (WT-Pak2) (Adeno-Pak2) was a generous gift from
George E. Davis, University of Missouri. Adenovirus expressing constitu-
tively active Mek (Mek-CA) (Adeno-Mek-CA) was a generous gift from
Jun-Ichi Abe, University of Rochester Medical Center. MLECs were in-
fected with Adeno-Pak2 or Adeno-Mek-CA for 12 h and used for exper-
iments 24 to 96 h after infection.

Western blotting. Protein cell lysates were obtained by lysing MLECs
in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA,
0.1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitor cocktail (catalog no. P8340;
Sigma). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method,
and 20 ␮g total protein was run on a 4 to 20%gradient gel (Bio-Rad). The
proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was
blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk. Antibody information is presented in
Table S2 in the supplemental material.

Proliferation and apoptosis assays. For the proliferation assay, the
MLECs were plated at a concentration of 105 cells/ml. The cells were
stained with trypan blue and counted every day for 8 consecutive days. For
the apoptosis assay, the MLECs were treated with 4OHTx for 4 days and
further cultured without 4OHTx for 5 to 8 days. The 4OHTx-treated
CreERT2; Pak2wt/wt or CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ MLECs were incubated with
Guava Nexin reagent (Millipore) for 30 min following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Annexin V staining was assessed with a Guava EasyCyte instru-
ment (Millipore).

Adhesion assay. For the adhesion assay, MLECs were plated on E-
plates (ACEA Biosciences). E-plates are single-use, disposable devices
used for performing cell-based assays on the xCELLigence system. Each
individual well on an E-plate incorporates a sensor electrode array that
allows cells in the well to be monitored and assayed. E-plates were coated
for MLEC cultures as described above. The day of the experiment, MLECs
were trypsinized and 5,000 cells were plated in 100 ␮l EGM. Attachment
was assessed as cell index every 15 min with a real-time cell analyzer
(RTCA) dual-plate (DP) instrument. Cell index is a measure of both cell

number and the surface occupied by each individual cell. The experiments
were performed in triplicate and repeated three times.

Migration assay. For the migration assay, MLECs were plated in the
top chamber of a CIM-plate (CIM stands for cell invasion/migration).
CIM-plates 16 are single-use, disposable devices used for performing cell
invasion and cell migration assays on the RTCA DP instrument. The
CIM-plate 16 comprises a plate cover (lid), an top chamber, and a bottom
chamber. The top chamber has 16 wells that are sealed at the bottom with
a microporous polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane containing
microfabricated gold electrode arrays on the bottom side of the mem-
brane. The median pore size of this membrane is 8 ␮m. The bottom
chamber has 16 wells, each of which serves as a reservoir for medium and
any chemoattractant for the cells in the corresponding top chamber wells.
MLECs were starved overnight in endothelial basal medium (EBM). The
next day, 10,000 cells in 100 ␮l EBM were added to the top chamber of the
CIM-plate. The bottom chamber contained 150 ␮l EBM with 10% fetal
bovine serum. Migration toward serum was monitored as cell index every
30 min for 36 h.

Wound healing assay. MLECs treated with 4OHTx or not treated
with 4OHTx were plated to conﬂuence on six-well plates and cultured for
24 h. A scratch was made with a 1-ml pipette tip, the detached cells were
removed by washing with warm medium, and then medium was readded
to the wells. Pictures of the scratch were taken at different time points over
24 h. The experiment was repeated more than three times, and each time
it was performed in triplicate.

HUVECs were transfected with siRNAs and plated to conﬂuence in an
Essen ImageLock 96-well plate (Essen BioScience, Ann Arbor, MI) 24 h
later. After overnight incubation, the monolayers were wounded with a
WoundMaker device (Essen BioSciences, Ann Arbor, MI), and detached
cells were removed by gently washing the cells 3 times with warm medium.
After the ﬁnal wash, EBM2 with 0.2% fetal calf serum (FCS) with or
without 50 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (R&D Sys-
tems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to the wells. Images were collected
and quantiﬁed ever y 4 h in anIncucyte microscope (Essen BioScience,
Ann Arbor, MI).

Two-dimensional (2D) network formation assay. ECMatrix from
angiogenesis assay kit (Millipore) was thawed at 4°C overnight. One hun-
dred microliters of thawed Matrigel was plated per well in a 96-well plate
and allowed to solidify at 37°C for 1 h.

A total of 10,000 MLECs were plated per well on the solidiﬁed matrix
according to the angiogenesis assay kit protocol (Millipore) in 200 ␮l
EGM. HUVECs (10,000/well) were plated on 50 ␮l of freshly solidiﬁed
growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) (⬃30 min, 37°C) in a
96-well plate, and 150 ␮l EBM2 containing 0.5% FCS supplemented with
50 ng/ml basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Roche) was added to each
well. EC tubes and networks were imaged 8 h (MLECs) or 16 h (HUVECs)
after plating and quantiﬁed following the guidelines in the angiogenesis
assay kit. A numeric value was attributed to the network pattern observed
in each well as follows: 5, complex mesh-like structures develop; 4, closed
polygons begin to form; 3, sprouting of new capillary tubes visible; 2,
capillary tubes visible and no sprouting; 1, cell begin to migrate and align
themselves; 0, individual cells that are well separated. Experiments were
repeated at least 3 times, in triplicate.

Fibrin bead assay. MLECs and HUVECs were incubated with Cyto-
dex3 beads (19) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) at a con-
centration of 400 cells/beads. Cells and beads were incubated at 37°C for 4
h with gentle agitation every 20 min. Cell-covered beads were transferred
to a 25-cm2 ﬂask and left at 37°C overnight. The next day, HUVECs were
transfected and incubated with siRNAs for 6 h in a25-cm 2 ﬂask. MLECs
and HUVECs were washed 3 times with growth medium and resuspended
at a concentration of 200 beads/ml in 2.5 mg/ml ﬁbrinogen (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) with 0.15 U/ml aprotinin (Sigma). Fibrinogen-bead solution
(500 ␮l) was transferred to a well in a 12-well plate, and 0.6 U thrombin
was added. The ﬁbrin clot was allowed to solidify for 20 min at 37°C. After
the clot solidiﬁed, 20,000 human skin ﬁbroblasts were plated on top of the

Pak2 Regulates Vascular Development and Function

ﬁbrin clot, and 1 ml EC growth medium was added to the clot and incu-
bated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2. Fresh complete EGM was added
every other day for up to 8 days. Single and time-lapse images were ac-
quired using a Nikon phase-contrast microscope equipped with an envi-
ronmental chamber. Individual MLEC and HUVEC sprouts were mea-
sured with ImageJ software.

Miles assay. A Miles assay was performed to measure endothelial cell
permeability (20). VEC-CreERT2 mice or VEC-CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ or Pak1
KO mice received intraperitoneal injections with 80 mg/kg 4OHTx daily
for 5 consecutive days. There were at least three mice per genotype per
experiment. The experiment was repeated 3 times. Two weeks after the
ﬁrst injection, the Miles assay was performed as previously described (20).
Speciﬁcally, 200 ␮l of 0.5% solution of Evans blue in sterile PBS solution
was injected in the tail veins of 8- to 12-week-old mice. The mice were
observed for 30 min after which the mice were sacriﬁced by cervical dis-
location. Representative pictures were taken, and organs of interest were
collected in prechilled tubes. One of the lungs from each mouse was col-
lected in EGM and used for EC isolation and conﬁrmation of gene dele-
tion. Pieces from different organs were weighed in separate tubes, and
then Evans blue was extracted from these tissues in 500 ␮l formamide
overnight at 55°C. Extracted Evans blue was quantiﬁed by measuring
absorbance at 600 nm. The data (in nanograms of Evans blue extravasated
per milligram of tissue) were plotted.

Aortic ring assay. Mice treated with 4-OHTx were sacriﬁced by cer-
vical dislocation, and the thoracic aorta was isolated and transferred to
ice-cold EGM. The periaortic ﬁbroadipose tissue was carefully removed,
and aortic rings with a width of 1 mm were cut and embedded in 150 ␮l
Matrigel. The gel was covered with 1 ml of EGM, and blood vessel sprout-
ing was monitored over a period of 15 days.

In vitro permeability assay. HUVECs and MLECs were plated to
conﬂuence for 24 to 48 h on 0.4- or 1-␮m Transwell inserts (Millipore) in
triplicate on a 24-well plate. Either 40 mg/ml trypan blue and 1.8 mg/ml
BSA in HBBS buffer (8 g/liter NaCl, 0.14 g/liter CaCl2, 0.1 g/liter
MgSO4·7H2O, 0.4 g/liter KCl, 0.1 g MgCl2·6H2O, 0.06 g/liter KH2PO4, 1
g/liter D-glucose, 0.06 g/liter Na2HPO4·2H2O) or 2 mg/ml FITC-dextran
(Sigma) in EGM2 was added to the top chamber of the insert. The absor-
bance of trypan blue (600 nm) or the ﬂuorescence of FITC-dextran con-
tained in the bottom chamber was measured over or after 60 min.

Statistical analysis. All graphs were created using Prism or Excel soft-
ware. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test, and P values
of ⬍0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Study approval. All studies were done in concordance with protocols
approved by the Fox Chase Cancer Center Animal Facility or the Genen-
tech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse colonies
maintained at Genentech were housed in a barrier facility, and their care
conformed with California state legal and ethical standards of animal care.

RESULTS
Endothelium-speciﬁc deletion of Pak2 results in early embryo
lethality. Group I Paks are known to modulate vascular signaling
in cultured ECs (14, 15, 21) and in multiple animal models (5, 13).
In mice, homozygous Pak2 KO causes embryonic lethality at E8.5
due to multiple development abnormalities, including cardiovas-
cular defects (12). Due to the vascular phenotype observed in the
Pak2 KO mice, we decided to investigate whether Pak2 is essential
in vascular ECs during development. In order to allow temporal
and tissue-speciﬁc control of the Pak2 gene, we inserted loxP sites
ﬂanking the ﬁrst coding exon (exon 2) of the Pak2 gene (Fig. 1A).
We assessed Pak2wt/wt, Pakﬂ/wt, and Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mouse genotypes by
using PCR (Fig. 1B; see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice were viable, fertile, and indistinguishable from
Pak2ﬂ/⫹ and Pak2wt/wt mice.

We crossed Pak2-ﬂoxed mice with the Tie2-Cre transgenic
mouse line in order to drive recombination at the ﬂoxed Pak2

pups should have a Tie2-Cre; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ genotype; however, no Tie2-
Cre; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ (ePak2 KO) pups were observed among ⬎200 pups.
This observation strongly suggests that Pak2 deletion in ECs is
embryonic lethal.

Endothelial Pak2 deletion leads to defects in cardiovascular
development. To recover Tie2-Cre; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ embryos, we set up
timed matings between Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice (females) and Tie2-Cre;
Pak2ﬂ/wt mice (males), harvested embryos at various gestational
stages, and used a small yolk sac clipping for genotyping. At E10.5
days postfertilization, we did not observe any ePak2 KO embryos
(n ⫽ 50 embryos). At E9.5, embryos containing at least one Pak2
allele had developed circulation with visible cerebral vasculariza-
tion as well as a clearly formed dorsal aorta (Fig. 1C and F, top
panels). In contrast, all of the ePak2 KO embryos showed various
levels of growth and developmental retardation and defective vas-
cularization (Fig. 1C and F, bottom panels). Some embryos pre-
sented a more moderate phenotype; these embryos were smaller,
but the phenotype appeared at a similar gestational age (Fig. 1F,
bottom left panel). The embryos with the most severe phenotypes
had not turned and displayed an open neural tube and appeared
degraded (Fig. 1C, right panel, and F, bottom right panel). ePak2
KO embryos displayed various levels of pericardial edema (Fig.
1C, arrow), which is indicative of cardiac dysfunction. Tie2-Cre;
Pak2ﬂ/wt embryos did not have gross cardiovascular defects, but
they were ⬃25% slightly smaller than Tie2-Cre; Pak2wt/wt embryos
(Fig. 1D and F, top right panel).

By E9.5, yolk sacs from Tie2-Cre; Pak2wt/wt embryos have well-
deﬁned blood vessels that branch throughout the sac (Fig. 1E, left
panel, and G, top left panel). Similar to the embryo body, the yolk
sacs from ePak2 KO embryos were pale, and the prominent vitell-
ine vessel and smaller branched vessels were absent (Fig. 1E, right
panel, and G, bottom panels).

E9.5 embryos were ﬁxed, sectioned in the sagittal plane, and
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained (Fig. 2A). Examination of
the developing hearts in these embryos showed areas of a contin-
uous endocardial layer in Tie2-Cre; Pak2ﬂ/wt embryos (n ⫽ 11)
and Tie2-Cre; Pak2wt/wt embryos (n ⫽ 4) (Fig. 2A, arrow). In con-
trast, in ePak2 KO hearts, the endocardial layer was not visible or
appeared largely disrupted in 85% of the ePak2 KO embryos ex-
amined (n ⫽ 12) (Fig. 2A, arrow). In addition, the myocardium
appeared impaired with fewer areas of trabecula initiation (Fig.
2A, arrowhead).

To further study the developmental state of blood vessels in
ePak2 KO embryos, we immunostained whole embryos with a
CD31 antibody. Tie2-Cre; Pak2wt/wt embryos presented with a
well-formed dorsal aorta with distinct intersomitic branches that
coalesce to form a complex microcapillary network (Fig. 2B).
ePak2 KO embryos display a dorsal aorta that branched out into
intersomitic blood vessels; however, the intersomitic branches are
dilated and shorter and do not form a microcapillary network
(Fig. 2B, magniﬁed panels). In sagittal sections of CD31-stained
E9.5 ePak2 KO embryos, the dorsal aorta presented with areas of
collapse and dilation (Fig. 2C). These blood vessels were also de-
void of red blood cells (Fig. 2C, magniﬁed panels), explaining our
inability to directly visualize the vasculature.

CD31-stained yolk sacs from E9.5 ePak2 KO embryos showed
severely inhibited vascular remodeling compared to yolk sacs
from Tie2-Cre; Pak2wt/wt embryos. The yolk sacs from the Tie2-
Cre; Pak2wt/wt embryos showed remodeled branched vessels inter-

spersed in the surrounding vascular plexus (Fig. 2D). The yolk sac
vessels from ePak2 KO embryos were dilated compared to blood
vessels from Tie2-Cre; Pak2wt/wt yolk sacs (Fig. 2E).

In line with our observation that endothelial deletion of Pak2 is
embryonic lethal, ePak2 KO sagittal sections showed focal areas of
cleaved caspase 3 in embryos with a moderate phenotype and
more widespread cleaved caspase 3 immunostaining in embryos
with a severe phenotype (Fig. 2F). These areas of increased apop-
tosis are mirrored by areas of decreased cell proliferation, as mea-
sured by Ki67 staining (Fig. 2F).

Pak2 depletion inhibits proliferation and survival of ECs. In
order to obtain Pak2 KO MLECs (mouse lung endothelial cells)
for in vitro studies, we crossed the Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mouse with B6.Cg-
Tg(Plp1-cre/ESR1)3Pop/J mouse that has a tamoxifen-inducible
Cre-mediated recombination system. MLECs were isolated from
CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice, cultured, and treated with 4-OHTx to spe-
ciﬁcally deplete Pak2 in vitro (Fig. 3A). We measured cell prolif-
eration of Pak2 KO MLECs (CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ MLECs with
4-OHTx exposure) and wild-type (WT) MLECs (CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ
MLECs without 4-OHTx exposure) over 8 days, and trypan
blue-stained cells were directly counted. After 8 days, an ⬃3.5-
fold reduction in cell proliferation was observed in Pak2 KO
MLECs compared to control MLECs (Fig. 3A, circles). Similar
results were observed in proliferation assays that compared Pak2
KO MLECs with 4-OHTx-treated CreERT2; Pak2wt/wt MLECs
(data not shown). Since tamoxifen treatment has been shown to
reduce secreted VEGF levels in medium (22), we treated both
control and Pak2 KO MLECs with saturating levels of VEGF. As
expected, we observed a VEGF-dependent increase in the growth
of control MLECs, while the Pak2 KO MLECs still exhibited an
⬃3.5-fold reduction in cell number (Fig. 3A, squares). Similar
results were also observed in proliferation assays with HUVECs
transfected with Pak2-speciﬁc siRNAs, which showed a 2- to
3-fold reduction in cell proliferation (Fig. 3B).

Next, we determined whether Pak2 deletion induces apoptosis in
MLECs. Pak2 KO MLECs showed an ⬃5-fold increase in annexin V
staining relative to control MLECs, indicating that Pak2 depletion
results in an increase in apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Consistent with this ﬁnd-
ing, Pak2 KO MLECs showed decreased levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl2
and increased cleaved caspase 3 levels (Fig. 3C, right panels). We next
tested whether Pak2 KO in MLECs affects cell cycle progression. Pak2
KO in MLECs did not affect the percentage of G2/M- and S-phase
cells, suggesting that Pak2 does not signiﬁcantly regulate progression
through the cell cycle (data not shown).

Pak2-deﬁcient ECs have impaired adhesion and migration.
EC attachment and migration are essential events for angiogenesis
(23), and several members of the Pak family have been reported to
regulate these processes in a variety of cell types (14, 24). Due to
these previous observations and to the fact that Pak2 depletion
leads to an increase in apoptosis in MLECs (Fig. 3C), we investi-
gated whether depletion of Pak2 affects EC adhesion and migra-
tion. WT MLECs and Pak2 KO MLECs were plated on E-plates,
and the cell index was monitored in a xCELLigence system (Fig.
3D). At early time points, Pak2 KO MLECs had a smaller cell index
than WT MLECs did, suggesting deﬁcient attachment. Pak2 KO
cells reached the same cell index as WT cells did 6 h after plating
but fell behind again after 24 h (Fig. 3D, top panel). Since the cell
index is also a measure of cell number, it is possible that the
smaller cell index of Pak2 KO MLECs at time points later than 48
h is due to slower proliferation of Pak2 KO MLECs (Fig. 3A).

examples of ePak2 KO embryos show the typical variation observed at this gestational stage. Circled areas indicate increased apoptosis (left panels) and decreased
cell proliferation (right panels).

Interestingly, when MLECs were plated on electrodes that have
not been previously coated with ﬁbronectin/collagen, Pak2 KO
cells had a lower cell index at all time points compared to WT
MLECs (Fig. 3D, bottom panel). This suggests that for attachment

purposes, Pak2 deletion can be partially overcome in the presence
of an extracellular matrix, but Pak2 is essential in its absence.

Next, we determined whether depletion of Pak2 affects endo-
thelial motility using chemotaxis and wound healing assays. First,

we assessed the role of Pak2 in chemotactic migration toward 10%
serum. WT MLECs and Pak2 KO MLECs were plated on CIM-16
plates. Medium containing 10% serum or vehicle was added to the
bottom chamber, and the cell index was monitored for 33 h in a
xCELLigence system. We observed a signiﬁcant reduction in the rate
of chemotactic migration toward 10% serum (Fig. 3E). In wound
healing migration assays, a uniform scratch was introduced into
MLEC and HUVEC monolayers, and closure of the wound was mon-
itored at different time points using a phase-contrast microscope (0-
and 24-h time points shown in Fig. 3F). Pak2 KO MLECs and Pak2
knockdown (KD) HUVECs showed considerably lower directional
migration rates compared to those of WT MLECs and HUVECs
transfected with control siRNA, and this resulted in an inability to
close the wounded area in 24 h (Fig. 3F). Together, these data indicate
that endothelial Pak2 is critical for efﬁcient cell migration.

Sprouting and lumen formation are inhibited in Pak2-de-
pleted ECs. We performed a simple 2D tubule formation assay on
Matrigel. MLECs (top panels) and HUVECs (bottom panels) were
plated on top of Matrigel and imaged after 8 and 16 h, respectively
(Fig. 4A). WT MLECs and HUVECs transfected with control
siRNAs aligned, sprouted, and formed interconnected networks.
Similarly, Pak1 KO MLECs were able to form complex network
structures, indistinguishable from WT ECs. Pak2 deletion resulted
in a reduction in tubule formation (2.5-fold in MLECs and 2-fold
in HUVECs). We also observed a severe reduction in tubule for-
mation in HUVECs treated with a pan-Pak inhibitor (data not
shown). Expression of exogenous Pak2 in MLECs partially re-
stored tubule formation in Pak2 KO MLECs (Fig. 4A).

Next, we used a three-dimensional (3D) in vitro angiogenesis
assay that recapitulates several processes required for in vivo
angiogenesis, including cell proliferation, extracellular matrix
(ECM) digestion/remodeling, migration, branch formation, lu-
men formation, and anastomization (25). MLEC- and HUVEC-
covered Cytodex3 beads were embedded in a ﬁbrin clot and mon-
itored for 5 to 8 days. We observed robust sprout and lumen
formation with WT MLECs and HUVECs transfected with con-
trol siRNAs (Fig. 4B), and Pak1 KO MLECs sprouted and formed
tubules similar to WT MLECs. Pak2 KO and KD in ECs robustly
inhibited sprout formation. The number of sprouts per bead was
reduced 2.3-fold in Pak2 KO MLECs and 3-fold in Pak2 KD
HUVECs, and the sprout length was reduced 5.1-fold in Pak2 KO
MLECs and 2.5-fold in Pak2 KD HUVECs. Importantly, infection
of Pak2 KO MLECs with Pak2-expressing adenovirus partially
restored sprout formation (Fig. 4B). From time-lapse images of
sprout formation, it appears that Pak2 KD inhibits sprouting early
in the sprout initiation phase, and only a few cellular protrusions
are observed in the surrounding matrix (see Movie S1 in the sup-
plemental material).

Last, we tested angiogenesis ex vivo in an aortic ring assay. For this
assay, 1-mm-wide rings of thoracic aorta from CreERT2Pak2wt/wt,
CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ, and Pak1 KO mice treated with 4-OHTx were em-
bedded in Matrigel and monitored for 15 days. Endothelial cells lin-
ing aortic rings from CreERT2 Pak2wt/wt mice sprouted and formed
tube-like structures resembling primordial blood vessels (Fig. 4C,
left magniﬁed panel). We observed robust inhibition of microves-
sel growth from the Pak2-depleted aortas compared to the control
aortas. Pak1 KO aortic rings gave rise to a microvessel network
comparable to control aortic rings (Fig. 4C, middle panels). To-
gether, these data provide further support that Pak2, but not Pak1,
is critical for angiogenesis.

Pak2 Regulates Vascular Development and Function

Pak2 expression is required for endothelial barrier mainte-
nance. The vascular endothelium serves a critical function as a
semipermeable barrier between the intra- and extravascular space,
and Pak proteins have been previously reported to modulate this
barrier function (5, 15). We investigated whether Pak2 contrib-
utes to endothelial barrier integrity in an in vitro permeability
assay. MLECs and HUVECs were plated to conﬂuence on 1- and
0.4-␮m Transwell inserts, respectively. After establishing cell-cell
junctions, we measured the amount of trypan blue-BSA (MLECs)
or FITC-dextran (HUVECs) that extravasated to the opposite side
of the cell monolayer. At 60 min, Pak2 KO and KD resulted in an
⬃2-fold increase in MLEC and HUVEC permeability, indicating
that Pak2 is required for endothelial barrier integrity. Expression
of exogenous Pak2 in MLECs partially restored endothelial mono-
layer barrier function (Fig. 5A).

In order to test vascular permeability in vivo, we used VEC-
CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice that express CreERT2 under the endotheli-
um-speciﬁc VEC promoter. We treated VEC-CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ,
VEC-CreERT2; Pak2wt/wt, and Pak1 KO mice with 4-OHTx for 5
consecutive days. Nine days later, Evans blue solution was injected
into the tail vein, and extravasation of Evans blue into the inter-
stitial tissue was monitored and quantiﬁed 30 min following
injection. In VEC-CreERT; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ mice treated with 4-OHTx
(ePak2 KO), we observed an ⬃3-fold increase in vascular perme-
ability in the lung and skin compared to similarly treated VEC-
CreERT2; Pak2wt/wt and Pak1 KO mice (Fig. 5B and C). Ubiquitous
Pak2 deletion in CreERT2; Pak2ﬂ/ﬂ also resulted in more permeable
endothelium (data not shown). Importantly, ubiquitous Pak2 de-
letion led to adult mouse lethality 40 days (100 mg/kg Tx) or 20
days (200 mg/kg Tx) upon induction of gene deletion (Fig. 4D).
Pak2 regulates cytoskeletal organization and remodeling in
ECs. Next, we investigated potential downstream processes regu-
lated by Pak2 in ECs. First, we examined Pak2’s role in regulating
the cytoskeleton due to the results we observed in our migration,
sprouting, and permeability assays and the well-known role of the
Pak kinase family in regulating a number of cytoskeleton-associ-
ated proteins (7, 26–28). HUVECs were sparsely and densely
plated on ﬁbronectin-coated coverslips and then labeled them
with phalloidin, VE-cadherin (VEC) (conﬂuent cells), or phos-
phorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) antibodies. Sparse control
siRNA-transfected HUVECs typically displayed a prominent la-
mellipodium (Fig. 6A, white arrows), a distinguishable cell polar-
ity, and few stress ﬁbers. The pMLC signal was typically observed
at the sides and back of the cells (Fig. 6B, arrows), with few cells
with centrally localized pMLC (Fig. 6B, asterisks). In contrast,
Pak2 KD HUVECs showed reduced lamellipodial phalloidin
staining, an unpolarized morphology, and prominent stress ﬁbers
traversing the cell (Fig. 6A) that also stained positive for pMLC
(Fig. 6B). In conﬂuent cells, control HUVECs established tight cell
junctions containing VEC (Fig. 6C), and actin ﬁbers localized pre-
dominantly at the cell periphery (Fig. 6D). Conﬂuent monolayers
of HUVECs with Pak2 KD also formed cell-cell contacts, albeit
with a more disorganized pattern (Fig. 6C), but showed an in-
crease in robust stress ﬁbers that typically traversed the entire cell
length (Fig. 6D). A similar reorganization of stress ﬁbers was ob-
served in HUVECs treated with a pan-Pak inhibitor (data not
shown). These data indicate that Pak2 is required for maintaining
normal actomyosin localization in sparse and conﬂuent cells,
which may contribute to the reduced motility and endothelial
barrier integrity we observe in Pak2 KO and KD ECs. To further

investigate the cause of increased permeability, we analyzed the
effect of Pak2 downregulation on adherens junctions by measur-
ing the levels and activity of integrin beta1. We did not observe any
difference in the level or activity of integrin beta1 as measured by
Western blot and FACS analysis (data not shown).

Next, we determined whether Pak2 regulates actin ﬁlament
remodeling using forskolin, a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-elevating agent
that induces cortical actin assembly and increases endothelial bar-
rier integrity (29). For these experiments, we stimulated conﬂuent
HUVECs with vehicle control or forskolin for 20 min and then

In HUVECs transfected with control siRNA and treated with for-
skolin, we observed an increase in ␤-catenin and F-actin orga-
nization into a narrow band at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 6E). In

HUVECs treated with vehicle control, Pak2 localized to the
cytoplasm and punctate structures that localized at the cell
periphery. Stimulation with forskolin induced an increase in
Pak2 localization at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 6E). The nuclear

FIG 6 Pak2 regulates cytoskeletal organization and remodeling. (A) HUVECs were sparsely plated on ﬁbronectin-coated slides, ﬁxed, and stained with
phalloidin and DAPI. (B) Sparsely plated HUVECs were ﬁxed and stained with pMLC antibody and phalloidin. Arrows indicate phosphorylated myosin light
chain (pMLC) enrichment at the sides and back of the cell, and asterisks indicate cells with abundant centrally localized pMLC signal. (C) HUVECs were plated
to conﬂuence on ﬁbronectin-coated slides, ﬁxed, and stained with DAPI and VEC and ␤-catenin antibodies. (D) Conﬂuent HUVECs ﬁxed and stained with
phalloidin. (E) HUVECs were plated to conﬂuence, allowed to form cell-cell junctions, stimulated with vehicle control or 10 ␮M forskolin for 20 min, ﬁxed, and
stained with phalloidin and Pak2 and ␤-catenin antibodies. Images are representative of three independent experiments.

staining with Pak2 antibodies is likely unspeciﬁc background as
this is observed in control and Pak2 KD cells (Fig. 6E, right
bottom panels). In contrast to control HUVECs, Pak2 KD
HUVECs showed reduced cortical F-actin and ␤-catenin re-
modeling, and most cells still contained abundant central stress
ﬁbers (Fig. 6E). These data show that Pak2 increases its junc-
tional localization and modulates cortical F-actin remodeling
in the presence of a barrier-enhancing stimulus.

Pak2 signals through the Bmk1/Erk5 pathway. Pak proteins
have been previously implicated in angiogenesis and maintaining

a healthy endothelial barrier by modulating the MAPK pathway
and several molecules involved in the cell contractile mechanism
(10, 14, 30). While the role of Pak in angiogenesis has been well
established, currently, there is no consensus yet on Pak’s role in
endothelial permeability. After an in-depth research of vascular-
system-related phenotypes of different KO animals, we observed
that Bmk1/Erk5 KO mice and endothelial Bmk1/Erk5 KO mice
have phenotypes similar to those of Pak2 KO and endothelial Pak2
KO mice (31, 32). We therefore hypothesized that in ECs, Pak2
and Bmk1/Erk5 share a signaling pathway.

We studied activation of the Bmk1/Erk5 pathway in Pak2 KO
ECs. Pak2 KO MLECs showed markedly lower levels of phosphor-
ylated Bmk1 (P-Bmk1)/Erk5 upon EGF stimulation. These levels
were partly restored in Pak2 KO MLECs that have been previously
infected with Pak2-expressing adenovirus. Interestingly, phos-
phorylated Erk1/2 (P-Erk1/2) levels were not signiﬁcantly affected
in Pak 2 KO orPak1 KO MLECs, suggesting that Erk1/2 might not
be critical in Pak signaling in ECs (Fig. 7A).

To assess whether Pak2-induced events are mediated through
Mek5/Erk5 signaling in ECs, we overexpressed constitutively ac-
tive (CA) Mek5, the upstream activator of Bmk1/Erk5, in Pak2 KO
MLECs. P-Bmk1/Erk5 levels were restored in Pak2 KO MLECs
infected with CA Mek5-expressing adenovirus (Fig. 7A, Pak2KO⫹
Mek5 lanes). Restoring P-Bmk1/Erk5 levels by CA Mek5 overex-
pression resulted in partial protection from apoptosis in Pak2 KO
cells (Fig. 7B and C). Furthermore, Pak2 KO MLECs infected with
CA Mek5 adenovirus were able to heal the wound better in a
scratch assay than Pak2 KO MLECs were (Fig. 7D). Angiogenesis,
as measured by a 2D network assay, was also partially restored in
Pak2 KO MLECs that overexpress CA Mek5 (Fig. 7E). Similarly,
primary MLECs treated with Frax1036 Pak inhibitor (33) show
decreased levels of P-Bmk1/Erk5. Similar to the results obtained in
Pak2 KO MLECs, overexpression of Mek5CA partially rescued apop-
tosis in MLECs treated with a small-molecule inhibitor of group I
Paks (Fig. 7F). These data suggest that, in ECs, Pak2-mediated cellular
events involve signaling through the Bmk1/Erk5 pathway.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we used Cre-expressing mouse models to delete Pak2
in ECs during development (Tie2-Cre) and in the adult (VEC-
CreERT2). We identiﬁed Pak2 as a critical regulator of EC function
that ultimately controls vascular morphogenesis in the developing
embryo and vessel barrier maintenance in the adult animal.

Due to its well-known role in cell motility, Paks have been
posited to play a signiﬁcant role in angiogenesis. Early studies by
Kiosses et al. showed that a Pak inhibitory peptide inhibited an-
giogenesis in a chick chorioallantoic assay (34). Later genetic stud-
ies showed that Pak2 KO embryos displayed early lethality and
vascular defects, implicating this speciﬁc group I Pak member as
an important regulator in vascular function (12). In this study, we
show that speciﬁc deletion of Pak2 in vascular tissues is associated
with major defects in angiogenic remodeling and cardiac develop-
ment and with lethality at E9.5. In contrast to these ﬁndings, pre-
vious studies showed that deletion of either Pak1 or Pak3 is toler-
ated, and mice lacking either of these genes do not display
signiﬁcant vascular defects (12). These results are consistent with
the fact that Pak2 is the main isoform expressed in ECs (35) and
the idea that Pak1 and Pak2 have distinct and often opposing roles
in mediating various cellular events, as has been suggested by a
number of recent studies (36–38).

In vitro analysis of Pak2 KO MLECs and KD HUVECs demon-
strated that this group I Pak modulates several cellular processes
that are required during angiogenesis, such as cell migration,
sprouting, and proliferation. Previous reports showed that Pak2
and the group II Pak, Pak4, each play a role in endothelial lumen
formation in a 3D collagen matrix (24). In our sprouting assay, we
show that Pak2 regulates early steps during sprout initiation, such
as migration and invasion, which precede lumen formation.

It is probable that the angiogenesis defects are a result of the
severe apoptotic events induced by Pak2 deletion (Fig. 4C and

Pak2 Regulates Vascular Development and Function

7C). The role of Pak2 in protecting from apoptosis has been pre-
viously documented in various cell lines (39–42). In primary
MLECs, expression of constitutively active Mek1 or Mkk4 was not
able to rescue apoptosis or angiogenesis defects initiated by Pak2
deletion (data not shown). However, overexpression of constitu-
tively active Mek5 was partially effective in rescuing Pak2 KO
MLECs from apoptosis, suggesting that in endothelial cells, Pak2
uses multiple pathways to protect against apoptotic events.

Deletion of Pak2 in ECs induces cytoskeleton modiﬁcations
similar to those found in ECs deleted for certain upstream regu-
lators or downstream effectors of Pak kinases (24, 43, 44). Indeed,
similar to our observations on endothelial Pak2 KO, endothelial
Rac1 KO, and endothelial Erk1/2 KO embryos present with severe
growth retardation, Erk1 KO and Rac1 KO ECs have decreased
angiogenic potential, similar to our ﬁndings with Pak2 KO ECs.
However, both Erk 1 KO andRac1 KO ECs are associated with a
densely packed endothelium that is less permeable to proteins
(43, 44).

Vascular barrier integrity is a reversible and dynamic process
that is essential for tissue homeostasis, and defects in barrier main-
tenance and stabilization can result in increased inﬂammation,
edema, and hemorrhage. The roles of Paks in the control of vas-
cular permeability are complex and contingent on the choice of
model system, context, and permeability-inducing stimulus (5, 6,
9, 14, 24).

For example, using a peptide inhibitor, Stockton et al. showed
that blocking group I Pak activation prevented an increase in per-
meability across the cell monolayer in response to a wide variety of
permeability factors (4). In these studies, a Pak leads to an increase
in pMLC in ECs, resulting in contracted ECs that lose contact with
the neighboring cells resulting in a more permeable endothelium
(4, 7, 45). The Pak2 KD and KO phenotypes we observed, such as
an increase in central pMLC-decorated ﬁlaments, radial stress ﬁ-
bers, and permeability, seem inconsistent with these potential
mechanisms. In further support of a potential propermeability
role of Pak2, it has been shown that a Pak inhibitory peptide
caused a decrease in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothe-
lial permeability in a mouse model of lung inﬂammation (46).
These results suggest that group I Paks play a positive role in pro-
moting permeability. One potential mechanism underlying this
model is the phosphorylation of VE-cadherin by Pak2 at S665, an
event that promotes the internalization of this cadherin, destabi-
lization of cell junctions, and an increase in in vitro monolayer
permeability (19).

In contrast to these reports, several studies implicate Pak sig-
naling as a positive regulator of endothelial barrier integrity and
recovery in the presence of permeability-increasing stimuli, such
as LPS, thrombin, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣) (47).
Here, Pak activation is proposed to occur downstream of Rap1
signaling, a pathway that protects endothelial junctions by stabi-
lizing junctions and promoting cytoskeletal rearrangements via
the cAMP-regulated RapGEF Epac1 (47). We show that Pak2 KD
reduced circumferential actin band formation and prevented
complete dissolution of stress ﬁbers in the presence of elevated
cAMP. In line with Pak’s role in promoting endothelial stabiliza-
tion, it has also been shown that activation of Pak in a hypoxia-
induced neonatal pulmonary hypertension mouse model leads to
reduction in vascular permeability (13). Further, it has been
shown that loss of pak2a in a zebraﬁsh model is associated with

cerebral hemorrhage and increased blood vessel permeability
without signiﬁcantly altering vascular patterning (5, 48). These
studies suggest a role for group I Paks, and perhaps Pak2 in par-
ticular, in inhibiting vascular permeability. Our studies support
this position, as we show that, while loss of Pak1 has little effect on
either endothelial permeability in vitro or vascular permeability in
vivo, reduction or deletion of Pak2 profoundly increases vascular
permeability both in vitro and in vivo in the lungs and skin of
ePak2 KO mice. We did not observe an increase in permeability in
spleen and liver. This organ-speciﬁc increase could be due to bet-
ter Pak2 recombination in lung and skin ECs, a more prominent
role of Pak2 in ECs from these tissues, or an increase in the sus-
ceptibility of these vessels to leak. These organs also presented
with a higher Evans blue extravasation in wild-type mice as
well, possibly due to the open circulation in hepatic and spleen
sinusoidal vessels. Our genetic data thus fall squarely into the
camp that posits that Pak2 inhibits EC permeability. As our
approach is the ﬁrst to test the absolute absence of Pak2 in ECs,
it is possible that the contradictory permeability results from
the literature are due to a necessity of a certain minimum Pak2
threshold level. Possibly, when minimal Pak2 is present in ECs,
it can still rescue from apoptosis, maintain the EC barrier func-
tion, and initiate an overactivation of Rac signaling that might
lead to increased contractility.

To further explain the increased permeability of Pak2 KO en-
dothelium, we compared various mouse phenotypes that also pre-
sented with an increased vascular permeability to the endothelial
Pak2 KO mouse phenotype. Endothelial Bmk1/Erk5 KO embryos
and adult Bmk1/Erk5 KO mice have phenotypes that are very sim-
ilar to those of endothelial Pak2 KO embryos and mice. Endothe-
lial deletion of Pak2 leads to embryo lethality at E9.5, while endo-
thelial deletion of Erk5 is lethal at E10.5. Genetic deletion of Pak2
has been shown to lead to reduced HSPC (hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cell) bone marrow homing and engraftment (36),
hinting toward complex roles of Pak2 in various blood cell lin-
eages. It is thus possible that the earlier embryo lethality seen in
ePak2 KO embryos is due to a more comprehensive signaling, one
that partially superimposes Bmk1/Erk5 networks (Fig. 7). Similar
to endothelial Bmk1/Erk5 KO embryos, endothelial Pak2 KO em-
bryos show dilated blood vessels in the embryo body and yolk sac.
Furthermore, similar to Erk5 KO blood vessels, Pak2 KO blood
vessels are more permeable and show impaired angiogenesis. Re-
ports linking Erk5 to angiogenesis are abundant; however, the role
Erk5 plays in angiogenic processes seems to vary greatly between
different cell and animal model contexts, as well as with various
angiogenic stimuli (31, 49, 50). We have found that in a Pak2 KO
context, ECs can be rescued from apoptosis by overexpression of
Mek5. Similarly, Pi et al. show that Mek5 can rescue EC apoptosis
through a Bad phosphorylation event (51).

Molecular analysis of Pak2 KO ECs showed decreased levels of
P-Erk5 upon induction with EGF. Interestingly, P-Erk1/2 levels
were not affected in Pak1 KO or Pak2 KO primary ECs, suggesting
a selective, and hitherto undetected, link between Pak2 and the
Bmk1/Erk5 MAPK pathway. It has been previously shown that
Erk5 downregulation in hepatic stellate cells results in decreased
Pak phosphorylation (52). In contrast, Komaravolu et al. recently
reported that activation of the Bmk1/Erk5 pathway in ECs leads to
decreased Pak1 expression both at the mRNA and protein levels

Pak2 Regulates Vascular Development and Function

(53). Our data support a role for Pak2 upstream of Erk5 and sug-
gest that this pathway is critical for migration, angiogenesis, and
protection from apoptosis. In this setting, the reported effects of
Erk5 on Pak activity and/or expression may represent a form of
feedback regulation, as is common in signaling pathways. Similar
to Erk5/Bmk1 KO mice, Pak2 KO mice die upon induction of gene
deletion (Fig. 5D). The adult lethality induced by Pak2 deletion
and the severe phenotypes induced by the endothelial Pak2 dele-
tion raise important warning signs for the use of Pak inhibitors as
chemotherapeutic drugs.

These data point to Pak2 as the main group I Pak isoform
responsible for maintenance of normal endothelial biology, both
during embryonic development and during adulthood.
