Abstract Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth in neu-
roﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) can be responsible for brain-
stem compression and hearing loss. Surgical
removal
remains the standard therapy despite potential morbidity.
Previous studies suggested that the inhibition of the VEGF-
pathway with bevacizumab could result in hearing im-
provement, reduction of the tumor volume or both in
adults. We retrospectively describe the French experience
of bevacizumab treatment delivered for progressive VS in
pediatric NF2 patients. Patients received Bevacizumab 5 or
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks according to the physician’s
choice. Follow-up included clinical assessment, au-
diometry and volumetric MRI every 3–6 months. Seven
patients harboring 11 VS were included. The median age at

inclusion was 15 years (11.4–18.8), and the median treat-
ment duration was 11.3 months (3.2–55.6). At baseline, the
median tumor volume was 1.2 cm3 (0.52–13.5) and the
median word recognition score was 90 % (0–100). We
observed one major response, two minor responses and a
decrease in the rate of tumor growth for the 4 other pa-
tients. The median annual growth rate before treatment was
signiﬁcantly higher than after 1 year of treatment (138 vs.
36 %, n = 5, p = 0.043). We noted one hearing im-
provement over the course of 1 year under treatment
(hearing response rate was 14 %). Overall, the treatment
was well tolerated. Our study supports that bevacizumab is
an attractive therapeutic option for pediatric NF2 patients
with growing VS. Thorough multidisciplinary evaluation is
necessary to identify the best candidates prior to treatment.
It is likely that a better functional outcome would be ex-
pected if targeted therapies were discussed early in the
management of the disease.

Introduction

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited
genetic condition caused by heterozygous mutations in the
NF2 tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 22q12,
with a birth incidence of 1 in 25,000 [1].

The hallmark of NF2 is bilateral vestibular schwanno-
mas (also known as acoustic neuromas) and a higher risk of
multiple nervous system tumors, including schwannomas,
meningiomas and ependymomas.

The mortality risk increases with young age at diagnosis
and the functional prognosis remains poor [2]. Untreated

123

tumor growth can be responsible for inevitable spontaneous
hearing loss, facial nerve paralysis and progressive brain-
stem compression.

Currently, despite frequent functional impairment, sur-
gical removal remains the standard therapy for unilateral
vestibular schwannoma (VS). Indeed, patients often expe-
rience iatrogenic hearing loss in the treated ear requiring
rehabilitation through the use of a cochlear implant or an
auditory brainstem implant. As an alternative or in addition
to tumor removal, stereotactic irradiation can be used to
delay tumor progression, but it is thought to increase the
risk for secondary malignancies in these patients [3].
Moreover, radiation therapy frequently accelerates loss of
hearing.

Effective and safe treatments, able to control tumor
growth without impairing hearing potential, are urgently
needed for NF2 patients.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical
mediator of tumor angiogenesis and vessel permeability. A
previous
study showed that VEGF is produced by
schwannoma tumor cells and suggested that VEGF may
participate in tumor growth [4–6]. Other studies suggested
that
inhibition of VEGF with the VEGF- neutralizing
monoclonal antibody bevacizumab could result in hearing
improvement, reduction in tumor volume or both [4, 7, 8].
Moreover, the imaging ﬁndings indicated that the mean
apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) at baseline could be a
potential predictive marker for a volumetric response to
anti-VEGF therapy [4, 8].

In the present study, we investigated the hearing func-
tion and VS size in a pediatric population with NF2 treated
with bevacizumab.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to
examine the effectiveness of bevacizumab in a speciﬁc
pediatric population of NF2.

Materials and methods

Patients and treatment

For this retrospective study, all French pediatric oncology
departments have been contacted. We included all con-
secutive patients fulﬁlling the Manchester criteria for the
clinical diagnosis of NF2, presenting with evidence of
progressive VS (i.e. growing VS), less than 20 years of
age at baseline and who received at least 3 months of
bevacizumab treatment from October 14, 2009 to June 27,
2013. All children treated by avastin for progressive
schwannoma were enrolled, regardless of the progress.
Tumor growth was evaluated on the last 3, 6 or 12 months
(depending on the center) and calculated as a percentage
of
linear

linear growth. The minimal percentages of

123

J Neurooncol

growth were ?15 % et 3 months, ?38 % at 6 months and
?100 % at 12 months.

Each patient received intravenous bevacizumab 5 mg/kg
(4 patients) or 10 mg/kg (three patients) every 2 weeks,
according to the choice of each physician, without any dose
modiﬁcations. The seven NF2 patients for whom no other
treatment options were available opted for treatment with
bevacizumab after extensive consultation, discussions with
patients and their families, and informed consent.

Data from patients were retrospectively collected. In this
context, and according to our institutional guidelines, no
institutional review board was mandatory.

Clinical, radiological and audiological evaluations

Before starting treatment, baseline Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) and audiology (pure tone average (PTA)
for each patient, speech recognition threshold (SRT) for six
patients and speech discrimination score (SDS) for four
patients) were performed.

Radiological tumor responses were determined by using
serial MRI conducted every 3–4 months. We collected
MRI exams throughout France from different pediatric
oncology departments.

Tracking of VS growth was based on three-dimensional
volumetrics because linear diameter measures underesti-
mate the volumetric growth of VS [9]. Volumetric mea-
surements were blinded and assessed using Osirix software
(OsiriX v.5.8.1, Pixmeo Co., Switzerland) on contrast-en-
hanced T1-weighted axial images, with the delineation of
the tumor borders performed by a radiologist. For tumors
with indistinct limits, non-enhanced T1-weighted, three-
dimensional high-resolution T2-weigthed (3D HR T2) and
multiplanar reconstruction contrast enhanced T1-weighted
images were reviewed. Volumetric measurements were
only validated on a maximum 2.5-mm thickness series with
no interslice gap.

The median tumor growth rate was calculated when
then 3, 5 and

available 3 months prior to treatment,
12 months after starting bevacizumab.

We also evaluated the mean ADC before treatment be-
cause of the correlation with tumor shrinkage [4, 8]. ADC
was calculated when available with the same region of
interest. B values were not the same between the different
scanners. ADC correlation with tumor shrinkage was only
validated when realized on the same scanner with the same
B value (i.e., for four patients).

A tumor radiologic response was deﬁned as minor when
the tumor volume decreased between 5 and 19 %, and
major when the decrease was greater than 20 %, as ac-
cepted criteria for NF2 VS [10].

Hearing response was determined by an audiology test
every 3–6 months. Compliance with the American

J Neurooncol

Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery
[AAO-HNS] grading system was not effective in all centers
because the usual audiology testing and scoring differs in
France compared to North America [11] and was only
applicable in the reporting center (Lille).

The reporting center used a combination based on PTA,
SDS and SRT. One center used a combination based on
PTA and SDS. The third one used only PTA.

Toxicity assessment

Patient evaluation,
including a physical examination,
complete blood count, chemistry panel, and urinalysis, was
performed at baseline, then every 2–4 weeks during treat-
ment. Echocardiography and coagulation tests were per-
formed before and periodically during treatment. Toxicity
data were scored according to the National Cancer Insti-
tute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
version 4.0.

Statistical analysis

Statistical evaluations were performed using the statistical
program IBM IPSS statistics 22. We used Spearman co-
efﬁcient correlation for analyses of mean ADC and tumor
shrinkage. Tumor growth rates before and during beva-
cizumab treatment were compared for tumor volume using
a Wilcoxon paired test. A p value of less than 0.05 was
considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

Results

Patient cohort

Seven patients from three pediatric oncology departments
were included (three boys and four girls) harboring 11 VS.
Two of them had a family history of NF2 (28.6 %), and the
median age of symptoms onset was 7 years (range,
3.5–14 years).

None of the patients had previously been treated by
medical treatment. Three of them had undergone surgical
resection of a controlateral VS before starting bevacizumab
(43 %) but presented no VS recurrence after surgery.

At

inclusion,

the median age was 15 years (range,
11.4–18.8 years). At baseline, the median PTA was 16
(range, 8–58) and the median tumor volume was 1.2 cm3
(range, 0.5–13.5 cm3).

The median treatment duration was 11.3 months (range,

3.2–55.6 months).

Two patients were still being treated with bevacizumab
at the end of the study period. (Table 1). Two patients

discontinued treatment for severe adverse events and four
due to the lack of volumetric response.

Tumor growth rate

The median annual growth rate in tumor volume before
treatment was 138 % (range, 100–254 %).

The evolution of the tumor growth rate was available for
8 VS but response rate was performed on 7 VS because one
patient had only one MRI before starting bevacizumab.
Comparisons between tumor growth before and during
bevacizumab were achievable at 3 months for 4 VS, at
6 months for 3 VS and at 1 year for 5 VS. All of the 8 VS
had a lower tumor growth rate.

The largest decrease in growth rate was achieved after

1 year of bevacizumab (Figure 1).

The median annual growth rate before treatment was
signiﬁcantly higher than after 1 year of treatment (138 %
(range, 100–254) vs 36 % (range, -18–81), p = 0.043).

The median tumor growth rate during the 3 months prior
to initiation of Bevacizumab was higher than the median
tumor growth rate observed after 3 months of treatment
(24 % (13–33 %) vs -2 % (-12–23 %), p = 0.068), as
observed at 6 months
(40 % (38–40 %) vs -3 %
(-3–12 %), p = 0.11). However, these modiﬁcations in
tumor growth rate were not really signiﬁcant.

Volumetric response

Volumetric response was assessable for seven patients
harboring 11 VS. Objective tumor shrinkage was observed
in three patients (3/7), with one major and two minor
responses.

The maximal tumor reduction was 22 % at 9 months of
treatment for patient no 3 with stabilization until the last
follow up (13 months).

Patient no1 presented a 17 % tumor reduction in size
after 3 months of treatment with bevacizumab but treat-
ment was stopped after occurrence of a severe adverse
event (osteomyelitis). Patient no 6 had a tumor shrinkage
of 6 % at 6 months (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, we observed a
slight regression of facial schwannoma during the treat-
ment with bevacizumab for patient 1.

Mean apparent diffusion coefﬁcient and tumor
shrinkage

Baseline ADC values were available for 4 VS. We ob-
served no signiﬁcant correlation, but a trend towards a
relationship, between the mean ADC value for the tumor at
baseline and tumor shrinkage at 3 months (Spearman’s
correlation, -0.80; r2 = 0.72; p = 0.20). However, it is
likely that this correlation is underpowered.

Hearing response

Adverse events

Four of seven patients were assessable for hearing response
according to AAO-HNS guidelines (due to ceiling effect
i.e. the inability to show a hearing improvement in indi-
viduals with excellent hearing at baseline).

We noted one hearing beneﬁt with continuous im-
provement over the course of 1 year in a patient with
rapidly growing VS (no 4). One of four eligible patients for
hearing response by SDS responded. SDS increased from
60 % at baseline on the left ear to 90 % at 3 months and
100 % at 6 months. On the right ear SDS increased from
90 to 100 % at 3 months. The result was durable at the end
of the follow-up.

The three others patients remained stable for SDS,
Speech Reception Threshold, PTA and presented no changes
relative to the AAO-HNS hearing class classiﬁcations.

Overall, the treatment was relatively well tolerated. A total
of 7 adverse events in ﬁve children were reported.

Two patients discontinued treatment for severe adverse
events: grade 3 hypertension and a grade 3 infectious event
(osteitis). Osteomyelitis was noted in a bedsore context.
The patient already had a prior lesion before bevacizumab.
The child was suffering from intraspinal Ependymoma
responsible for neuropathic pain and had a small wound at
the pressure point on the right foot. The wound was dug
under bevacizumab to become an ulcer and then os-
teomyelitis. Osteomyelitis was probably not related to
treatment, but exacerbated by bevacizumab through wound
healing impairment.

One patient needed dose reduction because of grade 2
epistaxis and grade 1 non-infectious wound complication.

Discussion

Bilateral VS are distinctive features of NF2. Even if VS are
slow-growing benign tumors, they develop on nerves and
can be responsible for hearing loss, tinnitus, imbalance,
facial paralysis, brainstem compression, and death despite
aggressive management. Unfortunately, the tumor growth
is unpredictable. Regular clinical and MRI follow-ups are
recommended to track the tumor growth rate. In a large
cohort of patients with NF2 VS, Slattery et al. reported
continuous tumor growth both short and long-term sug-
gesting that slowing the growth rate over extended periods
of time should presumably delay morbidity. The changes in
size were not related to age at diagnosis, family history of
NF2, initial size of the VS and were not related to the
potential change in the other schwannoma [12].

Complete surgical resection is curative, but the timing
for tumor removal is controversial, with a complex risk–
beneﬁt ratio, between risks of surgery and tumor’s natural
history.

Recent consensus proposed surgical resection of the
largest tumors ([3 cm in diameter) permitting facial nerve
preservation and brainstem protection [13]. There is no
consensus for the management of VS less than 3 cm in
diameter [13]. Unresectable tumors and hearing impair-
ment following surgery justify the introduction of new
effective and safe therapies.

VEGF is a protein growth factor involved in tumor an-
giogenesis. Previous reports have shown that VEGF was
expressed in 100 % of VS and VEGFR-2 in 32 % of VS
vessels [4]. VEGFR-1 is a decoy receptor that does not
signal or promote angiogenesis. Expression levels of
VEGF and VEGFR-1 in VS correlate with the tumor
growth rate [6]. These preclinical ﬁndings resulted in
clinical studies of the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody
bevacizumab in adults with VS [4, 7, 8], but data con-
cerning children are rare.

In our pediatric study we found a lower hearing im-
provement rate compared with previously published study
in adults (14 vs 57 %) [4]. Objective tumor shrinkage was
observed for three patients (3/7), with only one major re-
sponse (22 % volume reduction after 9 months) and two
minor responses. This response rate seemed to be lower
than in adults, and irrespective for baseline tumor volume.
In one study, Plotkin et al. showed that the median best
response to treatment was a volumetric reduction of 26 %
and that 6 of the 10 patients had an imaging response [4].

123

J Neurooncol

In another study, treatment with bevacizumab resulted in a
43 and 41 % volume loss in two patients [7]. In a retro-
spective review including 31 patients, Plotkin et al. re-
ported a radiographic response in 55 % of target VS [8].
However, the median annual growth rate before treatment
was two-fold higher in our NF2 pediatric population in
contrast
to two previously published VS NF2 adult
population series (138 %/year vs 62 % [4] and 64 % [8],
respectively). These ﬁndings could suggest more aggres-
sive tumor behavior in pediatric patients, possibly related
to a different biological pattern.

As previously described [4, 8], we observed a relation-
ship between the mean ADC value at baseline and the
percent decrease in volume at 3 months. The lack of sig-
niﬁcance of the correlation could be explained by the va-
riety of MRI scanners (1.5T, 3T) and diffusion protocols
(B800, 1000, multi B…) used in the different centers.

In our study, bevacizumab was well tolerated and the
risk–beneﬁt balance was favorable. The rare adverse events
were satisfactorily manageable and the two severe adverse
events (hypertension and delayed recovery of osteitis) were
totally reversible with complete recovery. As already de-
scribed [14], the most commonly associated events seem to
be hypertension and proteinuria. In a previous cohort of 33
NF2 patients treated with bevacizumab, 58 % of subjects
developed hypertension [15]. However, the median delay
in the development of hypertension was 12.8 months,
which exceed our median treatment duration and the pa-
tients were signiﬁcantly older. Likewise, proteinuria was
less frequent than described in adults in which freedom
from proteinuria at 1 year was only 68 % [15]. The best
responses were in patients receiving a lower dose of be-
vacizumab suggesting that this lower dose might be rec-
ommended in case of long term treatment.

In addition to the adverse effects, bevacizumab also has
other limitations. First, as for three of our patients (No 1, 3
and 5), it seems that treatment effect was temporary and
that the beneﬁts could be reversed at discontinuation. Se-
cond, the common wound healing impairment may inter-
fere with the necessary surgery for one of the multiple NF2
tumors and could lead to the temporary discontinuation of
bevacizumab.

Because of a the crucial need for effective therapies, a

few studies investigated other targeted agents [13].

Lapatinib and erlotinib target

the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK). In 2010, a pilot study with erlotinib on 11 patients
with VS, showed three minor responses [16]. In 2012, la-
patinib lead to a major response in 1 out of 17 patients and
minor responses for 9 out of 17 patients [17]. In vitro, a
previous study of 2 drugs targeting platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR) demonstrated that imatinib and
nilotinib could be attractive candidates for VS treatment

from bench to bedside.

[18]. Moreover, two preclinical reports showed that histone
desacetylase inhibitor (HDAC) AR42 inhibits schwannoma
growth at doses leading to AKT pathway inhibition [19,
20].

Furthermore, in vitro, inhibition of the mammalian tar-
get of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) delays growth of
NF schwannoma [21], but
in a recent phase II study,
mTORC1 signaling pathway inhibition by everolimus was
ineffective in ten NF2 patients [22].

Combination therapies could be a major management
tool. The HDAC inhibitor valproic acid was used in com-
bination with soraﬁnib and with erlotinib but studies were
stopped early because of adverse events [23]. An mTOR
inhibitor in combination with bevacizumab induced a 33 %
volumetric reduction in one patient [23].

NF2 patients should be managed in reference centers,
with multidisciplinary evaluation and management
to
identify the best candidates prior to treatment because
treatment should not interfere with other tumor manage-
ment. Bevacizumab could be an attractive option therapy in
the management of the disease to delay surgery but, an
early initiation of therapy could involve toxicities limiting
long-term treatment. A systematic gene proﬁling analysis
of tumor expression could discriminate subgroups of pa-
tients, possibly demonstrating a different proﬁle in pedi-
atric patients compared to adult VS and provide some
targets for personalized speciﬁc therapies.
