MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are frequently deregulated in human tumors,
and play important roles in tumor development and progression.
The pathological roles of miRNAs in neuroﬁbromatosis type 1
(NF1) tumorigenesis are largely unknown. We demonstrated that
miR-10b was up-regulated in primary Schwann cells isolated from
NF1 neuroﬁbromas and in cell lines and tumor tissues from malig-
nant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Intriguingly, a sig-
niﬁcantly high level of miR-10b correlated with low neuroﬁbromin
expression was found in a neuroectodermal cell line: Ewing’s sar-
coma SK-ES-1 cells. Antisense inhibiting miR-10b in NF1 MPNST
cells reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Further-
more, we showed that NF1 mRNA was the target for miR-10b.
Overexpression of miR-10b in 293T cells suppressed neuroﬁbromin
expression and activated RAS signaling. Antisense inhibition of
miR-10b restored neuroﬁbromin expression in SK-ES-1 cells, and
decreased RAS signaling independent of neuroﬁbromin in NF1
MPNST cells. These results suggest that miR-10b may play an
important role in NF1 tumorigenesis through targeting neuroﬁbro-
min and RAS signaling. (Cancer Sci 2010; 101: 1997–2004)

N euroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1; OMIM #162200) is the

most common inherited tumor predisposition syndrome,
which occurs one in every 3000–3500 human births world-
wide.(1,2) Multiple neuroﬁbromas are the hallmark of NF1. One
subtype of neuroﬁbroma, the plexiform neuroﬁbroma, occurs in
about 30% of NF1 individuals. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1)
individuals with plexiform neuroﬁbromas have a >10% lifetime
risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNSTs),(3) the most common malignant tumor associated
with NF1. Although complete surgical resection is often not pos-
sible, surgery remains the only treatment option for plexiform
neuroﬁbromas and MPNSTs. The prognosis for patients with
MPNSTs is poor, with an overall 5-year survival rate of just
34%.(4) Despite the urgent need, targeted therapies for MPNSTs
to improve survival are not obvious.

It is generally accepted that Schwann cells are the primary
transformed cells in neuroﬁbromas, and that loss of heterozygos-
ity (LOH) in NF1 locus in Schwann cells initiates tumorigenesis
and development of neuroﬁbromas. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1
(NF1) protein, neuroﬁbromin, contains a highly conserved
GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) that
converts active RAS-GTP into inactive RAS-GDP in the RAS
signaling pathway.(5) Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in Schwann
cells reduces or diminishes the expression of neuroﬁbromin, and
thus activates the RAS signaling pathway and contributes to
tumor development.(6–8)

In addition to LOH, mRNA processes, such as unequal
expression of NF1 alleles, NF1 mRNA editing, and NF1 mRNA
stability or transport, can affect neuroﬁbromin expression and
regulate NF1 tumorigenesis.(9–14) Unequal allelic expression of
the NF1 gene has been detected in ﬁbroblasts, lymphoblasts,
keratinocytes, and melanocytes in NF1 patients,(12,13,15) which
signiﬁcantly reduces neuroﬁbromin expression. Neuroﬁbromato-
sis type 1 (NF1) mRNA editing creates an in-frame translation
stop codon within the ﬁrst half of the GRD without activity
toward the RAS proteins, resulting in a functionally equivalent
biallelic inactivation.(12,13,16) The 3¢ untranslated region (UTR)
of NF1 mRNA is highly conserved among different species.(17)
This UTR region binds to tumor antigen HuR, and contains four
potential protein-binding domains, which may introduce addi-
tional mechanisms to control mRNA stability,
intracellular
localization, and the efﬁciency of translation.(18)

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs
of about 19–25 nucleotides that function as negative post-tran-
scriptional gene regulators.(19) miRNAs hybridize to 3¢ UTR of
target mRNAs, and can repress translation or mediate mRNA
cleavage. Studies show that miRNAs critically regulate tumori-
genesis and progression.(20,21) Different tumor types and tumors
at various stages of differentiation exhibit unique miRNA pro-
ﬁles.(22,23) We hypothesize that speciﬁc miRNAs may serve as
an alternative for LOH of the NF1 gene and regulate NF1
tumorigenesis. To test this hypothesis, we determined miRNA
proﬁles in NF1 tumor tissues and cell lines. Our data reveal that
miR-10b targets neuroﬁbromin and RAS signaling, and may
play an important role in NF1 tumorigenesis.

Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA), were main-
tained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Neuro-
ﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) mutation status for these three cell
lines has been reported by other groups previously.(26,27) SBC5
and SBC3, human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines,(28)
were purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Biore-
sources Cell Bank (Osaka, Japan). Other tumor cell lines were
purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). All these cell lines
were maintained in the medium recommended by the vendors.

Analysis of miRNA expression by microarray and qRT-
PCR. RNA was extracted from cells or tissues using the RNeasy
miRNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). miRNA microarrays
were performed by LC Sciences (Houston, TX, USA). Reverse
transcriptase (RT) and quantitative real-time PCR were per-
formed in a two-step reaction using Taqman microRNA assays
according to protocol provided by the manufacturer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). U6 was used as internal
)DDCT method, described by Livak and Schmitt-
control. The 2
gen,(29) was used to analyze data.

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) 3¢ UTR reporter assay. The 3¢
UTR of the NF1 gene was ampliﬁed into pcDNA3 vector from
human genomic DNA and its sequence was conﬁrmed by DNA
sequencing. Point mutations within the target sequence for
miR-10b in NF1 3¢UTR (NF1 3¢ UTRm) were generated with
the QuickChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strata-
gene, La Jolla, TX, USA). The plasmids containing NF1 3¢
UTRm were sequenced to conﬁrm replacement of the targeted
residues. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) 3¢ UTR or NF1 3
UTRm was sub-cloned into the 3¢UTR of the pMIR-REPORT
miRNA reporter vector (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The pMIR
reporter vector or pMIR reporter vector with NF1 3¢UTR(m)
was stably transfected into 293T cells. Stably transfected cells
were then transiently co-transfected with a miR-10b expression
vector
plasmid
#16070)(30) or an empty vector (MDH1-PGK-GFP) together
with the pMIR-REPORT b-galactosidase reporter control vector
(Ambion). Cells were collected 30 h after transfection, and the
ratio of b-galactosidase to ﬁreﬂy luciferase was measured with
the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

miR-10b over-expression in 293T cells. The MDH1-PGK-
GFP ⁄ miR-10b vector or
the MDH1-PGK-GFP vector was
transfected into 293T cells. At 48 h after transfection, cells were
serum-starved for 24 h, protein and RNA were processed for
western blotting and qRT-PCR analyses.

Targeted inhibition or enhancement of endogenous miRNAs in
lines. ST88-14 or SK-ES-1 or STS26T cell lines
tumor cell
were grown in cell culture plates overnight. Various miRNA
inhibitors (miR-10b, miR-155, miR-335), precursors (let-7a,
miR-10b), or controls (all from Ambion) were transfected into
cells using Lipofectin 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were
analyzed by various assays described below.

Western blotting. Cells grown to 70–80% conﬂuence in six-
or 12-well plates were serum-starved for 24 h and lysed in RIPA
buffer. The blotting membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C
with different primary antibodies: anti-p44 ⁄ 42 MAP kinase
(1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA),
anti-phospho-p44 ⁄ 42 MAPK (Thr202 ⁄ Tyr204) (1:1000; Cell
Signaling), anti-neuroﬁbromin (sc–67, 1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-TWIST1 (1:1000;
Cell Signaling), and anti-b-actin (1:1000; Sigma). The blots
were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody: anti-goat or -mouse
IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). Signals were visualized
using ECL plus chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham,
Piscataway, NJ, USA).

MTT assay. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of
1000 cells ⁄ well overnight. Various miRNA inhibitors or precur-

sors or controls were transfected into cells with Lipofectin 2000
(Invitrogen). After serum starvation for 24 h, medium was
replaced with 100-lL fresh medium containing 0.5 mg ⁄ mL
MTT at the indicated time points. After 4-h incubation, medium
was removed and purple blue sediment was dissolved in 150 lL
DMSO. The relative optical density (OD) for each well was
determined using a Wellscan MK3 ELIASA kit (Labsystems,
Dragon, Finland).

Colony formation. ST88-14 cells transfected with miR-10b
inhibitors or negative controls were cultured in six-well plates
for 14 days. Cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 min, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min, washed
with distilled water, and dried. Colonies were counted under
bright-ﬁeld microscopy.

Cell migration and invasion. Transfected cells were serum-
starved for 24 h and then pulsed with 5 lM of cell tracker green
(Invitrogen) for 30 min. Labeled cells were trypsinized and
replated in 0.2% FBS-containing medium without growth
factors at a density of 25 000 cells per well in a transwell insert
(3-lm pore size; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for the
migration assay or 50 000 cells per well in matrigel-coated,
growth-factor-reduced, invasion chambers (8-lm pore size; BD
Biosciences) for invasion assay. After 6-h incubation for migra-
tion assay or 22-h incubation for invasion assay, cells were ﬁxed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. Cells on the apical side of
each insert were scraped off, and those that had migrated to the
basal side of the membrane were visualized under a Zeiss Axi-
overt 200 M microscope. Cell numbers were quantiﬁed in an
automated mode using Metamorph analysis software (Downing-
town, PA, USA).

Statistical analyses. Analyses were performed with JMP 8.0
software (SAS, Cary, NC, USA). ANOVA was used to compare
multiple groups, followed by pairwise comparisons if signiﬁcant
differences were detected; Dunnett’s test was used for compari-
son with a control group (Figs 1,4c,d,6a), and the Tukey–Kra-
mer test was used for comparison of all groups (Figs 2,3).
Unpaired t-tests were used to compare two groups (Figs 4a,5d).
To determine the effects of both genetic manipulation (lucifer-
ase and luciferase ⁄ NF1 3¢UTR) and treatments (control or miR-
10b), a two-way ANOVA and pairwise comparisons were used
(Fig. 5b). Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant at
P < 0.05 on a two-tailed test. Data are expressed as mean ±
SEM.

Results

Differential and selective miRNA expression proﬁles in NF1
lines. We ﬁrst compared miRNA
versus non-NF1 MPNST cell
proﬁles in ST88-14 cells and STS26T cells. ST88-14 is a cell
line derived from human NF1 MPNSTs that does not express
detectable neuroﬁbromin,(27,31) but high level of TWIST1
(Fig. 1f). STS26T is a cell line derived from non-NF1 MPNSTs
that does not have NF1 mutations, and expresses neuroﬁbromin
(Fig. 1f and refs 27,31). Of 833 miRNAs analyzed, 70 miRNAs
were identiﬁed to be up-regulated and 40 were down-regulated
in ST8814 cells compared with STS26T cells. Among these dif-
ferentially expressed miRNAs, more than 20 were expressed at
very high levels (density over 500) in either ST88-14 or STS26T
cells (Table 1). Of interest, the oncogenic miRNAs, miR-10b,
miR-155, and miR-335,(30,32–34) exhibited selective higher
expression in ST88-14. Expression of let-7 family members, let-
7a, 7b, c, d, e, and f, known to target RAS,(35) was signiﬁcantly
lower in ST88-14 than in STS26T cells.

The microarray data was further conﬁrmed in NF1 MPNST
cells (ST88-14 and T265p21) versus non-NF1 MPNST cells
(STS26T) by qRT-PCR. T265p21 is a cell line derived from
human NF1 MPNSTs that expresses a very low level of neuroﬁ-
bromin, but a high level of TWIST1 (Fig. 1f). Interestingly, the

a signiﬁcant amount neuroﬁbromin, but a lower

but a higher level of TWIST1.

T265p21 cell line displayed a miRNA proﬁle similar to the
neuroﬁbromin-deﬁcient NF1 MPNST cell
line ST88-14. In
ST88-14 and T265p21 cells, miR-10b expression was 20–30-
fold higher, miR-155 expression was over 4000-fold higher,
miR-335 expression was 30–70-fold higher, let-7a expression
was approximately 50% lower, and let-7b expression was
approximately 90% lower, compared to that in ST262T cells
(Fig. 1a–e). Subsequent analyses were focused on these ﬁve
miRNAs (miR-10b, miR-155, miR-335,
let-7a, and let-7b),

wherein their expression levels exhibited marked differences
between NF1 and non-NF1 MPNST cells.

miRNA proﬁles in human NF1 tumor tissues. To further inves-

and non-NF1 MPNSTs (n = 4, two males, two females; average
age: 49 years), as well as benign NF1 neuroﬁbroma tissues
(n = 13, nine males, four females; average age: 37 years). Com-

group (control, n = 13), a non-NF1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) group (n = 4), and an NF1 MPNST group (n = 8) according
to clinical and pathological diagnosis. miRNA expression was studied by qRT-PCR. Compared to the neuroﬁbroma control group, the expression
level of miR-10b was signiﬁcantly higher, while expression levels of let-7a and let-7b were signiﬁcantly lower in NF1 MPNST tissues. Compared
to non-NF1 MPNST, the expression level of miR-10b was signiﬁcantly higher in NF1 MPNST. There were no differences in expression levels of
miR-155 and miR-335 among the three groups. (a) Compared to NF1 neuroﬁbromas, P < 0.05; (b) compared to non-NF1MPNST, P < 0.05.

normal human adult sciatic nerves, and NF1 dermal and plexiform neuroﬁbromas. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines ST88-14 and T265p21 were also used for comparison. miRNA expression was studied by qRT-PCR. miR-10b
expression level was signiﬁcantly higher in NF1 dermal Schwann cells than in normal Schwann cells. Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) plexiform
Schwann cells also showed higher miR-10b expression, but the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant (P = 0.07). The highest expression level
of miR-10b was observed in NF1 MPNST cells. Expression levels of miR-155 and miR-335 were signiﬁcantly higher, and expression levels of let-7b
and let-7a were signiﬁcantly lower in NF1 MPNST cells. There were no signiﬁcant differences in the expression levels of miR-155, miR-335, and

pared to benign neuroﬁbromas, the expression level of miR-10b
was signiﬁcantly higher in NF1 but not in non-NF1 MPNSTs,
while those of let-7a and let-7b were signiﬁcantly lower in both
NF1 MPNSTs and non-NF1 MPNSTs (Fig. 2). The expression
level of miR-10b was signiﬁcantly higher in NF1 MPNSTs than
in non-NF1 MPNSTs (Fig. 2), although marginally elevated, but
insigniﬁcant expression levels of miR-155 and miR-335 were
observed in NF1 MPNSTs compared with in non-NF1 MPNSTs

(Fig. 3, P < 0.05). The miR-10b expression level appeared
higher in NF1 plexiform Schwann cells, but the difference was
not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 3, P = 0.07), likely due to small
sample size. Of
the highest miR-10b expression
occurred in NF1 MPNST cell
lines ST88-14 and T265p21
(Fig. 3, P < 0.05). Expression levels of miR-155 and miR-335
were signiﬁcantly higher in NF1 MPNST cells, but not in Schw-
ann cells isolated from NF1 dermal or NF1 plexiform neuroﬁ-
bromas (Fig. 3, P < 0.01). In contrast, expression of let-7a and
let-7b was signiﬁcantly lower in NF1 MPNST cells (Fig. 3,
P < 0.05).

Antisense inhibition of miR-10b expression reverses abnormal
cellular behaviors of NF1 MPNST cells. To further investigate the
functional signiﬁcance of a speciﬁc set of deregulated miRNAs
observed in NF1 MPNSTs cells, ST88-14 cells were transfected
with antisense inhibitors (miR-10b, miR-155, and miR-335),
mimic enhancers let-7a, or with negative controls. Inhibiting
miR-10b expression in ST8814 cells signiﬁcantly decreased cell
proliferation, migration, and invasion (Fig. 4a–d). Although
inhibiting miR-155 and miR-335 expression or enhancing let-7a
expression did not affect proliferation (data not shown) or
migration in ST88-14 cells (Fig. 4d), inhibiting miR-335 or
enhancing let-7a resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of cell inva-
sion (Fig. 4c). These results suggest that miR-10b plays an
important role in NF1 tumorigenic mechanisms, while miR-335
and let-7 may have a role in cell invasion.

miR-10b directly targets 3¢ UTR of NF1 mRNA and suppresses
neuroﬁbromin expression. Because loss-of-function in NF1 is
the central pathological mechanism in NF1 tumorigenesis, we
searched for potential miRNA that might target NF1 mRNA.
An analysis using TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/)
predicted that miRNA-10b, but not miR-155, miR-335, or let-
7a ⁄ 7b, would target
the 3¢ UTR of NF1 mRNA (Fig. 5a).
Interestingly, seed sequence of the targeted site in the NF1
mRNA for miR-10b was highly conserved among various
species (Fig. 5a), supporting a regulating role for miR-10b in
NF1 gene expression. To test this possibility, we cloned NF1
3¢UTR and placed it in the 3¢UTR of a luciferase reporter
expression cassette. Co-transfection in 293T cells with either
the miR-10b expression vector or a control vector showed
that overexpression of miR-10b signiﬁcantly reduced lucifer-
ase activity from the construct containing NF1 3¢UTR
(Fig. 5b; P < 0.05), while miR-10b failed to reduce luciferase

monitored transfection efﬁciency by visualizing GFP expression
and conﬁrming the miR-10b expression level by qRT-PCR (data
not shown). 293T cells are NF1+ ⁄ + and expressed neuroﬁbro-
min protein when transfected with the control vector. In con-
transfected with MDH1-PGK-GFP ⁄ miR-10b
trast,
expression vector expressed very low levels of neuroﬁbromin
(Fig. 5c). These results indicate that miR-10b selectively and
speciﬁcally targets NF1 mRNA to suppress neuroﬁbromin
expression. To determine the pathological roles of overexpress-
ing miR-10b in NF1 tumorigenesis, we transiently transfected
miR-10b enhancers into STS26T cells, which expressed low
miR-10b. Enhancing miR-10b signiﬁcantly increased invasion
(Fig. 5d), but not proliferation and migration in STS26T cells
(data not shown). This result indicates that overexprssion of
miR-10b directly regulates the cellular tumor characteristics.

Conversely, we examined if inhibiting miR-10b in tumor cells
expressing high miR-10b could restore neuroﬁbromin expres-
sion. Intriguingly, inhibiting miR-10b in ST88-14 and T265p21
did not restore neuroﬁbromin expression (data not shown). We
speculated that these NF1 MPNST cells may harbor some spe-
ciﬁc NF1 mutations, which affect mRNA translation and neuro-
ﬁbromin stability. We searched for tumor cells to conﬁrm that
low expression of neuroﬁbromin correlated with high miR-10b.
Compared to other cell lines, Ewing’s sarcoma cell line SK-ES-

1 expressed the highest miR-10b concurrently with undetectable
neuroﬁbromin (Fig. 6a,b). We hypothesized that miR-10b may
functionally target neuroﬁbromin in this cell line. Interestingly,
inhibiting miR-10b expression in SK-ES-1 cells substantially
increased neuroﬁbromin expression at 48 and 72 h after trans-
fection (Fig. 6c). Collectively, these results further support the
notion that miR-10b directly regulates neuroﬁbromin expres-
sion.

miR-10b modulates RAS signaling. Because most NF1-related
tumors display an abnormal RAS signaling pathway, we ques-
tioned whether miR-10b targets RAS signaling pathways. Using
web-based software, we identiﬁed a few proteins in the RAS sig-
naling pathway as candidate targets for miR-10b (Table 2). To
validate this ﬁnding, we overexpressed miR-10b in 293T cells.
293T cells transfected with the MDH1-PGK-GFP ⁄ miR-10b
expression vector exhibited a high level of phosphorylated ERK,
an index of RAS signaling (Fig. 7a). Because overexpressing
miR-10b in 293T cells knocked down neuroﬁbromin (Fig. 5c),
activated RAS may have directly resulted from loss-of-function
of neuroﬁbromin. Next we transfected miR-10b inhibitors or
negative controls into ST88-14 cells. Compared to controls,
ST88-14 cells transfected with the miR-10b inhibitors exhibited
less phosphorylated ERK after serum stimulation (Fig. 7b).
Collectively, these results indicated that changes in miR-10b

(a) The MDH1-PGK-
GFP ⁄ miR-10b (vector ⁄ miR-10b) or MDH1-PGK-GFP vector (vector) was
transfected into 293T cells. Transfected cells were stimulated with
serum free medium (control) or medium supplemented with 20% FBS
for 15 min, and phosphorylated ERK and total ERK were analyzed
by western blotting. Overexpressing miR-10b induced higher
phosphorylated ERK expression. (b) The miR-10b inhibitors or negative
controls were transfected into NF1 MPNST cells (ST88-14). Cells were
serum-starved for 24 h, and then incubated in serum-free medium
(control) or medium plus 20% FBS for 15 min. Phosphorylated ERK
and total ERK were detected by western blotting. Compared to
controls, inhibiting miR-10b expression reduced phosphorylated ERK
in response to serum stimulation.

likely modulate RAS signaling in NF1 MPNST cells. Because
neuroﬁbromin was undetectable in ST88-14 cells (Fig. 1f) and
inhibiting miR-10b did not restore neuroﬁbromin expression
(data not shown) in this NF1 MPNST cell line, miR-10b may
target RAS signaling pathways independent of neuroﬁbromin.

Discussion

miRNAs play critical roles in tumor development and progres-
sion.(20,21) Although oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles of
several miRNAs have been characterized in several different
types of tumors, possible roles of miRNAs in mediating NF1
tumorigenesis and tumor progression remain largely unexplored.
Subramanian et al.(36) recently reported a relative down-regula-
tion of miR-34a in most MPNSTs compared to neuroﬁbromas.
They concluded that p53 inactivation and subsequent loss of
expression of miR-34a may contribute to MPNST development.
In this study we demonstrate that expression level of miR-10b is
signiﬁcantly higher in NF1 MPNST cell lines, NF1 MPNST
tumor tissues, and primary Schwann cells from benign neuroﬁ-
bromas. These results, together with the ﬁnding that inhibiting
miR-10b in NF1 MPNST cells reduced cell proliferation, migra-
tion, and invasion, suggest an important role for miR-10b in the
genesis of NF1 neuroﬁbromas and their progression to aggres-
sive MPNSTs. We suggest that miR-10b may serve as a biomar-
ker to distinguish NF1 MPNSTs from non-NF1 MPNSTs, as the
expression level of miR-10b is signiﬁcantly higher in the NF1
MPNST cell
in non-NF1
MPNSTs.

line and tumor tissues than that

TWIST1, a metastasis-promoting transcription factor, has
been shown to enhance miR-10b expression via binding to the
most proximal E-box located upstream of the miR-10b hairpin
region.(30) TWIST1 gene expression is up-regulated in all

MPNST cell lines and tissues, compared to normal Schwann
cells.(26) In this study we found that TWIST1 expression was
higher in ST88-14 and T265p21 cells than in STS26T cells
(Fig. 1f). We speculate that up-regulation of TWIST1 likely
induces higher miR-10b expression in NF1 MPNSTs.

How miR-10b regulates NF1 tumorigenesis and progression
is likely complex. We showed that miR-10b targets NF1 mRNA
3¢UTR and represses neuroﬁbromin expression in 293T cells
(Fig. 5); inhibiting miR-10b restores neuroﬁbromin expression
in SK-ES-1 cells (Fig. 6). It is possible that miR-10b selectively
and speciﬁcally targets neuroﬁbromin to regulate NF1 tumori-
genesis and progression. Studies of Nf1 knockout embryos
(Nf1) ⁄ )) show that mutant Nf1 gene is transcribed into stable
Nf1 mRNA, even in the absence of exon 31, and that mutated
Nf1 mRNA is translated into a truncated protein.(37) It is not
known if the truncated protein is functional, or if this phenome-
non is relevant to human NF1 tumorigenesis. As long as the
NF1 mRNA is expressed, miR-10b can target its 3¢UTR to sup-
press protein expression. Similar to unequal expression of NF1
alleles and NF1 mRNA editing, miRNAs such as miR-10b may
serve as an alternative for LOH of the NF1 to regulate neuroﬁ-
bromin expression, and consequently regulate NF1 tumorigene-
sis and progression. On the other hand, miR-10b may also target
other genes and signaling pathways to regulate NF1 tumorigene-
sis and progression. We showed that forced expression of miR-
10b in 293T cells induced a higher phosporylated ERK level
(Fig. 7), whereas miR-10b inhibitors corrected abnormal phosp-
orylated ERK responses in the NF1 MPNST cell line ST88-14
(Fig. 5),
indicating that miR-10b modulates RAS signaling.
miR-10b has also been found to inhibit translation of mRNA
encoding the protein Homeobox D10 (HOXD10) resulting in
increased expression of a pro-metastatic gene, Ras homolog
gene family, member C (RHOC).(30) RHOC belongs to the Rho
family of GTPases. It has been shown that each of Rho GTPas-
es, including RHOC, is required for RAS-induced transforma-
tion.(38–41) RAS-induced transformation can be blocked by
pharmacologic inhibition of Rho kinase (ROCK), a key Rho
effector.(42) Therefore, miR-10b may target other molecules at
the RAS signaling pathway, such as RHOC(30 or RAP2A, phos-
phatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and Ras homolog gene
family, member V (RHOV) (Table 2) to modulate RAS signal-
ing. Hyperactivation of the RAS signaling pathway has been
reported to play critical roles in the development of NF1 related
tumors.(43–47) We speculate that miR-10b may modulate RAS
signaling pathway, and thus regulate NF1 tumorigenesis and
progression.

Although our data suggest that miR-10b may have an impor-
tant role in NF1 tumorigenesis and tumor progression, a ques-
tion is whether miR-10b alone is sufﬁcient to promote NF1
tumorigenesis. Other miRNAs, including miR-155, miR-335,
let-7a, and let-7b, were also signiﬁcantly deregulated in NF1
MPNST cells and ⁄ or tissues, but not in NF1 benign neuroﬁbro-
mas. Changes in expression of these miRNAs may contribute to
the pathogenesis of MPNSTs, or may just be a consequence of
tumor formation. While inhibiting miR-155 did not correct any
abnormal growth behaviors of NF1 MPNST cells, inhibiting
miR-335 or enhancing let-7a expression partially corrected some
abnormal growth properties of these tumor cells. These ﬁndings
suggest that changes in miR-155 may represent a consequence
of NF1 MPNST tumor formation, while changes in miR-335
and let-7 expression may contribute to progression of NF1
MPNSTs. These speculations are supported by the observation
that RAS and Tenascin C are deregulated in NF1 MPNSTs.(48)
miR-335 targets SOX4 and Tenascin C,(34) and let-7 down-regu-
lates expression of RAS proto-oncogene and high-mobility group
A2 (HMGA2).(35,49) We speculate miR-10b may cooperate with
other miRNAs, such as miR-335, let-7, and early reported miR-
34a (36) to promote NF1 tumorigenesis and progression. These
