The neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene encodes the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) neuroﬁbromin,
which negatively regulates Ras activity. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two neuroﬁbromin homologs,
Ira1 and Ira2. To understand how these proteins are regulated, we utilized an unbiased proteomics approach
to identify Ira2 and neuroﬁbromin binding partners. We demonstrate that the Gpb1/Krh2 protein binds and
negatively regulates Ira2 by promoting its ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. We extended our ﬁndings to show
that in mammalian cells, the ETEA/UBXD8 protein directly interacts with and negatively regulates neuroﬁ-
bromin. ETEA contains both UBA and UBX domains. Overexpression of ETEA downregulates neuroﬁbromin
in human cells. Puriﬁed ETEA, but not a mutant of ETEA that lacks the UBX domain, ubiquitinates the
neuroﬁbromin GAP-related domain in vitro. Silencing of ETEA expression increases neuroﬁbromin levels and
downregulates Ras activity. These ﬁndings provide evidence for conserved ubiquitination pathways regulating
the RasGAP proteins Ira2 (in yeast) and neuroﬁbromin (in humans).

Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant
genetic disease that affects 1 in 3,500 individuals worldwide.
Individuals with NF1 are predisposed to develop multiple be-
nign and malignant neuroﬁbromas as well as gliomas, pheo-
chromocytomas, and myeloid leukemias (2, 32). Neuroﬁbro-
min, the NF1 gene product, negatively regulates Ras activity by
facilitating the hydrolysis of active RasGTP to inactive Ras-
GDP through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain (3,
25). Loss of neuroﬁbromin results in hyperactive Ras signaling
and activation of downstream effectors, including the Raf–
MEK–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phos-
phatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT pathways (35, 45).

Regulation of neuroﬁbromin itself is still poorly understood.
Phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) increases in the
RasGAP activity in response to epidermal growth factor
(EGF) signaling (24). Furthermore, neuroﬁbromin can be
phosphorylated on serine residues when IgM is cross-linked,
although the kinase that is responsible for the regulation is
unknown (5). Neuroﬁbromin can be degraded by the protea-
some when cells are stimulated with growth factors that acti-
vate both G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine
kinases (7). Although neuroﬁbromin is ubiquitinated and de-
graded, the ubiquitin-related enzyme responsible remains to
be identiﬁed. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that neu-
roﬁbromin is controlled by both protein kinases and ubiquitin-
related enzymes and that identifying new protein candidates

that regulate neuroﬁbromin is crucial to advancing the under-
standing of NF1.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are two NF1-like
genes, IRA1 and IRA2, which encode Ira1 and Ira2 proteins,
respectively. Ira proteins are negative regulators of Ras1 and
Ras2 and were ﬁrst identiﬁed as components of the adenylyl
cyclase-cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway
(40). Deletion of Ras1 and Ras2 in yeast cells causes a G0
arrest due to lack of adenylyl cyclase activity. However, hyper-
activation of Ras, either by IRA gene deletion or by expression
of activated RAS alleles, activates the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-
PKA pathway. Constitutive Ras activation causes yeast cells to
die at high temperature. The Ras-induced heat shock sensitiv-
ity is reversed when the GAP domain of human neuroﬁbromin
is expressed in the ira-deleted yeast strains (3, 43). In yeast,
addition of glucose can trigger activation of adenylyl cyclase
activity via the Gpr1/Gpa2 pathway (10, 11). Recently, re-
ported studies showed that glucose stimulation increases Ras-
GTP levels in yeast (11, 34). Similarly, deletion of GPR1 or
GPA2 causes Ras activation, suggesting that the Gpr1/Gpa2
pathway might regulate Ras activity (11). Gpr1 binds to the G␣
subunit Gpa2 and its G␤-like subunits Gpb1/Krh2 and Gpb2/
Krh1 to control adenylyl cyclase activity (16). Gpb1/Krh2 and
Gpb2/Krh1 both possess C-terminal Kelch repeat domains but
have unique N-terminal domains (13, 16). The Kelch repeat
domain is predicted to have a protein folding similar to that of
the WD40 repeat domain that is commonly found in GPCR
G␤ subunits, TAFII transcription factors, and E3 ubiquitin
ligases (19, 30). A role for Gpb1/Krh2 and Gpb2/Krh1 in the
positive regulation of Ira proteins has been proposed, but the
molecular mechanism responsible for this regulation remains
unknown (15).

To better understand Ira/neuroﬁbromin function, we initi-
ated an unbiased proteomic puriﬁcation approach to identify

Biosystems) (14).

novel Ira/neuroﬁbromin binding proteins. We identiﬁed that
proteins containing ubiquitin-associated domains can nega-
tively regulate Ira2 and neuroﬁbromin. In yeast, we found that
Gpb1/Krh2 negatively regulates and promotes Ira2 degrada-
tion (we will refer to Gpb1/Krh2 as Gpb1). Similarly, we iden-
tiﬁed ETEA as a human ubiquitin-associated protein that neg-
atively regulates neuroﬁbromin levels. RNA interference
(RNAi) targeting of ETEA expression caused an upregulation
of neuroﬁbromin, reduced Ras activities, and downregulated
both the ERK and the AKT pathways. Therefore, these data
reveal critical conserved ubiquitination pathways that regulate
the RasGAP proteins Ira2 (in yeast) and neuroﬁbromin (in
humans).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Strains and plasmids. All of the yeast strains described in this article are listed
in Table 1. The double-epitope-tagged strains described in this article were
generated from the TAP-tagged parental strains, and the second gene was
epitope tagged using PCR-based FLAG tagging techniques previously described
(22). All plasmid constructs used in this article were generated by standard PCR
targeting techniques and cloned into Gateway entry and destination vectors
(Invitrogen).

Tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation and mass spectrometry. Yeast cells endogenously
expressing either IRA2-TAP or GPB1-TAP or 293T cells expressing TAP-NF1
fragments were used for the tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation (TAP) experiments. The
puriﬁcation scheme was adapted from references 14 and 33. Brieﬂy, either yeast
cell extracts from 6 to 10 litters of cells grown to log phase and expressing
Ira2-TAP or Gpb1-TAP or lysates from 293T stably expressed NF1-TAP frag-
ments were incubated at 4°C with 500 ␮l of packed IgG-conjugated glutathione
resin (Amersham). Resin beads were washed, and protein complexes were then
eluted from the IgG resin in calmodulin binding buffer supplemented with 50
units of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (Invitrogen). The second round of
afﬁnity puriﬁcation was performed using 400 ␮l of calmodulin resin (Amersham).
The protein complexes were then eluted with 2 200-␮l volumes of elution buffer,
precipitated, and separated by precast PAGE. Separated protein bands were
excised and digested with trypsin and analyzed for matched protein sequences
against the protein database. The experimental methods for protein band se-
quencing analysis were described previously (33).

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Total cell lysates were prepared in
cell lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40,
50 mM NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM Na3VO4, and a protease inhib-
itor cocktail (this buffer is hereinafter referred to as “lysis buffer”). After nor-
malization of protein concentrations, approximately 300 to 500 ␮g of total pro-

tein samples was immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. Sample
mixtures were rotated at 4°C for 2 h. After three washes with the lysis buffer, the
proteins bound to beads were released by boiling in 40 ␮l of 1⫻ SDS-PAGE
sample buffer for 10 min. All the immunoprecipitation experiments performed
were done with normalized protein concentrations. The samples were then
resolved by precast PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using the indicated
antibodies. Densitometry of the resulting bands was done by using Bio-Rad
Quantity One software (Hercules, CA), and protein amounts were corrected
based on actin values. The ﬁnal values presented are averages of results from
three independent densitometry experiments.

In vitro translation. The TNT quick coupled transcription/translation system
(Promega) was used to detect in vitro protein-protein interactions. All experi-
ments described were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In
vitro reactions involving [35S]methionine labeling were terminated by adding 500
␮l lysis buffer. Antibodies and conjugated beads were added to the radioactive
protein mixture, and immunoprecipitation was performed. The beads were
washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The proteins bound to beads were
released by boiling in 50 ␮l of 1⫻ SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min. The
samples were then resolved by precast PAGE, followed by visualization with a
Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).

In vitro ubiquitination of Ira2 and the neuroﬁbromin GRD. Gpb1-TAP com-
plexes were puriﬁed as described previously except that the ﬁnal calmodulin
binding step was omitted from the Gpb1 complex preparation. The reactions
were carried out at 30°C for 1.5 h in 50 ␮l reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2) containing 2 or 4 ␮g of ubiquitin (U-100; Boston
Biochem) or 4 ␮g of mutant ubiquitin (ubiØ), 5 mM ATP, a complex consisting
of 1.5 ␮g/ml activated E1 and 20 ␮g/ml UbcH5, and a complex consisting of
puriﬁed Flag-Ira2 and 200 ␮g of TAP-cleaved puriﬁed Gpb1 protein as E3
sources. The reactions were terminated by adding 500 ␮l lysis buffer. After
addition of 20 ␮l of M2 Flag agarose-conjugated beads, the samples were rotated
at 4°C for 2 h. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of pulldown buffer,
followed by three washes with 1⫻ phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The proteins
bound to Flag beads were released by boiling in 50 ␮l of 1⫻ SDS-PAGE sample
buffer. The samples were then resolved by precast PAGE, followed by immuno-
blotting using anti-His or anti-Flag antibodies.

For the ubiquitin assay of the neuroﬁbromin GAP-related domain (GRD), an
in vitro-[35S]methionine-labeled neuroﬁbromin GRD was immunoprecipitated
with glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads and used as substrates. The reactions
were carried out at 30°C for 1.5 h in 50 ␮l reaction buffer (same as above) con-
taining 10 ␮g of ubiquitin (U-100; Boston Biochem), 5 mM ATP, a complex
consisting of 1.5 ␮g/ml activated E1 and 20 ␮g/ml UbcH5, and a complex
consisting of 100 ␮g of puriﬁed green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-glutathione
S-transferase (GST), ETEA-GFP, or ETEA ⌬UBX protein. The reactions were
terminated by adding 500 ␮l lysis buffer. Samples were immunoprecipitated at
4°C for 2 h. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and then
three times with 1⫻ PBS. The [35S]methionine-labeled neuroﬁbromin GRD

complexes were released by boiling in 50 ␮l of 1⫻ SDS-PAGE sample buffer for
10 min. The samples were then resolved by NuPAGE, followed by visualization
with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager.

Cycloheximide chase experiments. To examine the effect of Gpb1 on Ira2
stability, exponentially growing wild-type (WT) or gpb1⌬ yeast strains were
treated with cycloheximide at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 mg/ml to inhibit de novo
protein synthesis. Cells were collected and washed at the time points indicated.
Total cell extracts were prepared, and the protein concentrations were deter-
mined. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting for Ira2 and Gpb1 with anti-
Flag or anti-TAP antibodies. To examine the effect of ETEA or ETEA UBX⌬ on
neuroﬁbromin stability, 293T cells were treated with cycloheximide at a ﬁnal
concentration of 150 ␮g/ml. Samples were terminated at the 0-, 4-, 8-, 12-, and
15-h time points as indicated. The protein concentrations were normalized, and
10 ␮g of total protein from each sample was immunoblotted with antineuroﬁ-
bromin, anti-GFP, anti-V5, and antiactin antibodies. Densitometry of the result-
ing bands was done by using Bio-Rad Quantity One software (Hercules, CA),
and protein amounts were corrected based on actin values. The ﬁnal values
presented are averages of results from three independent densitometry experi-
ments.

shRNAmir plasmids

shRNA stable cell lines. 293T or BT459 cells were seeded in 6-well dishes 24 h
prior to transient transfection with 4 ␮g of total short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
DNA plasmids using 10 ␮l of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). The three
human pSM2 retroviral
targeting ETEA (clones
V2HS_80576, V2HS_80578, and V2HS_80580) were purchased from Open Bio-
systems. In order to generate stable cell lines expressing the shRNA plasmids, 48
to 72 h after transfections, cells were replated in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) plus 1
␮g/ml puromycin for more than 10 days. Densitometry of the resulting bands was
done by using Bio-Rad Quantity One software (Hercules, CA), and protein
amounts were corrected based on actin values. The ﬁnal values presented were
averages of results from three independent densitometry experiments.

RasGTP detection. Total cellular extracts were prepared and used for immu-
noprecipitation with the GST-fused Ras binding domain-conjugated glutathione
resin. The experimental procedures were previously described (33). For yeast
RasGTP pulldown experiments, membranes were immunoblotted with anti-Ras2
antibody. For RasGTP pulldown experiments in 293T cells, the panRAS anti-
body was used to determine RasGTP levels.

RNA extraction and quantiﬁcation. Total RNA was isolated using a RiboPure
yeast kit from Ambion (catalog no. AM1024). Quantitative reverse transcription-
PCRs (qRT-PCRs) were run in triplicate using the ABI Prism 7500 sequence
detector system by using SYBR green qPCR master mix (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The level of each transcript was quantiﬁed by the ⌬⌬CT
method, and expression of ACT1 was used as an internal control for all of the
samples. The levels of HSP12, CTT1, and GPB1 expression are indicated as
n-fold increases relative to the levels for HSP12, CTT1, and GPB1 expression in
WT cells and cells receiving control plasmids grown under the same conditions.
The average values for WT cells and cells receiving control plasmids were
normalized to 1. The experiments were performed and repeated with two sets of
primers per gene to exclude nonspeciﬁc activity.

Reagents and antibodies. MG132 was from Calbiochem. Anti-Flag M2 (un-
conjugated) and anti-Flag M2 conjugated beads were from Sigma. Anti-Ydj1
(sc-23749), anti-NF1 (sc-67), anti-GFP (sc-8334), antihemagglutinin (anti-HA)
(sc-805), anti-p120GAP, and anti-RAS2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Antiubiquitin antibodies were from Zymed and Abcam. Anti-V5 was from Ab-
cam. Anti-Ras (panRas) was from BD Biosciences. Antiactin was from Sigma.
Recombinant ubiquitin proteins were from Boston Biochem.

RESULTS

Analysis of Ira2-TAP fusion protein and puriﬁcation of Ira2
binding partners. To identify protein complexes that bind to
Ira2, we utilized a yeast strain with endogenous Ira2 fused at
the C terminus with the TAP tag. We characterized the IRA2-
TAP yeast strain to determine whether the TAP-tagged fusion
protein interfered with Ira2 activity. Western blotting showed
that the IRA2-TAP yeast strain endogenously expressed the
Ira2-TAP fusion protein (Fig. 1A). Loss of Ira2 activates Ras
and results in heat sensitivity (37, 38). Therefore, we examined
whether loss of the Ira2-TAP protein would result in heat
shock sensitivity. We generated an ira2 mutant strain (ira2-

TAP⌬) and compared its heat sensitivity to that of the IRA2-
TAP and wild-type strains. Figure 1B (rows 2 and 4) shows that
the IRA2-TAP yeast strain has a heat shock phenotype similar
to that observed in wild-type cells but that the ira2-TAP⌬ yeast
strain has a heat-sensitive phenotype (row 1). We conclude
that the IRA2-TAP strain is functional compared to the non-
fusion IRA2 wild-type strain and that the TAP-tagged fusion
protein does not impair Ira2 activity.

Next, we performed a tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation of Ira2-
TAP protein. Cell extracts from the IRA2-TAP cells were iso-
lated as described previously (14), and after two rounds of
afﬁnity puriﬁcation, protein complexes bound to the Ira2-TAP
protein were separated by gel electrophoresis, digested with
trypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (Fig. 1C and Table 2). The data revealed both
previously known and novel binding partners of Ira2. We
found both Ira1 and Ira2 in the mass spectrometry analysis as
well as the chaperone MSI3, which had previously been re-
ported to bind to Ira2. Rim15, a component of the Ras-cAMP
pathway, was also bound to Ira2 (36, 39). Proteins involved
with glycolysis and the production of ATP, including pyruvate
kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, the ATP synthase beta sub-
unit, and ADP/ATP carrier protein 2, were found in the Ira2-
bound complex. Interestingly, we found that Ira2 binds to
prohibitin, an evolutionarily conserved protein required for
Ras-induced c-Raf activation in mammalian cells (31). Fur-
thermore, Asc1, a yeast homolog of human RACK1 which
contains WD40 repeats, also binds to Ira2. PKC has been
shown to regulate neuroﬁbromin and Ras signaling in mam-
malian systems (24). Interestingly, Asc1 has recently been
shown to function as a G␤ subunit for Gpa2 (44). Of interest
is the G␤ mimic Kelch repeat protein 1 (Gpb1), which we
found to be abundantly bound to Ira2.

Recently, Gpb1 and Gpb2 were identiﬁed as components of
the Ras signaling pathway in yeast on the basis of their inter-
action with Ira1 and Ira2. It was reported that deletions of the
GPB1 and GPB2 genes resulted in Ira protein instability and a
marked increase in RasGTP levels, and therefore, it was pro-
posed that Gpb1/2 positively regulate Ira1 and Ira2 activity
(15). Ras activation is usually associated with high cAMP levels
in yeast cells (40). However, when using yeast strains deﬁcient
in both GPB1 and GPB2, another group could not detect any
increase in cAMP levels (29). Since we found association be-
tween the Gpb1 and Ira2 proteins in the proteomic analysis, we
focused exclusively on the relationship between Gpb1 and Ira2.
We generated yeast strains that endogenously expressed both
Gpb1-TAP and Ira2-FLAG (IRA2-3FLAG/GPB1-TAP) and
veriﬁed protein expression by immunoblotting (Fig. 1D). We
conﬁrmed interactions between Ira2 and Gpb1 by performing
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments (Fig.
1E). Association between Ira2 and Gpb1 was further investi-
gated by in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation experi-
ments. GFP-tagged Gpb1 and V5-tagged Ira2 were in vitro
translated and immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 monoclonal
antibody. We found that Ira2 efﬁciently interacts with Gpb1 in
the in vitro translation and binding experiments (Fig. 1F).
Taken together, the results conﬁrm that Ira2 interacts with
Gpb1 both in vitro and in vivo.

Gpb1 negatively regulates Ira2. A previous study showed
that Gpb1 and Gpb2 positively regulate Ira1 and Ira2 (15);

FIG. 1. Characterization of the IRA2-TAP yeast strain and identiﬁcation of the Kelch repeat protein Gpb1 as a negative regulator of Ira2.
(A) Soluble extracts from cells expressing the indicated Ira2-HA or Ira2-TAP fusion proteins (replicate samples) were mixed with SDS-PAGE
sample buffer and resolved by NuPAGE (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted for the TAP fusion protein. An asterisk represents the different isoforms
of the Ira2-TAP protein with the predicted molecular masses. (B) Heat shock experiments were performed on yeast strains as indicated. Cells were
grown in a 30°C chamber for 3 days, replica plated, and either unexposed or exposed to a 55°C heat chamber. Photographs were taken 3 days after
heat exposure. The Ira2-TAP fusion protein is expressed under its endogenous promoter in a strain with IRA2 deleted by genetic homologous
recombination (row 1), a wild-type strain expressing the Ira2-TAP fusion protein (row 2), a wild-type strain expressing the Ira2-HA fusion protein
(row 3), and a wild-type strain that is not tagged (row 4) (strains VP2TPD2, IRA2TAP, IRA2HA, and S288c, respectively). (C) Ira2-TAP fusion
protein was copuriﬁed from the IRA2TAP yeast strain, and protein complexes were resolved by gel electrophoresis and identiﬁed by mass
spectrometry (Table 2). The control sample was from a wild-type yeast strain that was not tagged. (D) Yeast strains doubly expressed endogenous
Ira2-Flag and Gpb1-TAP fusion proteins. Western blots showed either the control yeast strain expressing Cct1-Flag or two different strains
expressing Gpb1-TAP/Ira2-Flag. The GPB1-TAP yeast strain was used to create the double-epitope-tagged GPB1-TAP/IRA2-3FLAG yeast strains
49 and 50 (strains VPG1TP2F, 49, and 50). The CCT1-3FLAG yeast strain was used as a control (VPCT13F). Genetic integration experiments were
performed using plasmids from a previously described publication (22). (E) Endogenous Gpb1 and Ira2 interaction. Yeast cells (strain VPG1TP2F)
expressing Gpb1-TAP and Ira2-Flag fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP), followed by Western blotting (WB) with anti-TAP (␣-TAP)
and anti-Flag antibodies as indicated. (F) Ira2 and Gpb1 interaction in vitro. Ira2-V5 and Gpb1-GFP were translated in vitro, subjected to
immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-V5 antibody, and visualized with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager.

however, in our experimental system, we found that deletion of
GPB1-TAP in the IRA2-3FLAG/GPB1-TAP yeast strain re-
sulted in a 3-fold increase in Ira2 compared to the level for the
wild-type strain (Fig. 2A). Since our results were contrary to

previously reported data (15), we repeated our genetic dele-
tions of the GPB1-TAP open reading frame (ORF) and ob-
tained two independent yeast strains that have deletions in the
GPB1 allele. Again, we found that gpb1⌬ mutants possessed

a Proteins were identiﬁed from two independent mass spectrometry experi-
ments using the Ira2-TAP fusion protein to pull down the protein complexes.

higher Ira2 protein levels than wild-type cells (Fig. 2A, lanes
marked 7 and 10). To test whether the GPB1-TAP strain might
contain suppressor genes or the Gpb1-TAP fusion protein that
could directly modulate Ira2 level and activity in the wild-type
strain (GPB1-TAP) might not be functional, we performed
qRT-PCR to detect the transcriptional activities of two stress
genes (CTT1 and HSP12) that had been described to be the
direct targets of Ras activation (4, 29). We found that the
transcription activities of CTT1 and HSP12 in a nontagged WT
strain and the GPB1-TAP strain are comparable, suggesting
that the GPB1-TAP strain behaves like a wild-type strain.
Importantly, we found that the CTT1 and HSP12 transcrip-
tional levels in the Ira2-deleted strain (GPB1-TAP ⌬ira2) are
greatly reduced (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we concluded that the
Gpb1-TAP fusion protein is functional and that the GPB1-
TAP strain does not contain suppressor genes that regulate
Ira2 stability. To further investigate the biological activity of
Gpb1 in the Ira2/Ras signaling pathway, we cloned GPB1 un-
der the GAL1 promoter. We reasoned that if Gpb1 is a neg-
ative regulator of Ira2 then overexpression of Gpb1 would
downregulate Ira2 and activate Ras. The pGAL1-GPB1-V5
construct was expressed in the IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬ strain. Af-
ter 3 h ofgalactose induction, we found that overexpression of
Gpb1-V5 extensively reduced Ira2 protein levels. Furthermore,
overexpression of Gpb1-V5 resulted in an increase in RasGTP
levels (Fig. 2C).

To further examine Gpb1 activity in vivo, we constructed
mutant yeast strains in which IRA1, IRA2 , orIRA1/IRA2 is
deleted. We overexpressed Gpb1 in these mutant strains and
examined their sensitivity to high temperature. We found that
expression of GPB1-V5 increased heat sensitivity in the ira1⌬/
IRA2 yeast strain compared to the level for a control plasmid
(Fig. 2D, ⴱ). We could not determine the level of heat sensi-
tivity in the ira2⌬/IRA1 mutant strain in the presence of Gpb1,
because of the higher degree of heat shock sensitivity in this

strain than in the ira1⌬/IRA2 strain in the same experiment
(Fig. 2D). One concern is whether the V5 peptide fused to
Gpb1 (pGAL-GPB1-V5) could interfere with the Gpb1 Kelch
domain and acts as dominant negative, thereby causing the
phenotypes that we observed. Therefore, we cloned the GPB1
open reading frame, including the stop codon encoding amino
acid (aa) 897 of Gpb1, into the pGAL plasmid, thereby pre-
venting the V5 protein fragment from fusing into Gpb1. When
the nontagged pGAL-GPB1 plasmid is overexpressed in a wild-
type yeast strain, we observed a heat shock sensitivity pheno-
type similar to that observed for a control plasmid (Fig. 2E).
This result is consistent with the heat shock phenotype that we
obtained when expressing the pGAL-GPB1-V5 plasmid (Fig.
2D and 3B). Furthermore, overexpression of the nontagged
GPB1 construct greatly repressed CTT1 and HSP12 transcrip-
tion activities, indicative of Ras activation (Fig. 2F). To further
demonstrate that the Gpb1-V5 or Gpb1-TAP fusion proteins
functioned normally and that the C-terminally tagged fusion
proteins did not interfere with Gpb1 functions, we performed
genetic complementary experiments in the IRA2-3FLAG/
gpb1⌬ yeast strain to determine whether the GPB1-V5 and
GPB1-TAP constructs could restore Ira2 protein levels similar
to that of the nontagged GPB1 wild-type construct. Figure 2G
shows that expression of either wild-type GPB1, GPB1-V5 , or
GPB1-TAP under the GPB1 endogenous promoter fully re-
stored Ira2 protein levels in the mutant IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬
yeast strain. Given these results, we believe that C-terminal
tagged V5 or TAP fusion proteins do not interfere with normal
Gpb1 functions and that the pGAL-GPB1-V5 construct is func-
tionally similar to the wild-type construct.

To further address the idea that overexpression of Gpb1
could induce heat shock sensitivity and activate Ras signaling
in yeast, we generated a mutant construct that lacks the N-
terminal domain, Gpb1 N⌬. We found that overexpression of
Gpb1 N⌬ failed to induce the heat shock phenotype usually
associated with Ras activation (Fig. 3B). Further, overexpres-
sion of Gpb1 N⌬ caused an increase in HSP12 transcriptional
activity compared to the level for a control plasmid, suggesting
that deletion of the Gpb1 N-terminal domain hinders Gpb1
activity (Fig. 3C). Taken together, our results demonstrate that
Gpb1 is a negative regulator of Ira2.

Gpb1 and Gpb2 have opposite functions. Previous reports
suggested that Gpb1 and Gpb2 positively regulate Ira proteins
in yeast (15, 16). However, we observed that Gpb1 negatively
regulates endogenous Ira2 protein levels when overexpressed
in cells (Fig. 2C) and that Ira2 is upregulated in gpb1⌬ cells
(Fig. 2A). Gpb1 and Gpb2 possess similar Kelch repeat do-
mains at their C termini (35% homology) but contain unique
N-terminal domains. To determine whether Gpb2 possesses
functions similar to those of Gpb1 in regulating Ira2 activity,
we overexpressed pGAL1-GPB1-V5 and pGAL1-GPB2-V5 in
the IRA2-3FLAG/gpb⌬ yeast strain (VP2.3FDG1) and per-
formed immunoblotting experiments to determine the Ira2
protein levels. We found that Gpb2 overexpression modestly
increases Ira2 levels but that overexpression of Gpb1 down-
regulates Ira2 (Fig. 4A). To further investigate the differences
between Gpb1 and Gpb2 in vivo, we overexpressed a control,
pGAL1-GPB1-V5 , or pGAL1-GPB2-V5 plasmid in the wild-
type, ira2⌬/IRA1, ira1⌬/IRA2 , orira1⌬ ira2⌬ strain (W303,
VPD1, VPD2, or VPD1.2, respectively) and assessed the heat

FIG. 2. Gpb1 negatively regulates Ira2 in yeast. (A) Gpb1 deletion increases Ira2 levels. Lysates from either wild-type (WT) or gpb1⌬ (lanes
marked 7 and 10) cells were normalized and subjected to Western blotting with anti-Flag or anti-TAP antibodies (S288c, VP2.3FDG1.7, or
VP2.3FDG1.10, respectively). The membrane was blotted with anti-Ras2 antibody to control for equal protein loading. Ira2 protein levels were
quantiﬁed from three independent experiments with either the wild-type (WT) strain or gpb1⌬ mutants and are expressed as means ⫾ standard
errors of the means. (B) Gpb1-TAP fusion protein is functionally normal and does not activate Ras-targeted genes. The expression levels of CTT1,
HSP12, GPB1, and ACT1 (as an internal standard) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The wild-type parental strain S288c (ATCC 201388;
MATa his2⌬1 leu2⌬0 met15⌬ ura3⌬0) or theGPB1-TAP or GPB1-TAP ira2⌬ (VPG1TPD2) strain was grown, and RNA was extracted as described
in Materials and Methods. (C) Gpb1 overexpression decreases Ira2 stability and activates Ras signaling. The pGAL-GPB1-V5 plasmid was
transformed into the IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬ yeast cells (VP2.3FDG1.7) endogenously expressing Ira2-Flag. Cells were induced with galactose for 3 h
and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Flag and anti-V5 antibodies to determine protein levels. The lower panel shows Ras2GTP levels in cells
overexpressing Gpb1-V5. Pulled-down RasGTP samples from total lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Ras2 antibody. Total Ras2
levels were subjected to Western blotting for comparison. Ras2GTP levels in wild-type (WT) cells and wild-type cells with Gpb1 overexpression
(WT⫹Gpb1) were quantiﬁed from three independent experiments and are expressed as means ⫾ standard errors of the means. (D) Overexpres-
sion of Gpb1-V5 in the ira1⌬/IRA2 mutant yeast strain causes heat sensitivity. Galactose induced expression of Gpb1 in either ira2⌬/IRA1,
ira1⌬/IRA2, ira1⌬/ira2⌬, or wild-type yeast cells (VPD1, VPD2, VPD1.2, or W303, respectively). To assay for heat shock sensitivity, cells were
replica plated onto GAL-Ura3 plates and exposed to a high-temperature chamber (55°C) for 60 min or unexposed to a heat chamber (30°C). Plates
were then cooled at room temperature for 30 min and incubated at 30°C for 3 to 7 days before pictures were taken. (E, F) Overexpression of
full-length nontagged GPB1 in the W303 wild-type strain causes heat sensitivity and suppresses Ras-targeted genes. Galactose-induced expression
of Gpb1 causes heat sensitivity in WT cells compared to the level for cells that received an empty plasmid. The ira1⌬/ira2⌬ mutant strain (VPD1.2)
is included as a control. To assay for heat shock sensitivity, cells were replica plated onto GAL-Ura3 plates and exposed to a high-temperature
chamber (55°C) for 60 min or unexposed to a heat chamber (30°C). Plates were then cooled at room temperature for 30 min and incubated at 30°C
for 3 to 7 days before pictures were taken. For quantitative qRT-PCR, W303 wild-type (WT) cells that had received nontagged GPB1 or control
plasmids were grown overnight and galactose induced for 3 h todetermine the expression of CTT1, HSP12, GPB1, and ACT1 (as an internal
standard). (G) Expression of Gpb1, Gpb1-V5, or Gpb1-TAP under the GPB1 endogenous promoter in the IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬ yeast strain
restored Ira2 protein levels (strain VP2.3FDG1). The IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬ was transformed with a control plasmid or plasmids expressing
endogenous GPB1, GPB1-V5 , orGPB1-TAP. The three constructs were expressed under the control of the endogenous GPB1 promoter. Total cell
lysates with equal protein concentrations were subjected to immunoblotting (WB) with anti-Flag, anti-TAP, or anti-V5 antibodies. The membrane
was blotted using anti-Ydj1 antibodies to control for equal protein loading.

FIG. 4. Gpb1 and Gpb2 have opposite functions. (A) Overexpres-
sion of Gpb2 positively regulates Ira2 activity. pGAL-Gpb2-V5 (2nd
lane) or pGAL-Gpb1-V5 (4th lane) was overexpressed in the IRA2-
FLAG yeast strain, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting
(WB) with anti-Flag or anti-V5 antibodies to detect Ira2, Gpb2, or
Gpb1 protein levels. The membrane was blotted using anti-Ydj1 anti-
bodies to control for equal protein loading. (B) Overexpression of
Gpb2-V5 in the ira2⌬ IRA1 mutant yeast strain causes heat shock
resistance. The heat shock sensitivities of the indicated yeast strains,
expressing galactose-inducible GPB1 or GPB2 and a control plasmid,
were compared. Controls cells were either from the ira1⌬ ira2⌬ double
mutant or from wild-type cells. To assay for heat shock sensitivity, cells
were replica plated onto GAL-Ura3 plates and exposed to a high-
temperature chamber (55°C) for 60 min or unexposed to a heat cham-
ber (30°C). Plates were then cooled at room temperature for 30 min
and incubated at 30°C for 3 to 7 days before pictures were taken.

functions and that Gpb1 is a negative regulator of Ira2. Since
we identiﬁed Gpb1 complexes with Ira2 in our proteomic anal-
ysis, we further characterize Gpb1 functions in association with
Ira2.

Gpb1 controls Ira2 stability during glucose stimulation. In
yeast, glucose stimulation activates the G-protein-coupled re-
ceptor Gpr1, which induces adenylyl cyclase activity (11). Glu-
cose-induced activation of Gpr1 stimulates pathways that are
critical for cell metabolism and growth (21). Glucose can also
induce RasGTP loading in yeast (11, 34). Since Ira2 negatively
regulates Ras activity, we hypothesized that in the event of
rapid Ras activation induced by stimulation by a nutrient such
as glucose, Ira2 protein levels would be tightly regulated. As
demonstrated by Cichowski and coworkers, neuroﬁbromin is
rapidly degraded upon growth factor stimulation via the ubiq-
uitin-proteasome pathway in mammalian cells (7).

We therefore investigated whether Ira2 is downregulated by
glucose stimulation. We treated IRA2-3FLAG/GPB1-TAP cells
with 5% glucose, and Ira2 levels were assessed by immunoblot
analysis. Glucose stimulation triggered Ira2 downregulation
within 10 minutes, and a further decrease was observed at 15
min. Interestingly, glucose-induced downregulation of Ira2 was

with anti-V5 antibody. (B) Galactose-induced expression of pGAL-
GPB1-V5 results in heat sensitivity in W303 wild-type yeast cells com-

replica plated onto GAL-Ura3 plates and exposed to a high-temper-
ature chamber (55°C) for 60 min or unexposed to a heat chamber
(30°C). Plates were then cooled at room temperature for 30 min and
incubated at 30°C for 3 to 7 days before pictures were taken. (C) Tran-

quantitative RT-PCR. Cells were grown and galactose induced for 3 h

sensitivity of these. As expected, we found that overexpression
of Gpb1 increases heat sensitivity but that overexpression of
Gpb2 causes heat resistance in ira2⌬/IRA1 cells (Fig. 4B). This
ﬁnding suggests that Gpb1 and Gpb2 might have opposite

FIG. 5. Gpb1 targets Ira2 for proteasomal degradation in response to glucose. (A) Ira2 is downregulated in response to glucose stimulation.
IRA2-3FLAG/GPB1-TAP cells (strain VPG1TP2F) were grown to log phase in rich medium overnight and switched to glucose-free medium for
4 to 6 h before 5% glucose stimulation. Ira2 and Gpb1 protein levels were detected by immunoblotting using anti-Flag and anti-TAP antibodies.
The membrane was blotted with anti-Ydj1 antibody to control for equal protein loading. (B) Ubiquitination of endogenous Ira2-Flag in vivo.
IRA2-3FLAG/GPB1-TAP cells (strain VPG1TP2F) were either untreated (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) or treated with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 (10 ␮M). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody and immunoblotted (WB) with either antiubiquitin or anti-Flag
antibodies. (C) Cycloheximide chase assay of Ira2 in wild-type (WT) and gpb1⌬ (VPG1TP2F and VP2.3FDG1.7, respectively) yeast strains. Ira2
and Gpb1 protein levels were detected by immunoblotting using anti-Flag and anti-TAP antibodies. The membrane was immunoblotted with
anti-Ras2 antibody to control for equal protein loading. Protein levels of Ira2 were quantiﬁed and are shown for the indicated time points.

accompanied by a gradual elevation of Gpb1 protein levels
(Fig. 5A).

Because glucose stimulation or overexpression of Gpb1
downregulated endogenous Ira2, we hypothesized that Gpb1
might be responsible for Ira2 stability and that Ira2 might be
ubiquitin modiﬁed and degraded to permit rapid Ras activa-
tion. To investigate whether Ira2 is a target of the ubiquitina-
tion machinery, we treated IRA2-3FLAG/GPB1-TAP cells
with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, immunoprecipitated
Ira2, and immunoblotted with an antiubiquitin antibody. We
detected Ira2 ubiquitination after 4 h of MG132 treatment
(Fig. 5B).

To test the role of Gpb1 in Ira2 stability, we examined the
degradation rate of Ira2 levels in wild-type and gpb1⌬ mutant

cells. Endogenous Ira2 was rapidly downregulated in cyclohex-
imide-treated wild-type cells, while Ira2 was stabilized in gpb1⌬
mutant cells (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that glucose stim-
ulation induced downregulation of Ira2, possibly by triggering
Gpb1-mediated Ira2 ubiquitination and degradation, and con-
ﬁrmed our hypothesis that Gpb1 controls Ira2 stability.

Gpb1 is required for Ira2 ubiquitination and degradation.
Gpb1 has a unique N-terminal domain (amino acids 1 to 220)
that is not conserved in Gpb2 (16) and a seven ␤-propeller
Kelch repeat domain at its C terminus (amino acids 292 to
816). Previous reports suggest that proteins containing the
ubiquitin-like (UBL) and UBA domains can bind to and de-
liver ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for protein deg-
radation. In addition, the Kelch repeat domain has a structure

FIG. 6. Full-length Gpb1 targets Ira2 for protein degradation. (A) Diagrams showed the different Gpb1 fragments that were constructed to
determine binding to Ira2. Expression levels of full-length Gpb1 and truncated Gpb1 fragments binding to Ira2 are shown. All of the constructed
full-length (WT) and truncated Gpb1 fragments were expressed in the IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬ yeast strain (VP2.3FDG1) and galactose induced for
3 h to determine Gpb1 expressions and interactions with Ira2. In particular, the Gpb1 Kelch⌬ fragment is expressed, as seen in row 4, compared
to the level for cells receiving control plasmid (CT). Lysates were collected and immunoblotted with anti-V5 antibody or were subjected to
immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Flag and immunoblotted (WB) with anti-Flag and anti-V5 antibodies. (B) Gpb1 targets Ira2 for ubiquitination.
Overexpression of the Gpb1-V5 wild-type (left), Kelch⌬ (middle), or N⌬ (right) protein was induced in the IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬ yeast strain
(VP2.3FDG1.7) by treating cells with galactose at the indicated time points (0 to 3 h). Lysates were collected, subjected to immunoprecipitation
(IP) with anti-Flag antibody, and immunoblotted (WB) with antiubiquitin, anti-Flag, and anti-V5 antibodies. (C) In vitro ubiquitination of Ira2.
The Ira2-Flag and Gpb1-TAP complexes were puriﬁed from the IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬ (VP2.3FDG1.7) and GPB1-TAP/ira2⌬ (VPG1TPD2F) yeast
strains, respectively, and subjected to an in vitro ubiquitination assay. Gpb1 ubiquitination activity was observed in reaction mixtures containing
recombinant wild-type His-ubiquitin (His-Ubi) but not in those without the Gpb1 complex, those that received His-ubiquitin with all the lysine
amino acids mutated (KØ), or those without E1 and E2. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h, immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Flag
antibody, and immunoblotted (WB) with anti-His or anti-Flag antibodies.

similar to that of the WD40 repeat domain, which is involved
in substrate recognition for ubiquitin ligase complexes (17, 41).
A recent ﬁnding also showed that the Kelch protein KLHL12
binds to the Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase to negatively regulate the
Wnt–␤-catenin pathway (1). We generated galactose-inducible
plasmids encoding full-length (WT), Kelch-deleted (Kelch⌬),
C-terminal domain-deleted (C⌬), and N-terminal domain-de-
leted (N⌬) Gpb1 and expressed these plasmids in the IRA2-
3FLAG/gpb1⌬ yeast strain. We conﬁrmed that the Gpb1 full-
length and truncated forms are expressed and interacted with
Ira2 by performing immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
experiments (Fig. 6A). To examine the role of Gpb1 in the
ubiquitination of Ira2 in vivo, we overexpressed Gpb1 WT,
Gpb1 Kelch⌬, and Gpb1 N⌬ in the IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬ yeast
strain at different time points after galactose induction and
collected cell lysates for immunoprecipitation and immuno-
blotting assays. Figure 6B shows that galactose-induced expres-
sion of full-length Gpb1 in the IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬ yeast strain
caused an increase in Ira2 ubiquitination in a Gpb1 dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 6B, WT). Surprisingly, neither the
Gpb1 Kelch⌬ nor the Gpb1 N⌬ fragment promoted Ira2 ubiq-
uitination (Fig. 6B, Kelch⌬ or N⌬), even though the wild-type,
Gpb1 Kelch⌬, and Gpb1 N⌬ fragments efﬁciently bind to Ira2.
These results suggest that the Kelch and the N domains of
Gpb1 are required for Ira2 ubiquitination.

To determine whether Gpb1 can efﬁciently conjugate ubiq-
uitin to Ira2 in vitro, we puriﬁed Ira2-Flag and Gpb1-TAP
fusion protein complexes from the IRA2-3FLAG/gpb1⌬ and
ira2⌬/GPB1-TAP mutant strains, respectively, and performed
in vitro ubiquitin conjugation experiments. We used extensively
washed, immunopuriﬁed Ira2-Flag as the substrate and puri-
ﬁed, TEV-cleaved Gpb1 as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
complex. After incubation with either recombinant His-ubiq-
uitin or a recombinant His-ubiquitin mutant (KØ) that has all
the lysine residues mutated, Ira2-Flag was immunoprecipitated
and immunoblotted with an anti-His antibody to detect Ira2-
conjugated His-ubiquitin chains. We found that puriﬁed Gpb1
complex can readily promote Ira2 polyubiquitination in vitro
(Fig. 6C). Given these results, we conclude that the Gpb1
complex ubiquitinates Ira2 in vivo and in vitro.

ETEA binds and negatively regulates neuroﬁbromin. Neu-
roﬁbromin can be targeted for proteasome-mediated degrada-
tion upon growth factor stimulation (7). We show here that
Ira2, the yeast homolog of neuroﬁbromin, is targeted for ubiq-
uitination and proteasomal degradation by Gpb1. Therefore,
we hypothesize that there is a functional equivalent to Gpb1 in

human cells that is responsible for neuroﬁbromin ubiquitina-
tion and degradation. To identify the human homologue of
Gpb1, we cloned neuroﬁbromin into eight different fragments
(Fig. 7D). With the exception of the GRD and SEC domains,
all the fragments were randomly designed and cloned. We
chose the GRD (fragment 4) and the SEC (fragment 5) do-
mains to perform the pulldown experiments to identify what
proteins interact with these two fragments (6, 12, 42). We then
analyzed the pulldown candidates by use of mass spectrometry.
Of the neuroﬁbromin binding partners in our analysis, we
found ETEA (UBXD8), which contains a UBA domain at its
N terminus and a UBX domain at its C terminus.

ETEA was ﬁrst cloned from CD3-positive blood cells of
patients with atopic dermatitis, an inﬂammatory skin condition
characterized by an elevation of eosinophils due to an inap-
propriate immune response (18). We compared amino acid
sequences between ETEA and Gpb1 and found that ETEA
and Gpb1 shared some similar amino acid sequences at the
N-terminal domains (aa 1 through 31); however, ETEA does
not contain a Kelch repeat domain that is present in Gpb1
(Fig. 7A).

To investigate whether ETEA can directly bind to neuroﬁ-
bromin, we expressed Flag-tagged ETEA in 293T cells and
performed immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experi-
ments. We found that ETEA directly binds to endogenous
neuroﬁbromin (Fig. 7B and C). To determine which domain of
neuroﬁbromin interacts with ETEA, we cotransfected Flag-
tagged neuroﬁbromin fragments (fragments 1 through 8) and
TAP-ETEA in 293T cells and performed immunoprecipitation
assays. Figure 7F shows the protein expression levels of the
different neuroﬁbromin Flag-tagged fragments. We found that
ETEA directly interacts with three neuroﬁbromin fragments
spanning amino acids 372 to 1552. The strongest interaction
was with fragment 4 (amino acids 1176 to 1552), which con-
tains the GAP-related domain. Although fragment 4 is highly
expressed, it seems that fragments 2, 3, and 4 speciﬁcally bind
to neuroﬁbromin (Fig. 7E). We also noticed that some of the
fragments were not expressed well when transfected into 239T
cells (Fig. 7F). This ﬁnding is consistent with the previous
observations in which neuroﬁbromin fragments containing the
neuroﬁbromin GRD were targeted for degradation by the pro-
teasome machinery (7). To investigate whether ETEA can
directly bind to the neuroﬁbromin GRD in vitro, we utilized a
rabbit reticulocyte-based coupled transcription/translation sys-
tem and performed immunoprecipitation experiments. We
found that the neuroﬁbromin GRD directly binds to ETEA

(see Fig. 9C). Therefore, the interaction between ETEA and
neuroﬁbromin is direct, and ETEA interacts with neuroﬁbro-
min within regions that were previously identiﬁed as critical for
neuroﬁbromin degradation (7).

Silencing of ETEA stabilizes neuroﬁbromin and downregu-
lates Ras activity. We next utilized short hairpin interfering
RNAs (shRNAs) to examine whether reducing the expression
of ETEA would stabilize neuroﬁbromin. We generated stable
cell lines expressing three different shRNA plasmids targeting
the human ETEA transcription sequences (Sh576, Sh578, and
Sh580; Open Biosystems). Compared to the level for control
cells, reduced ETEA expression by shRNA knockdown re-
sulted in an increase in neuroﬁbromin levels (Fig. 8A). Fur-
thermore, reduced ETEA transcription activity from three in-
dependent
in
neuroﬁbromin protein levels, conﬁrming that the results are
consistent and not due to nonspeciﬁc targets.

an increase

We next investigated whether reduction of ETEA expression
could downregulate Ras signaling. As shown in Fig. 8B, under
nonmitogenic growth conditions (serum concentrations of 0%
and 1%), reducing ETEA expression markedly downregulated
Ras signaling and reduced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 8B,
lanes 1 and 3 versus lanes 2 and 4). At serum concentrations of
5% and 10%, decreased ETEA expression in Sh578-expressing
cells modestly reduced basal ERK activity compared to the
level for control samples (Fig. 8B, lanes 5 and 7 versus lanes 6
and 8). However, RasGTP levels were greatly reduced at 5%
and 10% serum concentrations when ETEA was repressed in
Sh578-expressing cells (Fig. 8B, lanes 5 to 8). Reducing ETEA
expression in cells plated at a high serum concentration is more
effective in reducing Ras activity than in reducing ERK phos-
phorylation, possibly because Ras is a direct target of neuro-
ﬁbromin whereas ERK is further downstream and can be tar-
geted by multiple receptors that are unrelated to the NF1
pathway. Neuroﬁbromin loss of function leads to Ras activa-
tion and deregulation of both the ERK and the AKT pathways
(20). We next examined whether targeting ETEA expression
could reduce AKT phosphorylation in 293T and BT549 cell
lines. Both of these cell lines normally have high basal AKT
phosphorylation. We generated 293T and BT549 stable cell
lines expressing shRNA that targeted ETEA expression and
performed immunoblot analyses to examine AKT phosphory-
lation levels. As expected, reducing ETEA in both 293T and
BT549 cells resulted in upregulation of neuroﬁbromin and a
decrease in AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 8C). Taken together,
these results demonstrate that neuroﬁbromin stability is con-
trolled by ETEA and that reducing ETEA activity lowers Ras
activity and downregulates the ERK and AKT pathways. Fur-
thermore, the data also demonstrate that in cells that have

deregulation of AKT, reduced ETEA expression results in
downregulation of AKT activity.

The UBX domain of ETEA controls neuroﬁbromin down-
regulation. Since ETEA directly interacts with neuroﬁbromin
at amino acid sites that were previously identiﬁed as respon-
sible for neuroﬁbromin stability (7), we hypothesized that
ETEA targets neuroﬁbromin for ubiquitination and degrada-
tion. To investigate this possibility, we expressed ETEA-V5
(WT) in 293T and examined neuroﬁbromin levels. Overexpres-
sion of ETEA caused a decrease in endogenous neuroﬁbromin
protein levels (Fig. 9B). ETEA contains both UBA and UBX
domains, and while the UBA domain has been shown to bind
ubiquitinated substrates and deliver them to the proteasome
for protein degradation, the UBX domain has not been fully
characterized. Recently, ETEA was found to be an important
component of a degradation protein complex and seems to
play a role in the recruitment of the AAA ATPase p97. Fur-
thermore, the UBX domain of ETEA might be important for
interaction with the AAA ATPase p97 (26). To investigate the
mechanism by which ETEA regulates neuroﬁbromin, we gen-
erated full-length ETEA and a mutant of ETEA in which the
UBX domain is deleted. We overexpressed these constructs in
293T cells and assessed neuroﬁbromin protein levels. Overex-
pression of the ETEA mutant lacking the UBX domain
(ETEA UBX⌬) was less effective in reducing neuroﬁbromin
levels than overexpression of full-length ETEA (Fig. 9B). We
examined whether the UBX deletion construct could bind to
neuroﬁbromin. We expressed the neuroﬁbromin GRD frag-
ment in either wild-type or UBX-deleted ETEA in rabbit re-
ticulocyte lysates and then immunoprecipitated NF1-GRD to
assess coimmunoprecipitation of ETEA by immunoblotting.
Figure 9C shows that the neuroﬁbromin GRD binds efﬁciently
to both wild-type ETEA and ETEA UBX⌬.

We next investigated the neuroﬁbromin degradation rate by
expressing control, ETEA WT, or ETEA UBX⌬ plasmids in
293T cells. Cells were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit de
novo protein translation, and neuroﬁbromin levels were de-
tected by immunoblotting at the indicated times after treat-
ment. We found that the neuroﬁbromin half-life levels were
unchanged in control samples under cycloheximide treatments
from 1 to 15 h, suggesting that neuroﬁbromin is highly stable.
However, overexpression of wild-type ETEA reduced the neu-
roﬁbromin half-life to 8 h. Surprisingly, neuroﬁbromin levels
were fairly stable between 12 and 15 h. In contrast to wild-type
ETEA, ETEA UBX⌬ did not induce degradation of neuroﬁ-
bromin at the 4-h and 8-h time points (Fig. 9D), supporting our
previous observations that ETEA UBX⌬ failed to downregu-
late neuroﬁbromin (Fig. 9B). To examine whether ETEA in-
duced neuroﬁbromin ubiquitination, we puriﬁed GFP control,

performed at 30°C for 90 min. GST-GRD was coimmunoprecipitated (IP) with Sepharose-conjugated glutathione beads, separated by NuPAGE,
and visualized with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager. (F) Working model for controlling Ira2 and neuroﬁbromin stabilization by Gpb1 in yeast and

ETEA-GFP, or ETEA UBX⌬-GFP complexes from 293T cells
and performed in vitro ubiquitination assays with rabbit reticu-
locyte lysates expressing 35S-labeled neuroﬁbromin GRD. The
wild-type ETEA complex could readily ubiquitinate neuroﬁ-
bromin in vitro (Fig. 9E, lane 4), whereas both the GFP and the
ETEA UBX⌬-GFP complexes failed to ubiquitinate the neu-
roﬁbromin GRD (Fig. 9E, lanes 3 and 5). Given these results,
we conclude that the ETEA complex ubiquitinates and targets
neuroﬁbromin for degradation and that the UBX domain of
ETEA is critical for mediating the ubiquitination of neuroﬁ-
bromin.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we utilized an unbiased proteomic approach to
identify proteins that interact with and regulate Ira2 and neu-
roﬁbromin in an effort to identify the novel mechanisms by
which these important proteins are regulated. We identiﬁed
Gpb1 as a protein that binds to Ira2. We found that overex-
pression of Gpb1 resulted in downregulation of Ira2 but that
overexpression of Gpb2 increased Ira2 levels. These observa-
tions are in contrast to a reported study which showed that
overexpression of both Gpb1 and Gpb2 positively regulates
Ira1 and Ira2 and that deletions of ⌬gpb1 and ⌬gpb2 increase
RasGTP levels. (15). Other studies have reported inconsistent
ﬁndings in regard to Gpb1 and Gpb2 functions (27, 29). For
example, Ras activation results in downregulation in HSP12
transcription and causes an increase in cAMP levels. However,
at day 1 after cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dex-
trose (YPD), deletion of both gpb1 and gpb2 (⌬gpb1/⌬gpb2
yeast strain) did not cause a decrease in HSP12 transcription or
an increase in cAMP production (29). Since Gpb1 and Gpb2
possess similar Kelch repeats at the C-terminal domains but
have distinct N-terminal domains, we focused on the N-termi-
nal regions of Gpb1 and Gpb2 to identify differences in the
biological functions of the two proteins. Interestingly, we found
that the N-terminal domain of Gpb1 has some similarity to
ETEA amino acid sequences. Importantly, the N termini of
Gpb1 and Gpb2 do not have amino acid sequence similarity to
each other compared to the amino acid sequence similarity
between Gpb1 and ETEA.

Further, we demonstrated that overexpression of wild-type
Gpb1 is critical and sufﬁcient for Ira2 downregulation and Ras
activation by promoting ubiquitination of Ira2. Importantly, we
found that Ira2 downregulation as well as Ras activation is
dependent on the N-terminal domain of Gpb1. In contrast to
Gpb1, we found that Gpb2 positively regulates Ira2. Overex-
pression of Gpb2 modestly increased Ira2 levels, whereas over-
expression of Gpb1 had a negative effect on Ira2. Genetic
analysis showed that Gpb2 inhibited the heat shock phenotype
caused by loss of Ira2 in a heterozygous yeast strain, possibly by
causing an increase in Ira1 activity to downregulate active Ras.
Importantly, we also found that that overexpression of Gpb1
activates Ras and directly suppressed the expression of several
Ras-targeted genes, including CTT1 and HSP12. We addressed
the concerns that the Gpb1-TAP or the Gpb1-V5 fusion pro-
tein might act as dominant negative by monitoring Ras activity
in either the GPB1-TAP strain or W303 wild-type cells that
received galactose-induced Gpb1. We found that CTT1 and
HSP12 transcription levels were comparable between the non-

tagged wild-type and GPB1-TAP strains. Furthermore, galac-
tose-induced expression of a nontagged Gpb1 protein induced
a heat shock phenotype in the W303 wild-type strain as well as
depression of CTT1 and HSP12, indicative of Ras activation.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that Gpb1 negatively
regulates Ira2 and that Gpb1 and Gpb2 possess different bio-
logical functions.

There are several possible explanations for the differences in
Gpb1 and Gpb2 functions. One is that Gpb1 and Gpb2 might
have two completely different functions but share similar Kelch
repeat domains. Many proteins which share similar domain
structures but also have different functions have been identi-
ﬁed, including the small GTPase family of proteins (8). The
yeast S. cerevisiae has two RasGAP proteins, Ira1 and Ira2. In
addition to regulating Ras, previous reports have pointed out
that Ira1 and Ira2 can independently regulate different biolog-
ical pathways (23, 28). Gpb1 might target Ira2, whereas Gpb2
might target Ira1. Furthermore, proteomic experiments have
shown that Gpb1 and Gpb2 bind to different intracellular pro-
tein partners, suggesting that these proteins mediate indepen-
dent signaling pathways (9). Future experiments are needed to
address the differences between Gpb1 and Gpb2 functions.

Our working model is supported by previous observations
that neuroﬁbromin is negatively regulated by the ubiquitin
machinery when cells are stimulated with various growth fac-
tors (7). It was postulated that an E3 ligase is responsible for
targeting neuroﬁbromin degradation, resulting in rapid activa-
tion of Ras. Although the E3 ligase targeting neuroﬁbromin
for protein degradation was not identiﬁed, amino acid se-
quences adjacent to the GAP-related domain (GRD) of neu-
roﬁbromin have been identiﬁed and demonstrated to be criti-
cal sites for neuroﬁbromin degradation (7). We show here for
the ﬁrst time the identiﬁcation and functional analysis of a
previously unknown UBA-UBX protein that targets neuroﬁ-
bromin for protein degradation. Interestingly, ETEA appears
to share some amino acid sequences with the N-terminal do-
main of Gpb1 but not Gpb2. Loss-of-function analysis revealed
that ETEA function is critical for neuroﬁbromin stability. Al-
though more studies are needed to fully address the role of
ETEA in neuroﬁbromin regulation, our ﬁndings suggest that
interfering with ETEA function can increase neuroﬁbromin
levels and activity. Remarkably, reducing ETEA activity is ef-
fective in lowering active Ras and downregulating the Ras
downstream effectors, ERK and AKT. These results suggest
that inhibition of ETEA might present a novel opportunity for
therapeutic intervention.
