Abstract

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/
threonine protein kinase that exists in two complexes (mTORC1
and mTORC2) and integrates extracellular and intracellular
signals to act as a master regulator of cell growth, survival, and
metabolism. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR prosurvival pathway is often
dysregulated in multiple sarcoma subtypes. First-generation allo-
steric inhibitors of mTORC1 (rapalogues) have been extensively
tested with great preclinical promise, but have had limited clini-
cal utility. Here, we report that MLN0128, a second-generation,
ATP-competitive, pan-mTOR kinase inhibitor, acts on both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 and has potent in vitro and in vivo anti-
tumor activity in multiple sarcoma subtypes. In vitro, MLN0128
inhibits mTORC1/2 targets in a concentration-dependent fashion
and shows striking antiproliferative effect in rhabdomyosarcoma

(RMS), Ewing sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor,
synovial sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and liposarcoma. Unlike rapa-
mycin, MLN0128 inhibits phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and
NDRG1 as well as prevents the reactivation of pAKT that occurs
via negative feedback release with mTORC1 inhibition alone. In
xenograft models, MLN0128 treatment results in suppression of
tumor growth with two dosing schedules (1 mg/kg daily and 3
mg/kg b.i.d. t.i.w.). At the 3 mg/kg dosing schedule, MLN0128
treatment results in signiÔ¨Åcantly better tumor growth suppression
than rapamycin in RMS and Ewing sarcoma models. In addition,
MLN0128 induces apoptosis in models of RMS both in vitro and in
vivo. Results from our study strongly suggest that MLN0128
treatment should be explored further as potential therapy for
sarcoma. Mol Cancer Ther; 14(2); 395‚Äì406. √ì2014 AACR.

Introduction

mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that exists in two
distinct protein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) that regu-
lates metabolism, homeostasis, survival, and proliferation (1‚Äì3),
and is often dysregulated in multiple sarcoma subtypes (4‚Äì6).
Abnormal signals both upstream and downstream of the mTOR
kinase lead to aberrant activity in sarcomas, and its dysregulation
has been well documented by elevated phosphorylation of mul-
tiple components of the pathway (7‚Äì10). This deregulated activity
of mTOR and its surrounding axis have been shown to correlate

with poor clinical outcomes in sarcomas (11‚Äì13), as well as other
tumor types (14). Upstream, overexpression or constitutive acti-
vation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR; ref. 15),
insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFIR; refs. 16, 17), VEGFR
(18) and Ô¨Åbroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR; ref. 19), has
been demonstrated to play a role, while S6 kinase (S6K), and
eukaryotic initiation binding factor 4E (eIF4E; ref. 11) are impli-
cated downstream. Other critical pathways, such as the MAPK
pathway, have been shown to interact with mTOR in sarcoma, and
cross-talk between them is implicated in treatment-mediated
resistance (20, 21). Most recently, large-scale genomic sequencing
projects have revealed distinct mutations clustered in and around
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis (22‚Äì24), which further verify mTOR as
a valid antitumor target in the treatment of sarcomas.

The importance of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis in sarcoma has
driven interest in therapies targeted to mTOR, and led to a focus
on rapamycin and a group of roughly equivalent structural
analogues (25) termed rapalogues. Despite signiÔ¨Åcant preclinical
enthusiasm, the utility of these Ô¨Årst-generation agents has been
limited because of the allosteric inhibition of only one of the two
mTOR complexes, mTORC1 (26). This inhibition of mTORC1
only leaves the downstream effectors of mTORC2 unchecked,
and contributes to the unwanted reactivation of AKT, which
occurs via release of negative feedback in an IGFIR-dependent
fashion (27). Taken together, these limitations suggest that rapa-
logues do not comprehensively exploit the antitumor potential
of mTOR inhibition, and have driven development of second-
generation agents (28).

MLN0128 (Millennium/Takeda Pharmaceuticals) is a selective,
highly potent, and orally bioavailable adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) competitor of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, which
is currently in phase I and II clinical trials as a single agent in
patients with advanced solid malignancies (NCT01899053,
NCT01058707, NCT01351350, NCT0133183, NCT02091531), in
combination with bevacizumab in patients with glioblastoma
multiforme or advanced solid tumors (NCT02142803), in com-
bination with MLN1117 (PI3K inhibitor) in patients with
advanced nonhematologic malignancies (NCT01899053),
in
combination with ziv-aÔ¨Ålbercept
in recurrent solid tumors
(NCT02159989), and breast cancer (NCT02049957). An addition-
al dose-escalation study in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
or Waldenstrom-Macroglobulinemia has recently been completed
(NCT01118689). Preclinically, MLN0128 has been shown to have
antitumor activity in prostate cancer (29), B-cell leukemia (30),
breast cancer (31, 32), and renal cell carcinoma (33). In the current
study, we describe the preclinical characterization of MLN0128 in
bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, evaluate its in vitro and in vivo effects,
and demonstrate its antitumor properties superior to those of its
Ô¨Årst-generation rapalogue predecessors.

Materials and Methods

Cells were cultured in RPMI media with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, maintained at 37
C in
5% CO2, and passaged for no more than 4 months. Initial stocks
of all cell lines were received from their sources within the past 3
years. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST;
ST8814) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell line RMS-559 were
supplied by Dr. Jonathan Fletcher (Dana Farber Cancer Institute,
Boston, MA). RMS-559 (22), MPNST, and ST8814 (34) cell lines
were authenticated as previously described. Ewing sarcoma
(CHP100, A673) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Melinda S.
Merchant (Center for Cancer Research, NCI/NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines (LS141, DDLS) were
obtained from Dr. Samuel Singer [Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center (MSKCC), New York, NY], and were authenticated
by gene expression proÔ¨Åling before distribution (35). Synovial
sarcoma cell lines (SYO-1 and HSSY-II) were obtained from Dr.
Marc Ladanyi (MSKCC). RMS cell lines Rh28, Rh30, RD, SMS-CTR
and Ewing sarcoma cell lines TE-381, TC32, TC71, and CHLA9
were obtained from Dr. Timothy Triche (University of Southern
California, Los Angeles, CA). SK-RMS -3 and SK-RMS -4 were
derived from patient tissues and provided by Dr. Christine Pratilas
(Johns Hopkins Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Balti-
more, MD). SK-RMS -3 and SK-RMS -4 were derived from patient
tumors and use of patients'
tumor material was conducted un-
der an MSKCC IRB approved protocol for the use of human bio-
specimen (IRB 10-130) and with patient authorization for
research use (IRB 06-107). Osteosarcoma cell line (SaOS2) was
obtained from ATCC. RMS cell lines generously provided by Drs.
Pratilas and Triche were not independently authenticated unless
otherwise mentioned. Cell lines TC32, TC71, CHP100, A673, and
CHLA9 were authenticated using RT-PCR, and found to have their
expected characteristic chromosomal translocations. SYO-1 and
HSSY cell lines were authenticated by conÔ¨Årming the expression
of the pathognomonic SYT-SSX fusion gene by RT-PCR. All cell
lines were determined to be mycoplasma free via testing in the
MSKCC Monoclonal Antibody Core Facility using biochemical
assay MycoAlert.

Cell viability assays

Cell viability assays were carried out using the Dojindo
Molecular Technologies (CCK-8) kit as per manufacturer's
instructions. BrieÔ¨Çy, 2,000 to 5,000 cells were plated in 96-
well plates, allowed to grow overnight, and then treated with
the indicated drugs for 72 hours. Media were replaced with 100
mL of media with 10% serum and 10% CCK-8 solution
(Dojindo Molecular Technologies Kit). After 1 hour, the optical
density was read at 450 nm using a Spectra Max 340 PC
(Molecular Devices Corporation) to determine viability. Back-
ground values from negative control wells without cells were
subtracted for Ô¨Ånal sample quantiÔ¨Åcation. Survival is expressed

cell viability data using CompuSyn software according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

Western immunoblotting

Cells and tissues were lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented
with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics) and
1 mmol/L Na3VO4. Equal amounts (20‚Äì30 mg) of protein were
electrophoresed onto 4% to 12% gradient gels (Life Technologies)
and transferred onto polyvinylidene diÔ¨Çuoride or 0.45-micron
nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5%
nonfat dried milk and probed with primary antibodies. All named
antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (see
Supplementary Table S1 for a complete list of antibodies with
catalog numbers). Ku70 (E-5) antibody was obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Catalog # sc-17789). Bound antibodies were
detected with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (GE
Healthcare) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence
reagent (GE Healthcare).

Xenograft studies

Approximately 8-week-old athymic female mice were injected
with 10 to 15 million cells in Matrigel of the cell line of interest
and allowed to grow until tumors reached 100 mm3 in volume
before treatment with either vehicle, rapamycin, or MLN0128.
Tumors were measured every 2 to 3 days using calipers and
volumes calculated using the formula p/6  (large diameter) 
(small diameter). Animal weights were measured every 2 to 3 days
as a surrogate marker for overall toxicity. Animals were sacriÔ¨Åced 4
hours after the Ô¨Ånal dose of treatment week 1, or 4 hours after the
Ô¨Ånal dose of treatment (week 3 or 5 as indicated). Tumors were
extracted from surrounding tissue and either Ô¨Çash-frozen in liquid
nitrogen for Western immunoblotting or placed in formalin or
paraformaldehyde for
IHC studies. Flash-frozen tissue was
ground in RIPA lysis buffer and resin as per the manufacturer's
instructions using Sample Grinding Kit (GE Healthcare) and
analyzed via Western immunoblotting as described above. For-
malin-Ô¨Åxed tissues were sectioned and stained with the indicated
antibodies following standard protocols in the Molecular Cytol-
ogy Core Facility at MSKCC.

Statistical analysis

All in vitro experiments were carried out at least three times
unless otherwise indicated. P values were calculated using Student
t test, with values of 0.05 determined to be statistically signif-
icant. SE was calculated as the SD divided by the square root of the
number of samples tested.

Results
MLN0128 exhibits potent antiproliferative activity in multiple
sarcoma cell lines and blocks mTORC1/2 targets in a
concentration-dependent fashion in vitro

MLN0128 (Fig. 1A) was tested against a broad panel of bone
and soft-tissue sarcoma cell lines following 3 days of exposure to

increasing concentrations of the drug to determine its antiproli-
ferative activity. MLN0128 was found to inhibit proliferation of
all sarcoma subtypes tested in a dose-dependent fashion at low
nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 1B) with IC50 values ranging
from 2 to 130 nmol/L (Table 1).

At concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 1 mmol/L, the target
inhibition proÔ¨Åle of MLN0128 was examined using Western
immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). Inhibition of mTORC1 activity was
determined using the well-characterized mTORC1 substrates P70-
S6K1 and 4EBP1 (36). Phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein
was used as an additional marker of mTORC1 activity given its
direct phosphorylation by S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). Inhibition of
mTORC2 activity was assessed via phosphorylation of AKT at
Ser473 (pAKTS473). In all sarcoma subtypes tested, MLN0128
potently inhibited each of these anticipated targets in a dose-
dependent fashion (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation of S6 and P70-
S6K1 was inhibited signiÔ¨Åcantly with nearly complete blockade at
low nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 1C). Inhibition of phosphor-
ylation of 4EBP1 and pAKTS473 was also observed at low nano-
molar concentrations (approximately at 100 and 50 nmol/L
respectively, Fig. 1C). AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 was, how-
ever, limited because of weak signal and detection of nonspeciÔ¨Åc
proteins in many of the sarcoma cell lines studied, but when
detectable, MLN0128 inhibited this PDK1 phosphorylation site
(Supplementary Fig. S1A).

MLN0128 demonstrates superior downregulation of mTORC1/
2 substrates when compared with rapamycin

Rapamycin allosterically inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity via
binding of the FKBP12‚Äìrapamycin (FR) complex to the FR-
binding domain of mTORC1 (37), while MLN0128 provides
direct, ATP-competitive kinase inhibition of both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 (29). Although there is evidence for molecular inter-
play between mTORC2 and rapamycin (38, 39), this second
complex is largely unresponsive to rapamycin and related
rapalogues. Western immunoblotting was therefore used to
further investigate the variances in molecular signaling between
rapamycin and MLN0128. Phosphorylation of serum/gluco-
corticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), one of the three isoforms
activated by insulin and other growth factors, is regulated by
mTORC2, but not mTORC1, as evidenced by absence of activity
in mTORC2 knockout Ô¨Åbroblasts (40). Because SGK1 was not
readily detectable by Western immunoblotting (data not
shown), its direct substrate, N-myc downstream-regulated gene
1 (NDRG1), whose activity is also ablated in mTORC2 knock-
out Ô¨Åbroblasts (40), was used in addition to pAKTS473 as a
marker of mTORC2 activity.

Similar to rapamycin treatment, MLN0128 treatment resulted
in concentration-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of
S6K1 and S6. MLN0128, however, also inhibited phosphoryla-
tion of 4EBP1 in all sarcoma subtypes suggesting more compre-
hensive mTORC1 targeting when compared with rapamycin
(Fig. 2A). In addition to complete blockade of the mTORC1

Figure 2.
MLN0128 has a molecular proÔ¨Åle distinct from that of rapamycin. A, eight cell lines representing a broad range of bone and soft-tissue sarcoma subtypes were treated
with indicated concentrations of rapamycin and MLN0128 for 6 hours. Twenty to 30 mg of RIPA lysates was then loaded on SDS/PAGE and immunoblotted using
indicated antibodies. B, cell lines examined in A were treated with MLN0128 for 72 hours to compare the antiproliferative effect of rapamycin and MLN0128.
Cell viability was measured using Dojindo Cell Counting Kit 8 and shown as a percentage of the no-drug control. Note that error bars representing SEM have been
added but are too small to be seen. C, representative cell lines from A and B were treated with indicated concentrations of rapamycin or MLN0128 for 6 hours. Twenty
to 30 mg of RIPA lysates was then loaded on SDS/PAGE and immunoblotted using indicated antibodies.

targets pS6K1, pS6 and p4EBP1, MLN0128 treatment also inhib-
ited phosphorylation of NDRG1 at Thr346 indicating distinct
mTORC2 inhibition. In contrast, rapamycin had no effect on
NDRG1 phosphorylation, supporting its primarily mTORC1
effects (Fig. 2A). Importantly, simultaneous inhibition of both
mTOR complexes by MLN0128 prevented feedback reactivation
of pAKT, whereas rapamycin led to an increase in pAKTS473 (Fig.
2A) as has been previously reported (27, 41). Taken together,
these data indicate that MLN0128 provides more comprehensive
inhibition of the mTOR axis, including superior mTORC1 inhi-
bition when compared with that of rapamycin as evidenced by
downregulation of p4EBP1 in addition to pS6K1 and pS6, effec-
tive targeting of the mTORC2 complex as illustrated by inhibition
of pNDRG1, as well as attenuation of the release of negative
feedback observed with rapamycin treatment.

To determine whether

the broader molecular proÔ¨Åle of
MLN0128 also translated into superior antiproliferative effect in
vitro when compared with rapamycin, concentrations based upon
complete blockade of downstream targets were chosen for
testing. Figure 2B illustrates that MLN0128 treatment resulted in
superior antiproliferative effect compared with that of rapamycin
(P < 0.04 and P < 0.000006 when comparing rapamycin at 20 and
200 nmol/L MLN0128, respectively) across the broad spectrum of
cell lines tested.

MLN0128, but not rapamycin, induces apoptosis in models of
alveolar and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma

MLN0128 was next compared with rapamycin in its ability
to induce cleavage of PARP. In models of alveolar (ARMS, Rh30)
and embryonal (ERMS, SMS-CTR) RMS, MLN0128 treatment at
200 nmol/L induced cleavage of PARP at time points as early as
6 hours (Fig. 2C). Induction of PARP cleavage was also seen in
two other RMS cell lines, RMS-559 as well as SK-RMS -3, only
when treated with MLN0128 but not with rapamycin (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1B). MLN0128, however, was unable to induce
cleavage of PARP in an MPNST and Ewing sarcoma model
(MPNST, CHP100; Fig. 2C) as well as in liposarcoma, leiomyo-
sarcoma, or synovial sarcoma (data not shown). Treatment with
rapamycin, using concentrations established in Fig. 2A, was
unable to induce cleavage of PARP in any of the cell lines tested
(Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S1B, and data not shown).

Both MLN0128 and rapamycin were able to inhibit phospho-
rylation of Rictor, a component of mTORC2, at Thr1135 (Fig. 2C)
as has been shown in previously published studies (39, 42).

To conÔ¨Årm superior in vitro effects of MLN0128 treatment
when compared with those of rapamycin, and that increased
concentrations of rapamycin would not improve the antipro-
liferative potency or induce apoptotic effects in the cell lines
tested, we next tested equivalent concentrations of both rapa-
mycin and MLN0128 up to 1 mmol/L. Figure 3A indicates that
rapamycin exerts its maximal antiproliferative effects at low
concentrations, and continued dose escalation does not poten-
tiate these effects. As observed previously, MLN0128 exhibited
superior antitumor effect when compared with rapamycin in all
cell lines tested.

To further compare the molecular signaling proÔ¨Åles of rapa-
mycin and MLN0128 at higher and equivalent doses, two cell
lines, MPNST and Rh30, were chosen for additional analysis.
Despite using concentrations as high as 1 mmol/L, rapamycin
treatment was unable to effectively inhibit pAKTS473 or
p4EBP1T37/46. Similar to earlier results (Fig. 2C), neither rapa-

mycin nor MLN0128 treatment resulted in induction of cleaved
PARP in MPNST, however, treatment of Rh30 cells with MLN0128
but not with rapamycin resulted in dose-dependent induction of
cleaved PARP as well as cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 3B) strongly
indicating induction of apoptosis.

To further conÔ¨Årm apoptosis in RMS models, an in vitro assay
(Caspase Glo) was carried out to determine induction of
cleaved caspase-3/7 after 6 hours of treatment with rapamycin
or MLN0128 (Fig. 3C). As seen earlier (Fig. 3B), induction of
cleaved caspase-3/7 activity was observed only in the RMS
model, but not in the MPNST model (Rh30 ¬º P < 0.0008 and
P < 0.0006 and MPNST ¬º P < 0.1 and P < 0.09 when comparing
200 and 1 mmol/L, respectively). Overall, it is particularly
notable that markers of apoptosis (cleavage of PARP by West-
ern immunoblotting,
induction of cleaved caspase-3/7 by
Western immunoblotting, induction of cleaved caspase by in
vitro assay) consistently occurred in RMS cell
lines (Rh30
in Figs. 2C and 3B, SMS-CTR in Fig. 2C, RMS-559 and SK-RMS
-3 in Supplementary Fig. S1B), but not in other sarcoma
subtypes. These apoptotic markers occurred at relatively low
and clinically achievable dosing levels (20 and 200 nmol/L),
and were not noted when equivalent and even higher doses of
up to 1 mmol/L of rapamycin were used to treat the same cell
lines. Although the exact mechanism warrants further investi-
gation, these data are highly suggestive of MLN0128's ability to
induce apoptosis in RMS models.

MLN0128 inhibits tumor growth in vivo and is superior to
rapamycin in xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma (CHP100)
and rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30)

The efÔ¨Åcacy of MLN0128 was next tested in multiple tumor
xenograft models. A 1-mg/kg daily dosing schedule had been
previously analyzed and found to be tolerable in other tumor
types (32, 33). Treatment of MPNST and CHP100 xenografts with
MLN0128 resulted in suppression of tumor volume (Fig. 4A and
B) compared with vehicle control. Pharmacodynamic analysis of
tumors harvested 4 hours following last dose showed inhibition
of expected molecular targets pS6, p4EBP1, and pAKT473 (Fig. 4A
and B).

Although MLN0128 activity in these models was conÔ¨Årmed
at a dosing schedule of 1 mg/kg orally daily, only tumor growth
suppression but not tumor stability or regression was noted. In
addition, molecular targets were effectively inhibited but not
comprehensively ablated (Fig. 4A and B) at the tested dose.
Given these observations, and the testing of higher dosing
schedules including 3 mg/kg three times weekly in other tumor
models (32), we next completed a toxicity study to determine
which dosing schedules that provided higher overall dose
intensity were likely to be tolerated (Fig. 4C). This study
indicated that a high-dose, intermittent schedule of 3 mg/kg
twice daily on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays was toler-
able, although 3 mg/kg twice daily on three consecutive days,
that is, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays was not tolerated
and resulted in high toxicity.

Given the tolerability of a 3-mg/kg twice daily Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays dosing schedule, and our hypothesis
that this higher intermittent dosing might provide more compre-
hensive inhibition of downstream targets and therefore tumor
growth, this dosing schedule was next chosen for comparison
against rapamycin. Treatment of CHP100 (Ewing sarcoma) tumor
xenografts with MLN0128 resulted in signiÔ¨Åcantly enhanced

SEM have been added but are too
small to be seen. B, equimolar
concentrations established in A were
used to treat indicated cell lines for 6
hours. Twenty to 30 mg of RIPA lysates
was loaded on SDS/PAGE and
immunoblotted using indicated
antibodies. C, indicated cell lines were
treated with rapamycin or MLN0128
for 6 hours. Induction of caspase-3/7
activity was determined using
CaspaseGlo (Promega) assay

the end of 5 weeks of treatment (P < 0.01). As anticipated, Western
immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 5A) showed inhibition of down-

stream targets such as pAKT and pS6. Similar to in vitro studies,
only MLN0128 but not rapamycin treatment resulted in inhibi-
tion of p4EBP1 in vivo (Fig. 5A).

MLN0128 inhibits tumor growth in
sarcoma xenograft models in vivo . A
and B, MPNST (MPNST) and Ewing
sarcoma (CHP100) xenograft models
were treated with either vehicle
control or MLN0128 1 mg/kg by oral
gavage daily Monday through Friday
and tumor volumes were measured
serially. A subset of tumors was
harvested 4 hours following the last
dose for Western blot analysis. Of
note, 30 to 50 mg of RIPA lysates
obtained using sample grinding kit
(GE healthcare) from xenograft
was loaded on SDS/PAGE and
immunoblotted using indicated
antibodies. V, vehicle; MLN, MLN0128 1

F). C, Ô¨Åve different dosing schedules of
MLN0128 were tested in athymic mice
without tumors to determine
tolerability of higher dosing schedules
than those tested in A and B.

Given the apoptotic potential of MLN0128 in RMS model
in vitro (Fig. 3B and C), we next investigated MLN0128's
in vivo antitumor effects in Rh30 xenografts. MLN0128
resulted in signiÔ¨Åcant tumor suppression when compared
with rapamycin (Fig. 5B, P < 0.001) as well as resulted in
signiÔ¨Åcant inhibition of downstream targets such as pS6 and
p4EBP1 (Fig. 5B). In concordance with the apoptosis observ-
ed in vitro in the Rh30 cell line, IHC analysis of Rh30 xenograft
tissue (Fig. 5C and D) revealed increased cleaved caspase
staining (P < 0.0001).

Discussion

The present study reports the in vitro and in vivo preclinical
characterization of MLN0128, a potent and orally bioavailable
pan-mTOR kinase inhibitor, in a broad range of sarcoma sub-
types. MLN0128 exerts potent antiproliferative effect and has a
molecular signaling proÔ¨Åle distinct from that of rapamycin in vitro
and in vivo. MLN0128 induces apoptosis in models of RMS, and
provides superior antitumor effect when compared with rapamy-
cin in in vivo RMS and Ewing sarcoma models.

MLN0128 is superior to rapamycin in
xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma
and RMS. A and B, Ewing sarcoma
(CHP100) and RMS (Rh30) xenograft
models were treated with vehicle
control, rapamycin 5 mg/kg i.p.
daily Monday to Friday, and MLN0128
3 mg/kg oral gavage twice daily on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and
tumor volumes were measured
serially. Tumors harvested 4 hours
following the last dose were analyzed
by Western blot analysis. Thirty to
50 mg of RIPA lysates obtained using
sample grinding kit (GE healthcare)
from xenograft was loaded on
SDS/PAGE and immunoblotted using
indicated antibodies. V, vehicle; R,
rapamycin 5 mg/kg i.p. daily Monday
to Friday (M-F), MLN, MLN0128
3 mg/kg p.o. daily Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays.
C and D, IHC for cleaved caspase was
performed at the end of drug
treatment on paraformaldehyde
Ô¨Åxed tumors harvested 4 hours after
the last dose. Cleaved caspase signal
(brown staining) was quantitated
using MetaMorph image analysis
software (Molecular Devices).
Quantitation of cleaved caspase
signal obtained from 3 to 5 animals
per treatment condition is shown.

Considerable preclinical and clinical data using Ô¨Årst-gene-
ration allosteric mTORC1 inhibitors have validated mTOR
as an anticancer target, and there is a robust 3-fold rationale
for its speciÔ¨Åc use in the treatment of multiple sarcoma sub-
types. First, hyper-phosphorylation of multiple components
of the mTOR pathway suggests increased activity in numerous
models likely occurring in an autocrine/paracrine fashion

(5, 7‚Äì11). Second, aberrant upstream signals from PDGFR
(15), IGFIR (16, 17), VEGFR (18), FGFR (19, 43) pathways
and others have been shown to contribute to dysregulation
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis in various sarcoma subtypes.
Finally, more recently discovered discrete genetic mutations
(22‚Äì24) in or clustered around the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis,
document vulnerabilities in the genetic landscapes of sarcoma

that can be exploited via mTOR inhibition. The Ô¨Årst-generation
rapamycin and its analogues have had limited clinical utility
despite robust preclinical rationale, thought to be at least
partly a result of release of the negative feedback from S6K1
to insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), leading to an unwanted
increase in the prosurvival pAKT. In addition, rapalogues do
not inhibit 4EBP1 (44), which allows cap-dependent transla-
tion to proceed unchecked, and have essentially no effect on
mTORC2 or its downstream effectors.

MLN0128 potently inhibits proliferation of all sarcoma
cell lines tested in a dose-dependent fashion with IC50 values
in the low nanomolar range (2‚Äì130 nmol/L). Although dif-
ferences in sensitivity between various cell lines tested are not
well explained by the biomarkers used in this study (Fig. 1C),
we can hypothesize that related pathway components, PTEN
or v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF)
status, for example, A673 which carries a BRAF V600E muta-
tion, could play a role in sensitivity to antiproliferative
effects of the drug. Future investigation into such differential
responses to mTOR inhibition is certainly warranted. In con-
trast, rapamycin does not exhibit signiÔ¨Åcant dose dependency
despite escalation to doses as high as 1 mmol/L, and achieves
its maximal antiproliferative effect at very low concentrations.
This threshold effect is consistent with the effective down-
regulation of P-p70-S6K at 1 nmol/L noted in the current
study, as well as the early (10‚Äì20 minutes) feedback reacti-
vation of AKT-S473 that has been documented following
treatment with 1 nmol/L rapamycin (27). These antiprolifera-
tive and molecular signaling events justify the unequal con-
centrations used to compare MLN0128 and rapamycin in the
current work, although we have additionally shown that
equivalent concentrations up to 1 mmol/L of each agent do
not alter outcomes. In all conditions tested in vitro, MLN0128
provides profound antiproliferative effect that is superior to
that of rapamycin.

In all sarcoma subtypes tested, MLN0128 successfully inhib-
ited both of the major regulators of protein synthesis down-
stream of mTORC1, p70-S6K1 (45), and 4EBP1 (46) in a dose-
dependent fashion. In contrast, rapamycin inhibited only P-
p70-S6K as observed in previously published studies (44). In
other tumor types, there is emerging evidence that 4EBP1 is
critical to the response to both rapalogues and mTOR kinase
inhibition (47), making MLN0128's effective downregulation
of particular importance. The exact role that 4EBP1 plays in
mediating the antiproliferative effects of MLN0128 and other
mTOR kinase inhibitors in sarcomas remains under investiga-
tion, and will be indispensable to better understand the role of
mTOR inhibition in sarcoma.

MLN0128 potently inhibited phosphorylation of AKT at
Ser473 in all sarcoma subtypes tested. Analysis of phosphor-
ylation on AKT at Thr308 was limited because of weak signal
and detection of nonspeciÔ¨Åc proteins in many of the sarcoma
cell lines studied, but when detectable, MLN0128 did inhibit
this PDK1 phosphorylation site (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
These data are consistent with that of other mTOR kinase
inhibitors and are likely at least in part due to decreased abi-
lity of PDK to phosphorylate AKT at Thr308 when Ser473
is fully inhibited (48, 49). Genetic knockout of SIN1 or
RICTOR, however, is noted to completely suppress Ser473,
but not Thr308 phosphorylation (50),
suggesting that
MLN0128 may have additional signaling effects not mediated

through mTORC2 that downregulate phosphorylation of AKT
at Thr308.

SGK1 is phosphorylated by mTORC2, but not mTORC1, as
SGK1 activity is ablated in Ô¨Åbroblasts possessing mTORC1 activ-
ity, but lacking the mTORC2 components RICTOR, Sin1, and
mlST8 (40). The physiologic substrate of SGK1, NDRG1 is sim-
ilarly affected making the phosphorylation of NDRG1 a ready
surrogate marker for mTORC2 activity. MLN0128 inhibited the
phosphorylation of NDRG1 in a dose-dependent fashion in all
cell lines tested, corroborating the anticipated mTORC2 kinase
inhibition. As expected, rapamycin had no effect on NDRG1
recapitulating its lack of interaction with mTORC2.

MLN0128 was well-tolerated in vivo and resulted in dose-
dependent growth inhibition in a broad range of sarcoma xeno-
graft models. Pharmacodynamic analysis revealed downregula-
tion of expected targets in vivo, in a fashion consistent with in vitro
data. At a dosing schedule of 3 mg/kg b.i.d. by oral gavage three
times weekly, MLN0128 provided signiÔ¨Åcantly better tumor sup-
pression when compared with rapamycin in tumor xenograft
models of RMS (P < 0.001) and Ewing sarcoma (P < 0.01). In
addition, MLN0128 was able to induce apoptosis seen as
increased cleaved caspase both in vitro and in vivo model of RMS
(Rh30). Further studies are warranted to determine the exact
mechanism by which apoptosis is induced in this tumor subtype
but not others.

In summary, MLN0128 is a potent and orally bioavailable pan-
mTOR kinase inhibitor with effects on both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 and their downstream effectors, and has a molecular
signaling proÔ¨Åle distinct from that of rapamycin. MLN0128
induces dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth superior to
that of rapamycin in a broad range of sarcoma models in vitro.
In models of RMS, MLN0128 induces apoptosis. Finally, in in vivo
models of RMS and Ewing sarcoma, MLN0128 provides superior
antitumor effect when compared with that of
rapamycin.
MLN0128 warrants further evaluation as a potential therapy for
sarcoma.
