Susceptible Stages in Schwann Cells for NF1-Associated
Plexiform Neurofibroma Development

Abstract

Stem cells are under strict regulation by both intrinsic factors and the microenvironment. There is increasing
evidence that many cancers initiate through acquisition of genetic mutations (loss of intrinsic control) in stem
cells or their progenitors, followed by alterations of the surrounding microenvironment (loss of extrinsic
control). In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), deregulation of Ras signaling results in development of multiple
neurofibromas, complex tumors of the peripheral nerves. Neurofibromas arise from the Schwann cell lineage
following loss of function at the NF1 locus, which initiates a cascade of interactions with other cell types in the
microenvironment and additional cell autonomous modifications. In this study, we sought to identify whether a
temporal "window of opportunity" exists during which cells of the Schwann cell lineage can give rise to
neurofibromas following loss of NF1. We showed that acute loss of NF1 in both embryonic and adult Schwann
cells can lead to neurofibroma formation. However, the embryonic period when Schwann cell precursors and
immature Schwann cells are most abundant coincides with enhanced susceptibility to plexiform neurofibroma
tumorigenesis. This model has important implications for understanding early cellular events that dictate
neurofibroma development, as well as for the development of novel therapies targeting these tumors. Cancer Res;

Introduction

Stem cells undergo self-renewal divisions and produce
daughter cells that differentiate into specific tissue lineages,
thus playing an essential
role in tissue homeostasis.
Whether self-renewal or differentiation occurs is under
strict regulation by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
There is increasing evidence that in many tissues, tumor
initiation can result from acquisition of genetic mutations
in stem cells or their progenitors followed by alterations of
the surrounding microenvironment (1–8). Neurofibromato-
sis type 1 (NF1) is a heritable genetic disease in which
afflicted individuals suffer a germ line loss of
function
mutation in 1 allele. Upon stochastic somatic LOH, dereg-
ulation of the Ras signal transduction pathway leads to the
development of multiple neurofibromas, which are benign
tumors of the peripheral nerves. A large body of direct and
indirect studies has provided evidence that NF1 gene dele-
tion in the Schwann cell lineage is the requisite initial step
that precedes the cascade of interactions with other cell

types in the microenvironment and additional cell auton-
omous modifications (3, 9–12). Many studies further suggest
that somatic stem cells or their progenitors may be the cells
of origin of neurofibromas (3, 10). This stem cell model of
tumorigenesis has important implications for understand-
ing early cellular events that dictate neurofibromagenesis
and other tumor types. In addition, the concept of neurofi-
broma as a disease of stem and progenitor cells has impli-
cations for the development of novel therapies targeting
these tumors.

NF1 is one of the most common genetic disorders of the
nervous system, affecting 1 in 3,500 individuals worldwide
(13–15). NF1 patients have a wide spectrum of clinical pre-
sentations, including developmental, pigment or neoplastic
aberrations of the skin, nervous system, bones, endocrine
organs, blood vessels, and eyes. The cardinal features of
NF1 are cafe au lait macules, axillary, and groin freckling,
combined with multiple peripheral and central nerve tumors
(16–20).

The development of neurofibromas, the most frequent
tumor in NF1, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNST) represents a serious complication. These are unique
and complex tumors that contain proliferating Schwann-like
cells and other local supporting elements of the nerve fibers,
including perineurial cells, neurons, fibroblasts, and blood
vessels, as well as infiltration of mast cells. Neurofibromas
are classified as dermal or plexiform. Dermal neurofibromas
are exclusively in the skin and occur in virtually all individuals
with NF1 primarily emerging around puberty. Plexiform neu-
rofibromas, although similar to dermal neurofibromas at the

cellular and ultrastructural
levels, develop along a nerve
plexus. They occur in about 30% of NF1 individuals and are
virtually pathognomonic of the disease (21). Plexiform neu-
rofibromas are thought to be congenital and owing to their
unusual capacity for growth can be life threatening through
physical impairment of organ or neural function. In addition,
patients with plexiform neurofibromas have a 10% lifetime
risk of developing MPNSTs, which can widely metastasize and
often signal a fatal outcome (21, 22). Current treatment
options for NF1-related tumors are primarily limited to sur-
gery and longitudinal surveillance.

The temporally and spatially distinct clinical presentation
of dermal versus plexiform neurofibromas supports the
hypothesis that these neurofibromas may originate from
distinct progenitor cells. The use of mouse models of temporal
and spatial somatic NF1 gene deletion has shed light on this
hypothesis. We recently reported that skin-derived precursors,
a neural crest-like neural stem cell residing in the dermis, are
the cell of origin for dermal neurofibromas (3). Additional and
varied mouse models of NF1 plexiform neurofibromas are
consistent with the idea that some form of Schwann cell
lineage cells are the likeliest candidates to give rise to plexi-
form tumors (9–12, 23, 24). During the development of per-
ipheral nerves, neural crest cells generate myelinating and
nonmyelinating Schwann cells in a process that parallels
embryonic development. Migrating neural crest cells move
through immature connective tissue before the time of nerve
formation at mouse embryonic days E9-E11 and then differ-
entiate into Schwann cell precursors (SCP) between E12-E13.
These SCPs then become immature Schwann cells, which are
generated from E14 until early neonatal stages. The immature
Schwann cells eventually differentiate into mature Schwann
cells after birth (25, 26). Given that the majority of plexiform
neurofibromas are generally detected at birth or in infancy, we
hypothesize that there must exist a temporal "window of
opportunity" for NF1 loss in cells of the Schwann cell lineage
to elicit tumor development. To gain insight into this question,
we employed spatially and temporally controlled Cre driver
transgenes to ablate NF1 function in the Schwann cell lineage
at various developmental time points. In this model, we find
that tumor incidence is highest when NF1 function is deleted
during the embryonic period when SCP and immature
Schwann cells predominate, suggesting that these cells are
the likely sources for plexiform neurofibroma tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods

Mice

All mice were housed in the animal facility at the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (UTSW).
Animal care and use were in compliance with regulations
of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Com-
mittee at UTSW. The NF1flox/ 
mice are in a mixed genetic
background of C57BL/6/Sv129 and have been described pre-
viously (9). For conditional ablation of NF1, we used a tamox-
ifen-inducible Cre line, the PLPCre-ERT2 transgenic mice (27).
The LacZ reporter mice, ROSA26R (28), were obtained from
the Jackson Laboratories.

Cell of Origin for Plexiform Neurofibroma

Tamoxifen induction

Tamoxifen (Sigma) was dissolved in a sunflower oil/ethanol
(10:1) mixture at 10 mg/mL. For embryonic induction, the
pregnant mice were gavaged orally with 1 mg of tamoxifen
twice a day for 1 day during embryogenesis (E12.5). We were
unable to give tamoxifen earlier because it resulted in spon-
taneous abortion. For perinatal induction, 2 mg of tamoxifen
were gavaged orally twice a day for 5 days to lactating mothers
of newborn animals during perinatal period (P0–P5). To
activate Cre activity in adulthood, adult mice were gavaged
orally with 4 mg of tamoxifen a day for 5 days.

Histology, immunostaining, and X-gal staining

For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology analysis, tissue
specimens were harvested and fixed with 10% formalin in PBS
for 1 day and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Sections (5
mm thick) were stained with H&E per manufacturer's protocol
(StatLab). For immunohistochemistry, paraffin sections were
deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval
prior to incubation with the primary antibodies. The primary
antibodies were visualized by treating the sections with
biotinylated secondary antibody and followed by amplifica-
tion with peroxidase-conjugated avidin and 3,3
-diaminoben-
zidine substrate per manufacturer's protocol (Vector Labs).
The dilutions of primary antibodies used in this study are as
follows: GAP43 (rabbit, 1:1,000, Abcam) and S100b (rabbit,
1:5,000, DAKO).

For X-gal staining, mice were anesthetized with ketamine
(1.5 mg per mouse) and subjected to total body perfusion with
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Tissues were harvested, equili-

brated in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4
C, washed 3 times
with 1 PBS and stained with X-gal at 30

C overnight. The
tissues were then postfixed with 10% formalin overnight,
paraffin embedded, sectioned, and counterstained with
nuclear fast red. The X-gal reaction mixture is comprised of
1 mg/mL 4-chloro-5-bromo-3-indolyl-b-galactoside (X-gal), 4
mmol/L potassium ferrocyanide, 4 mmol/L potassium ferri-
cyanide, and 2 mmol/L magnesium chloride in PBS.

Leder stain for mast cells

Leder staining, an enzymatic stain for Naphthol AS-D
(3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid-O-toluidine) chloroacetate ester-
ase to detect tissue mast cells, was done as previously
described (29). Briefly, paraffin sections were deparaffinized,
rehydrated, and placed in pararosaniline veronal acetate
esterase solution for 30 minutes, rinsed in distilled water
for 2 minutes and counterstained with hematoxylin solution.
The tissue slides were then rinsed again in distilled water,
dehydrated, and mounted by using xylene base medium.

the control of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene regulatory
region. The efficiency of this transgene to mediate recombina-
tion in glial cells has been well documented (27, 30). None-
theless, we verified the capability of PLPCre-ERT2 to ablate
genes of interest in peripheral nerves by crossing into the Flox-
stop-Flox ROSA26 (R26R) reporter background (28) to generate
PLPCre-ERT2;R26R mice. Pregnant PLPCre-ERT2;R26R mice
were administered oral tamoxifen at embryonic day 12.5
and embryos were harvested 48 hours later for whole mount
X-gal staining. We observed recombination specifically in the
peripheral nerve plexuses (Fig. 1A). Next, we examined
whether tamoxifen given to lactating mothers would, through
the milk, induce recombination in the developing neonate
peripheral nerves. Oral tamoxifen administration to mothers
for the first 5 days after birth, efficiently induced recombina-
tion in neonate sciatic nerves, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and
trigeminal ganglia as assessed by X-gal staining (Fig. 1B).
Finally, tamoxifen administration to adult (2–3 months old)
mice induced recombination in sciatic nerves, DRG, and
trigeminal ganglia thus showing the power and specificity
of the temporally and spatially inducible PLPCre-ERT2 trans-
gene (Fig. 1C).

Inducible PLP-Cre–mediated NF1 loss during the SCP
stage leads to plexiform neurofibroma formation

In mice, SCPs are present at E12-E13 and begin the transition
from precursor to immature Schwann cell in the developing
peripheral nerves between E14 and E15. The differentiation of
immature Schwann cells to form the nonmyelinating and
myelinating cells of mature nerves is essentially postnatal
(25, 31). We selectively ablated NF1 function at different stages
of Schwann cell development as follows: we bred the PLPCre-
ERT2 mice with NF1þ/ 
mice to generate PLPCre-ERT2;NF1þ/ 
progeny. These mice were then crossed with NF1flox/flox;R26R
mice to generate PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ ;R26R mice. We used
PLPCre-ERT2;NF1þ/flox;R26R as controls.

We selectively ablated embryonic NF1 expression at the SCP
stage by giving 1 mg of tamoxifen orally twice at embryonic
day 12.5 to pregnant NF1flox/flox;R26R female mice that have
been bred with PLP-CreERT2;NF1þ/ 
male mice (Fig. 2). Ear-
lier administration than E12.5 resulted in spontaneous abor-
tion. The E12.5;PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ ;R26R progeny showed
classic signs of illness beginning at 5 to 6 months of age and
were necropsied along with control littermates. In all cases,
the mice exhibited tumors along the cervical and thoracic

DRG that impinged on the spinal cord (Fig. 3). Histopathologic
analysis of these tumors indicated that the tumors exhibited
cardinal features of plexiform neurofibromas (Fig. 3). Tumor
sections were also evaluated immunohistochemically and
all the E12.5;PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ ;R26R tumors exhibited
Schwann cell marker (S100b) immunoreactivity. Ultrastruc-
tural evaluation of the tumors revealed abundant collagen and
prominent disorganized spindle cells with cytoplasmic pro-
cesses and abundant mast cell infiltration into the tumors, as
assessed by morphologic, histologic, and enzymatic criteria.
These findings indicated that PLP-Cre–mediated ablation of
NF1 in Schwann cells at the precursor stage is sufficient to
initiate plexiform neurofibroma formation, with the resultant
neurofibromas exhibiting defining histologic features of the
human counterpart.

Induction of NF1 ablation during the immature
Schwann cell stage leads to peripheral nerve
hyperplasia and plexiform neurofibroma formation

We next tested whether targeting NF1 in neonates when
most Schwann cells are in the immature stage would lead to
neurofibroma formation. Lactating mothers were adminis-
tered 2 mg of tamoxifen orally twice a day for 5 days following
birth (Fig. 2). We and others, have previously established that
lactating mothers can effectively transmit tamoxifen through
the milk and induce recombination in the peripheral nerves of
neonates (Fig. 1B; refs. 27, 32). Although the littermate con-
trols remained healthy, the P0tam;PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ 
mice
began to show signs of lethargy, weight loss, and paralysis at 5
to 6 months of age requiring that they will be sacrificed. Gross
dissection of the sick mice revealed obvious enlargement of
peripheral nerves (Fig. 4A, arrows), specifically in the brachial
plexus, thoracic nerves, and sciatic nerves. We also observed
the presence of plexiform neurofibromas in close proximity to
the DRGs, in all of the sick P0tam;PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ 
mice
(Fig. 4B and C). These neurofibromas exhibited the classic
characteristics of human plexiform neurofibromas, being
poorly circumscribed, composed primarily of spindle cells,

and expressing the Schwann cell markers S100b and GAP43
(Fig. 5). We also observed heavy infiltration of mast cells into
these plexiform neurofibromas, a critical component of tumor
initiation, that is, commonly observed in human neurofibro-
mas (Fig. 5). These data indicated that at the immature
Schwann cell stage, like in the embryonic precursor cell stage,
abundant competent cells are present that when subjected to
NF1 loss give rise to plexiform neurofibroma formation.

Schwann cell–specific NF1 ablation in adult mice rarely
leads to plexiform neurofibroma formation

The postnatal fate of immature Schwann cells is terminal
differentiation into mature Schwann cells that ensheath large
and small diameter axons throughout the peripheral nervous
system (PNS). In the mouse, this process is essentially com-
pleted by postnatal day 21 (33). To determine whether induced
loss of NF1 at the mature stage of Schwann cell development
would lead to neurofibroma formation, we used oral gavage to
administer 4 mg of tamoxifen a day for 5 days to adult (2–4
months of age) Atam;PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ ;R26R and control
mice to activate Cre activity. Five days after the last tamoxifen
dose, we harvested DRGs and nerves for both X-gal staining
and genotype analysis. We observed that both the DRGs and
isolated peripheral nerves were positive for X-gal staining,
indicating that the gavaged tamoxifen was able to penetrate
the peripheral nervous system and induce recombination
at the flox sites within these tissues (Fig. 6). Although
virtually 100% of E12.5tam- or P0tamPLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ 
mice robustly developed paraspinal plexiform neurofibromas
near the DRGs when NF1 was ablated at the precursor or
immature Schwann cell stage, the picture was significantly
different with the Atam;PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ ;R26R mice.
Two of 19 Atam;PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ ;R26R mice were sacri-
ficed in their second year of life when they developed signs of
sickness including lethargy, ruffled hair, weight loss, and limb
paralysis. Gross autopsy analysis revealed that one of the 2 sick
mutant mice (of 19) developed plexiform neurofibroma only at
the cervical paraspinal areas, whereas the other mutant mouse

developed both paraspinal plexiform neurofibromas and a
classic plexiform neurofibroma within the left hindlimb, caus-
ing left leg gigantism (Fig. 6). This clinical presentation is a
pathognomonic feature seen in NF1 patients with plexiform
neurofibroma on the leg (21, 34, 35) but has never been
reported in any of the previously published NF1 mouse
models. These tumors were analyzed histopathologically
and all results indicated that they were, in fact, plexiform
neurofibromas, exhibiting the classic characteristics of human
plexiform neurofibromas including being poorly circum-
scribed, composed primarily of spindle cells, and expressing
the Schwann cell marker S100b.

These results indicated that NF1 ablation within the
Schwann cell lineage in adult mice rarely leads to plexiform
neurofibroma formation. In addition, these mice develop
tumors after a much longer period of time (more than 1.5
years) and with very limited samples show tumor develop-
ment at an additional anatomical location (on the leg along

the sciatic nerve causing leg gigantism). On the other hand,
virtually 100% of the PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ 
mice in which NF1
is ablated at the precursor or immature Schwann cell stages
develop paraspinal plexiform neurofibromas exclusively near
the DRGs within 5 to 7 months after tamoxifen induction.
Whether more peripheral manifestation is preempted in the
mice induced earlier by the rapid development of internal
tumors remains to be determined.

Discussion

Tumor cell of origin

Recent progress points to the importance of stem cells and
their immediate progenitors in the initiation and maintenance
of many cancers consistent with the notion that these neo-
plasms originate in a subset of primitive precursor cells and
that most cells in an organ do not generate tumors (1–8).

that
develop along nerve plexuses and are thought to derive from

the embryonic Schwann cell lineage (10, 11, 36). However,
identification of the cell of origin of plexiform neurofibromas
has yet to be resolved.

Figure 6. NF1 ablation in adulthood rarely leads to plexiform neurofibroma formation. Adult PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ Rosa26 and control mice
were orally gavaged with 4 mg of tamoxifen a day for 5 days to activate Cre activity. We then harvested DRG, sciatic nerve (SN), and trigeminal ganglia
(TG) for X-gal staining to confirm recombination (A; a–c). We also observe the colocalization of X-gal stain with S100 marker (brown color) in a
cross section of nerve fiber (A; d, arrow) and horizontal section of the DRG (A; e, arrow). The majority of the PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ 
mice (17 of 19 mice)
did not develop macroscopic or microscopic plexiform neurofibroma into their second year of life when NF1 is ablated at the mature Schwann cell stage
(B). Only about 10% (2 of 19 mice) of PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ 
mice develop tumors, including spinal neurofibroma (C, arrow head) and a classic plexiform
neurofibroma at the left hindlimb causing left leg gigantism (D, arrow).

of the clinical presentations of NF1, including neurofibroma.
In human neurofibromas, Schwann-like cells with biallelic NF1
mutations are the most consistently found cell type, leading to
the argument that the tumors initiate in Schwann cells or their
earlier precursors. Indeed, genetic mouse models have shown
that NF1 gene deletion in the embryonic Schwann cell lineage
is the genetic bottleneck for neurofibroma development (9–12,
23, 24). Conditional deletion of NF1 from fetal neural crest
stem cells (NCSC) by using Wnt-1-Cre transgenic mice leads to
a transient increase in NCSC frequency and self-renewal but
the isolated NCSCs fail to form tumors upon transplantation
(12), suggesting that early NCSC derivatives may not contain
potential cells of origin for neurofibroma (Fig. 7). However,
these negative data are not conclusive and,
if ultimately
correct, still leave open the question of which later NCSC
derivatives give rise to the neurofibroma; the committed

mature Schwann cell, or earlier immature Schwann cell, or
postcrest precursor cells.
Recently, Zheng and colleagues reported that conditional
ablation of NF1 from the SCP stage by using P0A-Cre;NF1flox/ 
mice, which ablates NF1 continuously from early Schwann cell
progenitors through mature cells, efficiently induces neurofi-
broma formation; based on observed abnormalities in Remak
bundles, they proposed that nonmyelinating mature Schwann
cells give rise to neurofibromas (11). On the other hand, Wu
and colleagues proposed that the neurofibroma cell of origin
corresponds to cells at the boundary between SCPs and
immature Schwann cells as they observed that the neurofi-
bromas that develop in DhhCre;Nf1flox/flox mice contain large
numbers of BLBPþ/S100bþ cells, indicating that cells similar
to immature Schwann cells accumulate in these tumors (10).

Figure 7. Diagram outlining the stages of Schwann cell development and the periods of Cre-mediated recombination in various neurofibroma
models. Neural crest cells generate mature Schwann cells in a process that parallels embryonic development: migrating neural crest cells move
through immature connective tissue before the time of nerve formation at E9-E11, and then differentiate into SCPs between E12-E13. These SCPs then
become immature Schwann cells, which are generated from E14 until right after birth. The immature Schwann cells eventually differentiate into mature
Schwann cells in the postnatal period. Cre-mediated recombination to ablate NF1 expression in the NCSCs by using the Wnt-1 promoter does not result in
neurofibroma formation (12). However, NF1 inactivation with Cre recombinase expression driven by the Krox20, P0A, or Dhh promoter does result in
neurofibroma formation (9–11). The Krox20Cre;NF1flox/ 

of life. These sick mutant mice exhibit neurofibroma formation throughout the PNS. The DhhCre;NF1flox/flox also develop plexiform neurofibromas
near the DRG, predominately at lower cervical or upper thoracic levels leading to paralysis and requiring sacrifice by 13 months of age. A portion of
these mice also has neurofibromas located under the dermal muscle layer in the back at the thoracic and lumbar areas (9, 10). Although PLPCre-ERT2;NF1flox/ 
mutant mice robustly develop paraspinal neurofibroma near the DRG when NF1 is ablated at, or prior to, the neonatal period, the inactivation of NF1
specifically in adulthood rarely leads to plexiform neurofibroma formation in this model.

mice develop signs of sickness including lethargy, ruffled hair, and hindlimb paralysis in their second year

mice develop only paraspinal neurofibroma and require sacrificing at 10 to 12 months of

compromise NF1 function at the earliest Schwann cell stages
of development (at E12.5), and the Cre recombinase activity
persists through the mature Schwann cell stage. Therefore, it
is not possible to pinpoint or exclude any particular Schwann
cell developmental stage as the critical one for NF1 loss–
mediated tumor development. The interpretation of the data
instead rests on correlations relating to detectable appearance
of abnormal cells or structures. To circumvent this problem,
we used a transgenic mouse line, PLP-CreERT2, in which Cre
activity is primed for activity in the Schwann cell lineage and
inducible by tamoxifen, thus allowing temporal control of
gene ablation (Fig. 7).

The cell of origin of neurofibroma

When NF1 was inactivated in adult mice between 2 to
4 months of age, only about 2% of the mutant mice developed
neurofibroma. On the other hand, virtually 100% of the mutant
mice developed paraspinal neurofibromas when NF1 was
ablated at the precursor or immature Schwann cell stage.
Thus, the mice are most susceptible to develop paraspinal
plexiform neurofibroma when the LOH of the wild-type NF1
allele occurs during the stages when precursor and immature
Schwann cells are predominant, indicating that the precursors

and/or immature Schwann cells may have the capacity to give
rise to plexiform neurofibroma (Fig. 7). However, the fact that
NF1 inactivation in adult mice also gives rise to neurofibroma,
although at a much lower frequency, indicates that either (i)
mature Schwann cells can, in rare cases, give rise to neurofi-
broma or (ii) that rare populations of precursor or immature
Schwann cells persist within the adult PNS. A third alternative
is that the neurofibromas that arise during the embryonic or
perinatal period originate from a different cell of origin/
progenitor than those that arise in adulthood. Finally,
although we observe the colocalization of X-gal stain with
adult Schwann cell markers (Fig. 6A, d–e), we cannot exclude
the possibility that adult mice may induce recombination less
efficiently at the NF1 locus than the Rosa26 locus in adult
Schwann cells from the peripheral nerves.

The level of resolution afforded by temporal targeting of
NF1 with tamoxifen-inducible PLP-CreERT2 has limitations.
First, we were unable to generate viable embryos upon
tamoxifen administration prior to E12.5. Therefore, we were
unable to directly address the potential of the earliest NCSC
stages to give rise to tumors. Second, the Schwann cell lineage
does not undergo transition en masse at tightly defined times
from the NCSC stage, to the precursor stage, to the immature

stage, and onward to more differentiated stages. Instead,
gradients of cells transition over extended periods and there
exists considerable overlap between the disappearance of 1
population and the emergence of another (Fig. 7). Whether the
tamoxifen inductions at birth-targeted residual precursors or
immature Schwann cell populations could not be distin-
guished. On this basis, we cannot exclude the possibility that
in addition to SCPs, immature Schwann cell lineages may also
retain tumor-forming potential.

The ability of mature Schwann cells to give rise to tumors is
less evident. Individuals afflicted with NF1 rarely present with
plexiform tumors for the first time in adults (21). Indeed, most
such cases are clinically interpreted to be a manifestation of a
longtime indolent, subclinical tumor. Schwann cell matura-
tion and terminal differentiation into myelinating cells mostly
occurs postnatally. If mature Schwann cells as a whole can
give rise to neurofibromas when LOH occurs in adulthood,
then neurofibromas should develop robustly in our PLP-
CreERT2 mice induced postnatally because cre-mediated
recombination remains efficient in mature Schwann cells
(Fig. 6). The fact that neurofibromas develop only rarely in
this scenario can only be explained either by a very rare set of
circumstances that render an NF1 / 
mature Schwann cell
capable of developing into a tumor or alternatively, the very
rare presence of progenitor/immature Schwann cells that,
when targeted at NF1, then give rise to the tumor.

Vestigial compartments of Schwann progenitor/immature
cells may also persist into adulthood and retain the capacity to
form plexiform neurofibromas within the peripheral nerves. In
fact, NCSCs can be found at sites of gliogenesis, including the
sciatic nerve and DRG (37, 38). Strikingly, stem/progenitor cells
exhibiting NCSC features, such as the ability to self-renew and
differentiate into various cell types typical for the neural crest,
including Schwann cells have been isolated in adult DRGs and
other tissues (39–44). Although the physiologic role of these
adult NCSC-related cells remains to be elucidated, they have
the capacity to give rise to PNS tumors such as neurofibroma
(3). As such, it is entirely possible that when NF1 is ablated at, or
prior to, the neonatal period, plexiform neurofibromas arise
from the embryonic Schwann cells. On the other hand, the
adult NCSC-related stem cells or their precursor/immature
Schwann cell derivatives may be the cell of origin for neurofi-
bromas in adulthood. This may explain why only paraspinal
neurofibromas develop in the DRG when NF1 is ablated at, or
prior to, the neonatal period, but in the few mice that develop
neurofibromas when NF1 is inactivated in adulthood, the
tumor develops along the sciatic nerve in the left hindlimb
causing left leg gigantism, a phenotype that has never been

mutant mice when
tamoxifen is given transiently early in embryonic development.
Our data, and those of Mayes and colleagues (submitted
manuscript), who used a different inducible PLP-Cre trans-
gene to ablate NF1, show that acute loss of NF1 at either the
embryonic or the adult Schwann cell stage can lead to
neurofibroma formation. There are, however, considerable
differences between the 2 studies. Mayes and colleagues
observed a high incidence of hematopoietic expansion and
splenomegaly, a hallmark of juvenile chronic myelogenous
leukemia, which is a rare malignancy associated with NF1.
Their mutant mice also develop facial neurofibromas asso-
ciated with the cranial nerves, a feature we did not observe in
our model. In fact, we do not see any hematopoietic tumor or
neurofibromas above the cervical level in our model. These
differences in scope of pathology (hematopoietic) indicate
that the independently derived tamoxifen-inducible PLP-Cre
transgene used by Mayes and colleagues must have broader
tissue targets than the transgene used in our study whose
activity is confined essentially to the glial cell lineage (Fig. 1;
ref. 27). The higher prevalence of adult tumors observed by
Mayes and colleagues could additionally be a reflection of
differing modes of tamoxifen exposure. In our study, tamox-
ifen was delivered by oral gavage whereas Mayes and collea-
gues used intraperitoneal injection for tamoxifen delivery.
